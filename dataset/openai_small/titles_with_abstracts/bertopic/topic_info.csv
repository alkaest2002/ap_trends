The results demonstrate that ATCOs’ visual scan patterns had significant differences between acoustic and semantic designs. ATCOs established different eye movement patterns on fixations number, fixation duration and saccade velocity. Effective decision support systems require human-centered design with effective stimuli to direct ATCO’s attention to critical events. It is necessary to provide ATCOs with specific alerting information to reflect the nature of the critical situation in order to minimise the side effects of startle and inattentional deafness. Consequently, the design of a semantic alert can significantly reduce ATCOs’ response time, therefore providing valuable extra time in a time-limited situation to formulate and execute resolution strategies in critical air safety events. The findings of this research indicate that the context-specified design of semantic alerts could improve ATCO’s situational awareness and significantly reduce response time in the event of Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activation which alerts to two aircraft having less than the required lateral or vertical separation. Practitioner Summary: Eye movements are closely linked with visual attention and can be analysed to explore shifting attention whilst performing monitoring tasks. This research has found that context-specific designed semantic alerts facilitated improved ATCO cognitive processing by integrating visual and auditory resources. Semantic designs have been demonstrated to be superior to acoustic design by directing the operator’s attention more quickly to critical situations.Abbreviations: APW: area proximity warning; ASRS: aviation safety reporting system; ATC: air traffic control; ATCO: air traffic controller; ATM: air traffic management; COOPANS: cooperation between air navigation service providers; HCI: human-computer interaction; IAA: irish aviation authority; MSAW: minimum safe altitude warning; MTCD: medium-term conflict detection; SA: situation awareness; STCA: short term conflict alert; TP: trajectory prediction. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>', ""<title>Vape and Aviate: Electronic-Cigarette Use and Misuse in Naval Aviation</title> <abstract>Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (EC) are an emerging form of nicotine replacement that has had a discernible increase in prevalence in the general population. Little is known regarding EC use among different military demographic groups or the extent of influence that social determinants of health may have on the behavior. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of EC use in a select population of active duty U.S. Naval personnel. This study is unique in that it allows for EC behavior comparison between a traditionally healthy demographic (aviators, a subset of aircrew) and a representative general military population sample. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected anonymously and analyzed in 2015-2016. Active duty Naval personnel (n = 977) were asked about ever trying ECs, frequency of use, and when was the last time an EC was used. Participants were assessed similarly regarding cigarette use. Descriptive and inferential statistics as well as multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted using categorical and ordinal variables assigned to usage and demographic factors. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Naval Hospital Portsmouth located in Portsmouth, Virginia. Results: Within the study population, 31.4% have tried ECs, 9.3% were current users, and only 3.8% were dual (EC and cigarettes) users. EC use was significantly associated with paygrade (enlisted), primary job duty (non-aircrew), and education (less than a bachelor degree, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively). ECs were used at some point as a smoking cessation tool for 43.6% of current EC users (p < 0.001), 21.6% of current smokers, and only 5.6% of former smokers. Continued EC use after ever trying ECs (30.0%) was only slightly more prevalent as continued cigarette use after ever trying cigarettes (27.3%). Smokers were nearly five times more likely to currently use ECs compared with non-smokers. Trying cigarettes was associated with nearly 12 times the risk for trying ECs compared with those who never tried cigarettes. No significant misuse of ECs was noted; however, several cases of drinking, tasting, and touching EC fluid were reported. Conclusion: This study is unique in that it examines the use of electronic cigarettes among selected healthy and baseline groups within the active duty U.S. Navy population. The current prevalence of EC use among active duty personnel is much higher than previously thought. Continued use of ECs after ever trying them appears to exceed that of cigarettes even among healthy populations such as aircrew. The findings of increased risk of EC use among those with lower income and less than a bachelor's degree suggest social determinants of health implications. This study sheds new light on EC use, characteristics of use, addiction implications, and highlights concerns for a growing health risk behavior. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2018.

This study aimed to introduce the fitness-to-fly criteria for military aviators with UIAs in our center and try to develop evidence-based aeromedical guidelines.\xa0We retrospectively reviewed active-duty military aviators diagnosed as UIAs by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in a single center between 2019 and 2024. A multidisciplinary team performed comprehensive rupture risk stratification to determine patients for intervention. Afterwards, a dedicated aeromedical review board evaluated in-flight incapacitation risk and flight eligibility in the non-intervention group. Clinical features, aneurysm characteristics (size, location, morphology) and the final aeromedical disposition of these untreated cases were reported and analyzed.\xa0Twenty-three active-duty military aviators were diagnosed with UIAs by DSA at our institution over a 5-year period. Seven patients underwent intervention, whereas 16 were placed under conservative surveillance. All conservatively managed cases involved male aviators (mean age: 36 years) with small (< 5\xa0mm), saccular UIAs, primarily in the paraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) segments (68.8%). None had hypertension or smoking history. The estimated annual rupture risk was < 0.5% for small paraclinoid aneurysms and nearly 0% for cavernous ICA aneurysms. Therefore, flight clearance was granted with operational restrictions for 11 pilots with small paraclinoid aneurysms (dual-seat or captaincy duties), while 5 with cavernous ICA aneurysms received unrestricted certification. Annual case-by-case inspections, along with MRA surveillance and psychological support, are required.\xa0This study represents one of the largest real-world practice of aeromedical certification for untreated UIAs. The annual rupture risk is extremely low (< 0.5%) for small saccular aneurysms located at the medial wall of the paraclinoid segment and nearly negligible for those in the cavernous segment of the ICA. Granting flight qualification to military personnel with such aneurysms is medically appropriate, provided enhanced surveillance protocols are implemented. Our protocol maximizes retention of experienced aircrew while ensuring operational safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>', '<title>Monitoring antioxidant defenses and free radical production in space-flight, aviation and railway engine operators, for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, immunological impairment, and pre-mature cell aging</title> <abstract>Degenerative diseases, immune impairment, and premature ageing commonly affect professional categories exposed to severe environmental and psychological stress. Among these, cosmonauts routinely experience extreme conditions due to microgravity, space radiation, altered oxygen supply, physical and mental fatigue during training, spaceflight, and post-flight. Long route aviation pilots display elevated oncogenic risk, connected with cosmic radiation overexposure, and high mortality rates for cardiovascular causes. Engine drivers, like pilots, are affected by health consequences of psycho-emotional stress, and burnout syndrome. The free radical (FR)/antioxidant (AO) imbalance is a common feature in all these pathological conditions. To assess the effective relevance of oxidative stress, we analyzed blood and urine reliable markers of FR production and AO defenses in 12 Russian cosmonauts, 55 airline pilots, 63 train engine drivers, and 50 age-matched controls by measuring the following: (a) lipophilic/hydrophilic low-molecular weight AO and AO enzyme activities, (b) nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroperoxide production, and (c) urinary catecholamine/serotonine metabolites and lipoperoxidation markers. Cosmonauts showed elevated granulocyte superoxide and nitric oxide production, increased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione oxidation, and drastically decreased plasma/leucocyte lipophilic AO levels (P\xa0<\xa00.001–0.01). Aviation pilots, like train drivers, displayed a mild but constant oxidative stress, more pronounced in intercontinental routes pilots, and consistent with lymphocyte chromosomal alterations, DNA oxidation, and cardiovascular malfunction. Results obtained on these selected professionals operating under wearing conditions offer a solid molecular basis for advising the regular monitoring of clinical biochemistry laboratory markers of AO/FR status, to tailor individually specific AO supplementation and diet regimen, and monitor treatment outcomes. © 2009, SAGE Publications.

Objective: To compare the difference of mental health between aircrew and ground crew of army airmen and provide reference data for implementing corresponding norms. Design: Chester sampling investigation and paired design were applied. Setting: the 71687 Force of Chinese PLA, the 71521 Force of Chinese PLA, Department of Epidemiology, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA Participants: By chester sampling, 122 aircrew and 122 ground crew of one army airmen in one stationed training troop were randomized in February 2001. The pairs were made at ratio of 1:1 according to age difference less than 3 years and same sex and nationality. The investigated persons were all male, of Han and aged varied from 23 to 52 years. Methods: Cornell health questionnaire was adopted respectively in investigation of aircrew and ground crew of army airmen. The investigated persons finished and handed in questionnaire independently on the spot in manner of secretion and centralized filling-up. Cornell health questionnaire is composed of 18 sections, including 195 questions, involving 4 aspects, named somatic symptoms, medial and family history, general health and habit and mental symptoms. The total score of Cornell health questionnaire ≥ 30 indicates somatic and mental disturbance and the score of mental section ≥ 10 indicates mental disturbance, both of which are taken as the criteria in comparison of psychological health in receptors of two groups. Main outcome measures: Every factor score and total score in somatic and mental sections in Cornell health questionnaire for aircrew and ground crew. Results: The tested results of each 122 cases in either aircrew group or ground crew group entered result analysis. Evaluated results of somatic and mental symptoms in receptors of two groups: the total score was low in Cornell health questionnaire (0-14 scores), of which, the total score in aircrew group was higher than that in ground crew group (81.5% and 59.8%, P < 0.05); the score in mental section was low (0-9 scores), of which, that in aircrew group was higher remarkably than that in ground crew group (99.2% and 91.8%, P < 0.01); the score for the receptors with somatic and mental disturbance (total score ≥ 30, score in mental section ≥ 10) in aircrew group was lower than those in ground crew group (4.1% and 12.3%, P < 0.05); the score for the receptors with mental disturbance (score in mental section ≥ 10) in aircrew group was lower remarkably than ground crew group (0.8% and 8.2%, P < 0.01). For somatic section in aircrew group, except the factors of muscle, skeleton and skin, their scores were higher than those in ground crew group (P > 0.05), the scores of the rest factors were all lower than those in ground crew group, of which, the difference was significant in evaluation of factors of eye, ear, nervous system, urinary reproductive system and fatigue in comparison of two groups (P < 0.05). The score of every factor in mental section of aircrew group was lower than those in ground crew group. Except tension factor, in comparison of the rest factors in two groups, the significant difference was present (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Overall psychological health state in Cornell questionnaire of aircrew in army airmen was superior to ground crew. Aircrew still presents a part of psychological health questions, mainly in somatic section and inadaptability was the most positive response in mental section, suggesting that aircrew probably presents inadaptable phenomena.</abstract>']"

This condition impacts physiological and psychological function, causing symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and decreased oxygen saturation. Although this condition is essential for military aircraft crews who frequently operate at these altitudes, there is a lack of research that explicitly explores its impact, especially regarding subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation. Objective: To evaluate and understand the effect of hypoxia on the subjective symptoms experienced by military aircrew and its effect on their oxygen saturation when operating at high altitudes and determine the relationship of subjective symptoms differentiated by age and saturation. Methods: This is a prospective, controlled, cross-sectional study conducted at a single center, recruiting 64 military aircrew members for a one-time session that includes an intermediate phase and subsequent hypoxia exposure in a high-altitude chamber. Result: The study gathered data on physiological responses to hypobaric conditions at 25,000 feet in a hypobaric chamber, detailing subjective symptoms and reduced oxygen saturation levels during hypoxia at this altitude. Noted hypoxia symptoms included dizziness, tingling, a floating feeling, and memory lapses. Additionally, oxygen saturation levels were observed to drop below 70%. The hypoxia observed in the study was attributed to altitude, with an understanding that higher elevations result in lower partial pressure. Conclusion: These findings conclude that physiological changes in subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation occur in military aircraft crew experiencing hypoxia at an altitude of 25,000 feet. No significant correlation was found between age, saturation and the subjective symptoms experienced, except for muscle weakness, which appears to be more common in individuals over 33 years of age. © 2024 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

In the stratosphere, when the aircraft cockpit is depressurized, the pilot switches to breathing pressurized oxygen. However, breathing under such conditions leads to the development of adverse processes that affect the functional state of the body and reduce the quality of aircraft piloting. Programs of psychophysiological training of pilots for such conditions include breathing and speech training under oxygen overpressure. Objective. Effectiveness assessment of a five-day breathing and speech training course under oxygen overpressure in Vietnamese test subjects. Materials and methods. The study involved 35 Vietnamese test subjects aged 19-32. The assessment of the development of breathing skills under oxygen overpressure (OOP) was based on the dynamics of psychological parameters and the pronunciation accuracy of control words. The study used a KM-35 demand oxygen mask in combination with a ZSh-7A pilot protective helmet and a VKK-15 altitude compensating suit to create counterpressure on the chest. OOP was created using the BARS-GD hardware and software complex. The developed course of breathing and speech training under OOP consists of five OOP breathing sessions, which are conducted once a day during five consecutive days. Each session involves breathing under OOP in a sequential and continuous manner at five stages with a breathing time of 2 min at each stage. OOP was created at levels ranging 150-1000 mmHg. The functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) was assessed based on the average time of simple and complex visual-motor reactions (SVMR, CVMR) and the response to a moving object (RMO). The level of situational anxiety, well-being, activity, and mood was assessed using the wellbeing, activity, mood (WAM) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 26 software. Results. As a result of the five-day training course, a statistically significant decrease in the pre-stress level of situational anxiety by 3.9% was observed. Prior to the training course, in the setting of simulated rapid cockpit decompression, a decrease in well-being and mood indicators by 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively, was noted. In addition, the experiment recorded an increase in psychophysiological reserves, which was confirmed by statistically significant changes in the time of simple and complex visual-motor reactions, as well as the results of testing the response to a moving object before and after the training course. Conclusions. The data obtained confirmed the effectiveness of the developed five-day training course, as a result of which the test subjects increased their psychological and psychophysiological readiness to perform tasks under conditions of a sharp decrease in pressure in the pressurized cabin of an aircraft and the operation of high-altitude equipment. The developed five-day training regime of Vietnamese military personnel is recommended for integration into the training system of pilots for high-altitude and stratospheric flights. © A.А.

However, limited research supports the improvement of cognitive function and mood state in women. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hypoxia and exercise on working memory and mood state in women. METHODS: There were 15 healthy women (age = 22 ± 2 yr) who completed the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4 th Edition (ANAM), including the Running Memory Continuous Performance Task (RMCPT) and Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) in normoxia (21% O<inf>2</inf> ), at rest in normoxia and hypoxia (12.5% O<inf>2</inf> ), and during cycling exercise at 60% and 40% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> in hypoxia. RESULTS: RMCPT was not significantly impaired at 30 (100.3 ± 17.2) and 60 (96.6 ± 17.3) min rest in hypoxia compared to baseline in normoxia (97.0 ± 17.0). However, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (106.7 ± 20.8) at 60% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia. Following 30 ( - 89.4 ± 48.3) and 60 min of exposure to hypoxia ( - 79.8 ± 55.9) at rest, TMD was impaired compared with baseline ( - 107.1 ± 46.2). TMD was significantly improved during exercise (- 108.5 ± 42.7) at 40% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared with 30 min rest in hypoxia. Also, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (104.0 ± 19.1) at 60% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia (96.6 ± 17.3). DISCUSSION: Hypoxia and an acute bout of exercise partially influence RMCPT and TMD. Furthermore, a moderate-intensity bout of exercise (60%) may be a more potent stimulant for improving cognitive function than low-intensity (40%) exercise. The present data should be considered by aeromedical personnel performing cognitive tasks in hypoxia. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Comparison of hypobaric hypoxia symptoms between a recalled exposure and a current exposure</title> <abstract>Background Aircrew members are required to attend hypoxia awareness training regularly to strengthen their memory of their personal hypoxia symptoms by undergoing training inside a hypobaric chamber. The aim of this study was to examine the association between hypoxia symptoms experienced during two training sessions that were 4 years apart. Methods This was a crossover study to compare hypoxia symptoms and self-reported physiological effects of trapped gas between a previous training session and a current training session in an altitude chamber. The subjects were military crew members who undertook a 25,000-feet refresher training course in 2018. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain the target information before and during hypoxia exposure. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results A total of 341 trainees participated in this survey and completely filled out the questionnaire. Gastrointestinal tract discomfort caused by the expansion of trapped gas was the main physiological reaction during the previous and current training sessions. Frequently reported symptoms were poor concentration (30.5%), impaired cognitive function (20.5%), visual disturbances (16.4%), hot flashes (15.8%), and paresthesia (12.6%) during both exposures. However, the proportions of participants reporting poor concentration (P = 0.378) and visual disturbances (P = 0.594) were not significantly different between the recalled and current training sessions. The five most common symptoms among the subjects with less than 1,000 flight hours were poor concentration (29.8%), visual disturbance (27.3%), impaired cognitive function (14.9%), dizziness/lightheadedness (11.6%), and hot flashes (9.9%), which overlapped substantially with the symptoms reported by other subjects. The occurrence of those five most common symptoms in the group with more than 1,000 flight hours did not significantly differ between the recalled training session and the current training session. Conclusions The most common hypoxia symptoms reported were similar between the recalled and current training sessions in an environment with a low oxygen concentration. This finding was also clearly affected by the duration of flight experience. Moreover, GI effects of the expansion of trapped gas were commonly observed at low atmospheric pressure. © 2020 Tu et al.

Learning and novel and complex cognitive tasks involving multiple demands, however, might be impaired. This study evaluated whether complex cognition-as assessed by complex reasoning, multiple memory, and risk judgment-was impaired during mild hypoxia. Using a normobaric single-blind crossover design, 25 healthy nonsmoking male participants breathed normoxic (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.206) or hypoxic air (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.143) equivalent to 2,438 m for 2 hr and performed the following tasks at baseline, 30 min, and 90 min: (a) a complex logical reasoning task that assessed accuracy, response time, and a reasoning quality index for easy (nonconflict valid), difficult (nonconflict invalid), fairly difficult (conflict valid), and very difficult (conflict invalid) syllogisms; (b) a multiple memory test that assessed sentence judgment error, working memory span, and prospective memory; and (c) a simple vigilance psychomotor task that assessed the frequency and mean time that a disc was outside a target area and braking reaction time. They also completed a self-perceived risk judgement questionnaire near the end of each exposure. After 90 min, the mean change in working memory span for mild hypoxia (M = 0.9, SD = 4.6) was significantly less than for normoxia (M = 4.4, SD = 7.2). The reasoning quality index for conflict invalid syllogisms for mild hypoxia (M = 0.22, SD = 0.29) was marginally significantly less than for normoxia (M = 0.39, SD = 0.35). The chances of these findings occurring by chance cannot be discounted, but are small. Although this study suggests that mild hypoxia might impair working memory and complex logical reasoning involving difficult conflicts, further studies using more discerning tests of cognition are warranted. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

The aim of this study was to assess inflight pilot workload using both physiological and multidimensional subjective-ratings measurements (heart rate and NASA Task Load Index, respectively), comparing relative sensitivity during the four phases of flight: take-off, cruise, approach, and landing. Methods: Ten male pilots volunteered to participate in the trials, which took place in a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator. Electrocardiography was performed throughout the test using the portable Cardiovis ECG system. Mean heart rate (HR) and incremental heart rate (ΔHR) were considered indices of physiological workload. Results: Peak HR was observed during take-off (83.2 bpm) and landing (88.6 bpm); moreover, ΔHR was also greatest (14.2 bpm and 18.8 bpm). The Task Load Index (TLX) scale revealed that mental and performance demands were essential components of workload during flight. In addition, temporal demand was an important component of workload during take-off and physical demand was significant during cruise. Analysis of correlation revealed that the ΔHR is significantly related to TLX scores (r = 0.81, n = 40). Conclusions: Management of the individual sources of stress, which tend to become predominant during different flight phases, should be emphasized in periodic recurrent training. For example, a pilot must be trained to cope with the increased temporal stresses associated with take-off. In addition, the recommendations will be concerned with maintaining vigilance, task allocation between pilots, and inflight rest during long-haul cruise.</abstract>', '<title>Heart rate variability and performance of commercial airline pilots during flight simulations</title> <abstract>Pilots undergo a variety of stressors that may affect their performance during all phases of flight. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been considered as a reliable indicator of the parasympathetic and sympathetic activities of human autonomic nervous system, which can be used to characterize the sympathetic stress response of pilots during flight. In this study, thirty active commercial airline pilots were recruited to fly three flight segments in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certified A320 flight simulator with each segment at a different carbon dioxide (CO <inf>2</inf> ) concentration on the flight deck. The pilots performed a series of maneuvers of varying difficulty, and their performance was evaluated by FAA designated pilot examiners. The HRV metrics (SDNN, RMSSD and LF/HF ratio) of each pilot both before and during flight simulations were measured with a Movisens EcgMove3 sensor. The average SDNN, RMSSD and LF/HF ratio of the pilots during flight simulations were 34.1 ± 12.7 ms, 23.8 ± 10.2 ms and 5.7 ± 2.8 respectively. Decreased HRV was associated with aging, obesity and performing difficult maneuvers. Both CO <inf>2</inf> exposure and HRV had an independent effect on the pilot performance, while their interaction was not significant. The generalized additive mixed effect model results showed that a pilot performed better on a maneuver when his stress response was lower, as indicated by higher SDNN and RMSSD and lower LF/HF ratio. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in SDNN (21.97 ms) and RMSSD (16.00 ms) and an IQR decrease in LF/HF ratio (4.69) was associated with an increase in the odds of passing a maneuver by 37%, 22% and 20%, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

The study also examined the relations among performance-based, subjective, and psychophysiological measures of operator workload. Seven male volunteers,enrolled in an instrument flight rule (IFR) aviation course at the University of Illinois, participated in the study. The student pilots flew a series of IFR flight missions in a single-engine, fixed-based simulator. In dual-task conditions subjects were also required to discriminate between two tones differing in frequency and to make an occasional overt response. ERPs time-locked to the tones, subjective effort ratings, and overt performance measures were collected during two separate 45-min flights differing in difficulty. The difficult flight was associated with high subjective effort ratings, as well as increased deviations from the command altitude, heading, and glideslope. The P300 component of the ERP discriminated among levels of task difficulty, decreasing in amplitude with increased task demands. Within-flight demands were examined by dividing each flight into four segments: takeoff, straight and level flight, holding patterns, and landings. The amplitude of the P300 was negatively correlated with deviations from command headings across the flight segments. In sum, the findings provide preliminary evidence for the assertion that ERP components can be employed as metrics of resource allocation in complex, real-world environments.; Previous research has indicated that components of the event-related potential (ERP) may be used to quantify the resource requirements of complex cognitive tasks.

The Psychophysiological Reserve Capacity (PRC) is defined as a pilot's ability to accomplish additive tasks without reducing the performance of the primary task (flight task). Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the PRC was a mirror of the pilot's functional state. The purpose of this study was to probe the psychophysiological method for evaluating a pilot's professional reliability on a simulator. Methods: The PRC Comprehensive Evaluating System (PRCCES) which was used in the experiment included four subsystems: a) quantitative evaluation system for pilot's performance on simulator; b) secondary task display and quantitative estimating system; c) multiphysiological data monitoring and statistical system; and d) comprehensive evaluation system for pilot PRC. Two studies were performed. In study one, 63 healthy and 13 hospitalized pilots participated. Each pilot performed a double 180°circuit flight program with and without secondary task (three digit operation). The operator performance, score of secondary task and cost of physiological effort were measured and compared by PRCCES in the two conditions. Then, each pilot's flight skill in training was subjectively scored by instructor pilot ratings. In study two, 7 healthy pilots volunteered to take part in the experiment on the effects of sleep deprivation on pilot's PRC. Each participant had PRC tested pre- and post-8 h sleep deprivation. Results: The results show that the PRC values of a healthy pilot was positively correlated with abilities of flexibility, operating and correcting deviation, attention distribution, and accuracy of instrument flight in the air (r = 0.27-0.40, p<0.05), and negatively correlated with emotional anxiety in flight (r = -0.40, p < 0.05). The values of PRC in healthy pilots (0.61 ± 0.17) were significantly higher than that of hospitalized pilots (0.43 ± 0.15) (p < 0.05). The PRC value after 8 h sleep loss (0.50 P 0.17) was significantly lower than those before sleep loss (0.70 ± 0.15) (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that a pilot's PRC, which was closely related to flight ability and functional state, could partly represent the pilot's professional reliability. It is worthwhile to further research using a pilot's PRC as a predictor of mental workload in aircraft design.</abstract>"", '<title>Role of Multiple Resources in Predicting Time-Sharing Efficiency: Evaluation of Three Workload Models in a Multiple-Task Setting</title> <abstract>The goal of our study was to assess the validity of the assumptions underlying three prominent workload models: the Time-Line Analysis and Prediction workload model (Parks & Boucek, 1989), the VACP workload model (Aldrich, Szabo, & Bierbaum, 1989), and the W/INDEX model (North & Riley, 1989). Sixteen subjects flew a low-fidelity flight simulation. Subjects were required to perform a two-axis tracking task, a concurrent visual-monitoring task, and a discrete decision task. The decision task had 16 variations defined by two levels on each of the following dimensions: input modality (visual vs. auditory), processing code (spatial vs. verbal), difficulty (easy vs. hard), and response modality (manual vs. voice). Dual-task costs were found only for the tracking task. The tracking data were then analyzed using two approaches: a traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a correlational analysis of tracking performance versus model predictions. The ANOVA revealed that performance on the tracking task was better when the concurrent decision task was responded to vocally and was easy. Input modality and processing code of the concurrent decision task had no significant effect on tracking performance. The correlational analysis was used to evaluate each of the three models, to determine what features were responsible for improving the models’ fit, and to compare their performance with a pure time-line model that makes no multiple-resource assumptions. All three models did a good job of predicting variance between experimental conditions, accounting for between 56% and 84% of the variance in our data and between 10% and 40% of an earlier data set. Different features of each model that affect the fit are then discussed. We conclude that it is important for models to retain a multiple-resource coding, although the best features of that coding remain to be determined. Coding tasks by their demand level appears to be less critical. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>']"

Background: Although technology has long been an irreplaceable, valuable ally for airline pilots, artificial intelligence (AI) differs significantly from previously used technologies and pilots perceive AI not only as a tool but as an agent with human-like attributes. These anthropomorphic perceptions shape their career-related attitudes, especially as AI’s cognitive capabilities and ethical limitations challenge pilot identity. Methods: Survey data were collected from 363 commercial pilots and measures included anthropomorphic features ascribed to AI (including sociopathic AI features), perceived career threats and opportunities as well as expected performance enhancement due to AI. Regression and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. Background: Sociopathic AI features were positively associated with career threats and negatively with opportunities. Career opportunities significantly mediated the relationship between sociopathic features and perceived performance gains. Perceived career threats related to AI reduced performance expectations due to AI only when perceived career opportunities were low. Conclusions: The study offers a broad perspective on introducing artificial intelligence into the cockpit, considering commercial pilots' tendency to anthropomorphise AI. It seeks to ensure that AI can deliver operational benefits in safety and performance that meet the industry's and its end-users' needs, therefore addressing ethical concerns is critical for AI integration in aviation. © 2025 The Author(s).

Twenty flight tasks supported by the FMS were analyzed using a cognitive stage model (Sherry, Polson, Feary, & Palmer, 2002) to identify steps with the potential for errors. If a step was found not to have visual cues such as labels or prompts for the required action sequence it was identified as a recall step and a potential source of difficulty. If the action was supported by salient labels and prompts it was identified as a recognition step. Actual pilots using an FMS were observed and performance and errors categorized into the related task step. The greatest amount of observed difficulty was accessing the correct function, labeled as an access error. This process was found to be particularly vulnerable to recall problems. Pilots had the likelihood of .74 for committing an access error on tasks with 2 recalled access steps. This is compared to .13 for 1 recalled access step and .06 for no recalled access steps. Errors associated with formatting, inserting, or verifying entries were less common than access errors; however, these errors primarily occurred on tasks in which recall steps were required for the related step. A total of 93% of the format errors, 80% of the insert errors, and 81% of the verify errors occurred on the tasks that did not have good recognition support for each associated step. On a positive note, experience with the new FMS in the preceding 6 months was correlated with a decrease in overall errors, r(22) = -.42, p < .05, and a decrease in errors associated with inadequate knowledge to accomplish a required step, r(22) =-.61, p <. 01.

We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Pilot Interaction With Cockpit Automation II: An Experimental Study of Pilots’ Model and Awareness of the Flight Management System</title> <abstract>Technological developments have made it possible to automate more and more functions on the commercial aviation flight deck and in other dynamic high-consequence domains. This increase in the degrees of freedom in design has shifted questions away from narrow technological feasibility. Many concerned groups, from designers and operators to regulators and researchers, have begun to ask questions about how we should use the possibilities afforded by technology skillfully to support and expand human performance. In this article, we report on an experimental study that addressed these questions by examining pilot interaction with the current generation of flight deck automation. Previous results on pilot-automation interaction derived from pilot surveys, incident reports, and training observations have produced a corpus of features and contexts in which human-machine coordination is likely to break down (e.g., automation surprises). We used these data to design a simulated flight scenario that contained a variety of probes designed to reveal pilots’ mental model of one major component of flight deck automation: the Flight Management System (FMS). The events within the scenario were also designed to probe pilots’ ability to apply their knowledge and understanding in specific flight contexts and to examine their ability to track the status and behavior of the automated system (mode awareness). Although pilots were able to “make the system work” in standard situations, the results reveal a variety of latent problems in pilot-FMS interaction that can affect pilot performance in nonnormal time critical situations. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The objective was to understand fully autonomous aircraft’s influence on commercial pilots, as well as investigate the effects on the U.S. airline industry and human-machine interaction. Commercial airline pilots, including ranks of both Captains and First Officers (FO) in Part 121 scheduled service, were the research population for this study. The sample population number was 15 U.S. airline pilots offering various diversity in age, gender, years of service, airline employer, and military or civilian flight experience. The semi-structured qualitative research consisted of developing a deeper understanding of the pilots’ perceptions of the three-pronged approach: (1) the psychological barriers and motives of the pilot, (2) the differences in aircraft ground-based safety and training, and (3) pilots’ understanding of the timeliness of entry for unmanned flight deck operations to reach FAA standards. The study consisted of participant interviews utilizing a series of ten structured and semi-structured interview questions. The findings concluded that pilots are aware of the workload changes that are present with implementing fully autonomous aircraft in the Part 121 category. Two themes became evident when discussing workload changes. First, the role of the pilot changes from a single flight focus to a multi-flight monitor. Secondly, as technology advances, the pilot’s physical workload of hand flying an aircraft will constantly deteriorate. Furthermore, the advancement of a fully automated flight deck and its effects on the U.S. airline industry can potentially have significant impacts on the psychology of commercial airline pilots. While pilot responses varied based on individual experiences, attitudes, and adaptability, there were several psychological responses identified in this study, including (1) loss of control, (2) uncertainty toward technology, (3) job insecurity, and (4) adaptability. Last, the advancement of a fully autonomous flight deck will obviously create additional concerns for U.S. airline passengers. The most significant concerns for passengers included (1) safety, (2) trust, (3) passenger-pilot relationship, and (4) understanding of technology. Passengers will always question if modern technology has been thoroughly evaluated and if it can react to unexpected situations as safely and effectively as a human. © 2023, University Aviation Association.

First, the concept of “risky pilots” is discussed, and the existence of “risky pilots” is verified using a percentage analysis of flight exceedance events. Second, three psychological risk elements for pilots are investigated using an implementation of psychological scales, and the exceedance behaviors of risky pilots are analyzed based on real flight data. Finally, correlation and cluster analyses are used to study the influence of psychological risk elements on the exceedance behaviors of airline transport pilots and their operational performance. The results indicate that approximately one-third of pilots are more prone to exceedance events than other pilots. A moderate positive linear correlation (R [44] = 0.400; p <.05) existed between hazardous attitudes and severe exceedance rates. For pilots with a high level of risk psychology, 86% of their flights were considered “poor” operational performance level. Finally, it is concluded that hazardous attitude is a psychological risk element that has significant negative effects on severe exceedance behaviors of pilots. In addition, the flight operation performance levels of pilots were also affected by the psychological risk level. Furthermore, it is suggested that special training to improve risky hazardous attitudes of pilots should be conducted for the purpose of reducing exceedance behaviors and improving flight performance.

Indeed, risk attitudes have been considered as a risk factor for aviation accidents. In this context, emotions and coping style are key variables which could influence concentration by affecting cognition and attention. In addition, the specific training backgrounds seemed to be associated with differences in in-flight accident rates. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between age, sex, flight experience, emotional dysregulation, coping styles, flight licenses, and pilots’ risk attitudes. Methods: Eighty pilots completed an online survey composed of ad hoc questionnaire for sociodemographic and work-related information’s and self-report questionnaires that assessed emotional dysregulation, coping styles, and risk attitudes. Results: Results showed that older age and emotional dysregulation were associated with higher risk attitudes in pilots. Moreover, emotional dysregulation seemed to promote worse self-confidence. Ultralight pilots appeared to be more risk-oriented and less self-confident than civil pilots, while more flight experience appeared to favorite greater self-confidence. Discussion: In conclusion, the study suggests the importance of promoting interventions based on sharing pilots’ difficulties and emotions and promoting safe attitudes with special attention to ultralight pilots, age, and sex differences. © © 2022 Luciani, Veneziani, Ciacchella, Rocchi, Reho, Gennaro and Lai.</abstract>', '<title>Predicting pilots risk-taking behavior through an implicit association test</title> <abstract>Objective: The Implicit Association Test (IAT), in combination with a battery of additional psychometric tests, was employed to examine the accuracy with which it predicts pilots risk-taking behavior. Background: Risk management is an integral part of piloting. Many factors affect pilots risk management, including individual differences. Therefore, employing a unique methodology from social cognition, the present study examined the influence of attitude, as measured implicitly through the IAT, personality, and flight experience variables on pilots risk-taking behavior. Method: In addition to a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator, 35 pilots completed a battery of psychometric tests. Results: Among the 6 risk perception variables, 10 risk attitude variables, and 2 experience variables, only 2 variables were found to be significantly related with in-flight risk-taking behavior: everyday risk (risk perception) and the IAT effect (attitude). Of these, the IAT effect was the strongest predictor of flight behavior. Conclusion: The results indicate that implicit attitudinal measures, such as the IAT, provide a more accurate forecast of pilot behavior than do the more traditional explicit attitudinal or personality measures. Application: An implicit attitudinal measure can be proactively employed to identify pilots who are potentially more likely to engage in high-risk activities, hence permitting a more strategic approach to pilot training. © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>', '<title>The Link between Individual Predictors of Risk and Risky Flight Behavior: A Systematic Review</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to highlight how pilots’ risk perception is measured, and the relationship between individual predictors of risk and risky flight behavior. Background: Risk is an intrinsic part of life with no action void of risk. Risk-taking is mediated by several factors which include age, sex, cultural background, and personality. Understanding how pilots’ risk perception is measured allows for improved understanding of pilots’ propensity to engage in risk, and for the design of training initiatives to mitigate risky behavior. Method: A systematic review was conducted to establish the link between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior. The systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines, covering the time span between 1985 and 2021. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were revealed. Results: Three of the 16 articles employed an in-situ behavioral measure for risky flight behavior. Forecasting, where an individual predicts his/her action in a particular circumstance was the most used measure to deduce pilots’ risk-taking behavior. No predictor variable reliably predicted pilots’ risky flight behavior. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the majority of research examining the relationship between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior relies on self-reported measures or scales as opposed to in-situ performance measures such as data captured during flight or in a simulator. Such performance measures are susceptible to demand characteristics. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Cognitive and Emotional Impacts of Face Pareidolia Application Among Pilot Students</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Metaphoric signs, which refer to a resemblance to something absent, are, like pareidolia, strong cognitive tools that help us understand abstract concepts by relating them to concrete, sensory experiences, and these have not been studied in student pilots. Evaluating the characteristics of students in aviation, including sensory experiences such as stress, decision-making, and pattern recognition, is important for safe flight. This study aims to investigate the cognitive and emotional impacts of face pareidolia among pilot students by using the digital Pareidolia Test (PT). METHODS: Subjects were 86 students from the Professional Pilot B.Sc. PROGRAM: PT includes 10 face and 10 pareidolia images. The number of European Aviation Safety Agency flight and simulator training hours, stress levels, and perceiving emotion in the pareidolia and face images were assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to test normality, and the Chi-squared test was used to analyze differences. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences in perceiving emotion in facial images based on stress levels from flight training from faculty courses (N = 42/86, 49.9%), and perceiving faces in pareidolia images related to flight simulator training hours. Perceiving emotions in pareidolia images varied significantly based on the number of European Aviation Safety Agency tests, but perceiving faces on pareidolia images did not show significant differences. DISCUSSION: We claim that incorporating pareidolia in aviation training enhances pilots' pattern recognition abilities, facilitating more accurate decision-making. The research recommends using the new digital PT in professions that require attention, such as pilots, to evaluate these parameters. Akdeniz G, Yilmaz HE, Geza H.

The mission phases include powered flight, free flight, space maneuvers, atmospheric entry, terminal phase, and surface operation. The stresses of the space environment are caused by forces and or motions or lack thereof, the space environment itself, the nature of the environment within the spacecraft, and the mental and physical demands on the flight crew. Among crew functions are control of the onboard systems, navigation and guidance of the spacecraft, maintenance and emergency operation, communications, and the conduct of scientific experiments. The paper draws on information obtained from the flight research to date as well as from ground tests and analyses. From the results one can conclude that man can very ably withstand the stresses of short duration missions into near space and has demonstrated ability to perform the type of tasks associated with flight crew operation. The chief unknown factors of future flight operations are the stresses produced by longer duration missions. Consideration of the problems involved leads to the conclusion that they are amenable to engineering solution at some expense to spacecraft weight and performance. It appears desirable therefore to utilize the flight crew to a high degree in future missions in the type of tasks where human judgment is needed or where significant simplification of on-board equipment may result.</abstract>"", '<title>Summary of research issues in personal, interpersonal, and group dynamics</title> <abstract>People working on space missions, whether they are crewmembers or Mission Control personnel, must interact in groups. Consequently, it is important to consider interpersonal and group dynamic issues to assure that mission goals are accomplished. Simulation studies on Earth and anecdotal reports from space have described a number of such issues that include crew heterogeneity, culture and language variations, leadership roles, and personality differences. Problems that can result include increased group tension, decreased cohesion, subgrouping, scapegoating, miscommunication, role confusion, and displacement of tension and dysphoria from one group to another. The three papers by Drs. Caldwell, Kanas, and Stuster that are presented in this session address some of these issues at the group level. They suggest three critical questions related to: 1) improving communication between space crews and Mission Control personnel; 2) dealing with emotional and interpersonal decrements during the second half of space missions; and 3) minimizing the effects of culture and language differences. These questions in turn lead to six research strategies related to: 1) developing and testing new technologies to enhance crew-ground communication; 2) developing tools to recognize important communication themes and the factors that affect them over time; 3) studying the ability of voice analysis technology to detect on-board interpersonal stress; 4) developing and testing countermeasures to deal with second half emotional and interpersonal decrements; 5) studying the effects of cultural and language differences on crew tension, cohesion, and performance; and 6) studying the effects of crew heterogeneity and size on crew tension, cohesion, and performance.</abstract>', '<title>Applications of methods of psychological support developed for astronauts for use in medical settings</title> <abstract>Over the past 40\xa0years, psychological support (PS) for cosmonauts and astronauts has remained an important part of the regular biomedical provision of space crews during extended orbital flights. It includes well-developed principles and a set of methods that have proven its effectiveness for the maintenance of behavioral health under extreme conditions of space flight. The main principle of PS in flight is to restore the usual sensory input to compensate for the monotony and lack of external stimuli as a result of a long stay under isolation and confinement. Risk factors for the psychological health and well-being defined for the astronauts, such as sensory and social deprivation, monotony, confinement, and lack of privacy, also remain part and parcel of several civil professions. These include polar wintering, submarines, working on oil platforms, and ocean fishing. Most of these factors also adversely affect the recovery rate of a large contingent of medical institutions, especially bedridden patients with chronic diseases. Finally, due to the negative epidemiological situation associated with the spread of COVID-19, an increasingly wide range of citizens forced to be in self-isolation faces negative manifestations of the deprivation phenomena described previously. Several cases of successful use of PS under isolation, monotony, crowding, and confinement are presented.

Although many authors have noted that meaningful work may be beneficial for astronauts on these missions, none have detailed the sources of meaningful work for astronauts and how these sources may differ between astronauts. The present article identifies how engagement in meaningful work during long duration missions may mitigate the adverse effects of demands and increase the potential for benefits resulting from the missions. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine NASA personnel, including astronauts, flight directors, and flight surgeons. Questions addressed sources of meaning for astronauts, characteristics of tasks that enhance vs. detract from meaning, and recommendations for enhancing meaning. RESULTS: Personnel mentioned contributing to humanity and the next generation, contributing to the mission, and exploration as the most meaningful aspects of their work. Characteristics of tasks that enhanced meaning included using a variety of skills, feeling personal control over their schedule, autonomy in the execution of tasks, and understanding the importance of the experiments conducted on the mission. Top recommendations to sustain meaning were insuring social needs were met through such activities as the strategic use of social media, giving astronauts autonomy as well as structure, and conducting training during transit.

Background: Currently, problems exist with a myriad of native language accents and phraseology interfering with cognitive reflexes especially for aircrews and air traffic controllers to safely do their work. Executives from four Brazilian airlines proactively implemented a 14-month LDP focused on English language fluency and leadership enhancements collectively for leaders within their firms. Method: Blended learning as proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization provided the experiential and heuristic framework of the LDP suitable for an empirical analysis of participants’ language and leadership improvements. Results: Research outcomes indicated Interaction Ritual Theory and Social Contagion Theory moderating entrained behaviors, emotions, and modes of LDP participants, upskilling their English language fluency and leadership competencies. LDP participants with no prior relationships progressed through the LDP wholly as a collective group prioritizing their language and leadership proficiencies.

Method: This was a single-subject changing criterion design with six participants. Three target vowels and one control vowel were selected for each participant. Mono and bi-syllabic target words were selected from aviation textbooks recommended by the flight academy. Visual feedback and placement cues were provided to assist with each participant’s vowel productions. The Pierson Aviation English Questionnaire (PAEQ), a pre- and post-measure, was also administered. Results: All participants demonstrated gains in PVC at the three levels of difficulty. Participants reported decreased anxiety levels when speaking with native speakers, air traffic controllers, and flight instructors. All pilot candidates reported increased self-confidence levels when using aviation phraseology and an increase in enjoyment when speaking English.

Background: Aviation accident reports often cite miscommunication as a contributing factor. Anecdotal reports from pilots, along with limited empirical studies on pilot communication, further confirm that miscommunication remains a problem. Method: Approximately 250 ATC-Pilot transmissions from each of four international airports: Kingsford Smith, Sydney, Australia (YSSY); Hong Kong International Airport (VHHH); Los Angeles International Airport, USA (KLAX); and Haneda, Tokyo, Japan (RJTT) were analyzed. Pilot communication errors were compared between the four locations based on pilot and ATC accent alignment, rate of speech, number and order of items in transmission, and politeness markers. Results: Native English-sounding pilots committed more errors than accented pilots. Alignment of pilot and ATC language background reduced communication errors, but not when native English speakers were involved. Longer messages increased the number of communication errors. Politeness markers did not affect communication and pilots committed fewer errors when the readback order was not scrambled. Conclusion: Communication errors still occur in ATC-Pilot radio communication. These errors appear more common with native English sounding pilots than accented pilots. Hence, the origin of the problem appears to stem from proficiency in the lingua franca of Aviation English, rather than with the English language. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Construction of leadership competency model for civil aviation flight cadets: An empirical study from China</title> <abstract>Human factors are often linked to unsafe events in civil aviation transport, with the competency level and decision-making abilities of flight crews playing a significant role.

This study aims to explore the key components of leadership and the competency model for civil aviation flight cadets. Based on classic leadership theories and leadership development theories, the research adopts a qualitative analysis using grounded theory and utilizes Nvivo 11.0 software for data analysis. An initial leadership evaluation index system for flight cadets was developed. Through a survey of 319 civil aviation pilots and using SPSS 26.0 software for data processing, an evaluation index system was established, covering 4 dimensions—core values, leader competency, outstanding thinking, and positive behavior—with 22 indicators. The study also applied AMOS 24.0 software to conduct validation factor analysis and path analysis and construct the BLVT model of leadership development for civil aviation flight cadets. The findings indicate that, within the 4 dimensions of leadership and the BLVT model, core values influence positive behavior through leader competency and outstanding thinking, resulting in appropriate performance by flight cadets. Outstanding thinking directly affects leader competency, thereby driving the leadership development of flight cadets, who form the development of their leadership skills by recognizing their leadership competencies.

Methods: In our recently completed NASA-funded study of 5 U.S. astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 U.S. and 16 Russian mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir program, we evaluated a number of important psychosocial issues such as group tension, cohesion, leadership role, and the displacement of negative emotions from crewmembers to people in mission control and from mission control personnel to management. Results: Based on our findings, which are reviewed, a number of psychosocial countermeasures are suggested to help ameliorate the negative impact of potential psychosocial problems during future manned space missions. Conclusions: Crewmembers should be selected not only to rule out psychopathology but also to select-in for group compatibility and facility in a common language. Training should include briefings and team building related to a number of psychosocial issues and should involve both crewmembers and mission control personnel. During the mission, both experts on the ground and the crewmembers themselves should be alert to potential interpersonal problems, including the displacement of negative emotions from the crew to the ground. Supportive activities should consist of both individual and interpersonal strategies, including an awareness of changing leisure time needs. Finally, attention should be given to post-mission readjustment and to supporting the families on Earth.</abstract>', '<title>Crewmember and ground personnel interactions over time during Shuttle/Mir space missions</title> <abstract>Background: Anecdotal reports from space and results from simulation studies on Earth have suggested that space crewmembers may experience decrements in their mood and interpersonal environment during the 2nd hall of the mission and that negative emotions may be displaced to outside monitoring personnel. Methods: To evaluate these issues, we studied 5 American astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 American and 16 Russian mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir space program. Subjects completed questions from the Profile of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale (GES), and the Work Environment Scale (WES) on a weekly basis during the missions. Subscale scores from these measures were analyzed using a piecewise linear regression approach that analyzed normally distributed subscales using a mixed model and non-normally distributed subscales by dichotomizing the variables and using a generalized estimating equation. Results: After protecting against possible Type I errors due to multiple significance tests, only weak support was found for the biphasic model: the only significant findings in favor of the hypothesized 2nd hall decrements in the interpersonal environment were in crewmember GES Leader Support and astronaut WES Work Pressure. Strongly consistent confirmation was found on all six tested measures for the hypothesized displacement of tension and dysphoria from crewmembers to mission control personnel. The hypothesized displacement of tension and dysphoria from mission control personnel to management was found on five of the six tested measures. Conclusions: The absence of moderate to strong support for the biphasic model suggests that crewmember interpersonal functioning does not depend appreciably on 1st half/2nd hall time effects. The consistent support found for the displacement of tension and dysphoria suggests that countermeasures need to be developed to deal with this phenomenon in both crewmembers and mission control personnel.</abstract>', '<title>Crewmember interactions during a Mir space station simulation</title> <abstract>Background: Interpersonal problems may negatively affect crews on long- duration space missions. These problems stem from crewmember tension and its displacement to the outside monitoring personnel, and from disruptions in crew cohesion and unclear leadership roles. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that crew tension and dysphoria would transiently increase following stressful events and be greater in the second half of a mission; that cohesion would be less during the second half of a mission; that tension and dysphoria would be displaced to the outside monitoring personnel; and that high levels of leader support and control would produce high levels of cohesion. Methods: We tested these hypotheses during a 135-d Mir space station simulation study in Moscow. At weekly intervals, the three crewmembers completed items from two group climate questionnaires, a mood questionnaire, and a log of stressful events. Results: Contrary to expectations, there was significantly (p < 0.05) more total mood disturbance and tension during the first 9 wks than during the subsequent 10 wks of the simulation. Although levels of cohesion remained the same over lime, cohesion scores dropped at a significantly greater rate during the last third of the seclusion. There was evidence for the displacement of tension and dysphoria to the outside monitoring personnel. There were significant correlations in the predicted direction between leader support and control and crew cohesion, as well as evidence of status leveling in the mission commander. Conclusions: Crewmember tension, cohesion, and leadership are important issues affecting people working in secluded environments, and they need to be studied further in space.</abstract>', '<title>Psychosocial issues in space: results from Shuttle/Mir.</title> <abstract>Important psychosocial issues involving tension, cohesion, leader support, and displacement of negative emotions were evaluated in a 4 1/2-year study involving five U.S. and four Russian Shuttle/Mir space missions. Weekly mood and group climate questionnaires were completed by five U.S. astronauts, eight Russian cosmonauts, and 42 U.S. and 16 Russian mission control subjects. There were few findings that supported our hypothesized changes in tension, cohesion, and leader support in crew and ground subjects using various time models, although crewmembers reported decreasing leader support in the 2nd half of the missions, and astronauts showed some evidence of a novelty effect in the first few weeks. There was no evidence suggesting a 3rd quarter effect among crewmembers on any of the 21 subscales evaluated. In contrast, there was strong evidence to support the hypothesized displacement of tension and negative emotions from crewmembers to mission control personnel and from mission control personnel to management. There were several significant differences in response between Americans vs. Russians, crewmembers vs. mission control personnel, and subjects in this study vs. people in comparable groups on Earth. Subject responses before, during, and after the missions were similar, and we did not find evidence for asthenia in space. Critical incidents that were reported generally dealt with events on-board the Mir and interpersonal conflicts, although most of the responses were from a relatively small number of subjects. Our findings have implications for future training and lead to a number of countermeasures.</abstract>', '<title>Crewmember and mission control personnel interactions during international space station missions</title> <abstract>Introduction: Reports from astronauts and cosmonauts, studies from space analogue environments on Earth, and our previous research on the Mir Space Station have identified a number of psychosocial issues that can lead to problems during long-duration space missions. Three of these issues (time effects, displacement, leader role) were studied during a series of long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Methods: As in our previous Mir study, mood and group climate questions from the Profile of Mood States or POMS, the Group Environment Scale or GES, and the Work Environment Scale or WES were completed weekly by 17 ISS crewmembers (15 men, 2 women) in space and 128 American and Russian personnel in mission control. Results: The results did not support the presence of decrements in mood and group cohesion during the 2nd half of the missions or in any specific quarter. The results did support the predicted displacement of negative feelings to outside supervisors in both crew and mission control subjects on all six questionnaire subscales tested. Crewmembers related cohesion in their group to the support role of their commander. For mission control personnel, greater cohesion was linked to the support role as well as to the task role of their leader. Discussion: The findings from our previous study on the Mir Space Station were essentially replicated on board the ISS. The findings suggest a number of countermeasures for future on-orbit missions, some of which may not be relevant for expeditionary missions (e.g., to Mars).

In most cases, human factors are not working alone, instead they are coupled with complex environment, mechanical factors, physiological and psychological factors of pilots, and organizational management, all of which form a complex aviation safety system. It is vital to investigate the coupling impact of human errors to avoid the occurrence of aviation accidents. In view that the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) provides a hierarchical classification principle of human errors in aviation accidents, and the System Dynamics (SD) approach is helpful to describe the risk evolution process, this paper establishes a hybrid HFACS-SD model by employing the HFACS and the SD approach to reveal the aviation human factors risk evolution mechanism, in which the HFACS is first used to capture the causal factors of human errors risk, and a coupling SD model is then built to describe the evolution of aviation human factors risk supported by historical data. The eigenvalue elasticity analysis is taken to identify critical loops and parameters that have a substantial impact on the system structural behavior, and the influence of parameters and loops is assessed. Simulation results show that the evolution trend of the accident rate can be replicated by the proposed HFACS-SD model, and the structural dominance analysis can efficiently identify critical loops and parameters. Simulation results further show that, with the recommended safety enhancement measures, the stability of the aviation system is increased, and thus lowering the overall accident rate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Exploring the intellectual insights in aviation safety research: A systematic literature and bibliometric review</title> <abstract>Research in aviation safety has led to significant advancements in the aviation industry.

With system approach in management and strategy, human risk factor as input has considerable potential to change results as airworthiness in aviation management. The managers of aviation business also optimize their functions to act safe while making contribution to development in triple of sustainability as economic development and its sustainability; social development and its sustainability; and environmental development and its sustainability. Corporate sustainability can be accomplished via supporting workforce which is the human risk factor. To support (empowerment) workforce, researchers should identify human risk or error factors which are important to this research. The purpose of this study is to suggest holistic framework for working environment system of aircraft maintenance technicians (AMTs) within two respects such as human performance (ergonomics) and corporate performance (sustainability). The secondary purpose of this system is to develop human risk taxonomy by determining the factors affecting both human and work by taking ergonomic aspects in aviation. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a taxonomy of human risk factors for AMTs is developed. These human factors divided into groups and subfactors are obtained from an extensive literature review and experts’ opinions in the field of human performance in aviation. Taxonomy developed will be useful to both sharing and using corporate sources in sustainable way. Findings: Human risk factors can be considered or accepted as factors that cause human error. This may result in the optimum way to managing human risk factor via minimizing human-based error. Personality, hazardous attitudes, individual characteristics, physical/psychological condition of AMTs and corporate social responsibility factors are human-related risk variables in this study. The risks and error can be reduced by recognizing these factors and revealing their relation to ergonomic design. Originality/value: The results of this study are intended to constitute a guide for managers to manage risk factors and to take corrective and preventive actions for their maintenance operations. It is believed that this study is highly important for the aviation sector in terms of raising awareness or providing awareness for similar practices. As taxonomy of the risk factors contributes to the managing human error, corrective actions related to these factors must be taken by managers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>Strategic approach to managing human factors risk in aircraft maintenance organization: risk mapping</title> <abstract>Purpose: Aviation has multi-cultural business environment in all aspects as operational and management. Managing aviation requires high awareness on human factor risk which includes organizational behavior-related topics. The greatest risk to an enterprise’s ability to achieve its strategic goals and objectives is the human factor. Both organizational behavior and corporate culture behavior with social psychology are the most vital aspects of management and strategy in terms of human resources. Related risks, including organizational behavior and culture, have the potential to directly impact on both business performance and corporate sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, the most prominent risks were determined in accordance with social psychology, and after identification of human factor-based risks, these have prioritized and prepared risk mapping with fresh approach. For this reason, this study aims to develop risk mapping model for human factors that takes into account interrelations among risk factors three dimensional based new approach. This approach includes both identification of human factor based risks, prioritization them and setting risk mapping according to corporate based qualifications via tailoring risk list. Developed risk map in this paper will help to manage corporate risks to achieve improved performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This new organizational behavior- and culture-focused risk mapping model developed in this study has the potential to make significant contribution to the management of the human factor for modern management and strategy. In enterprise risk management system, risk mapping is both strong and effective strategic methodology to manage ergonomics issue with strategic approach. Human factor is both determinative and also strategic element to both continuity and performance of business operations with safely and sound. In view of management and strategy, vitally, the human factor determines the outcome in both every business and every decision-making. Findings: It is assumed that, if managers manage human risk you may get advantages to achieving corporate strategies in timely manner. Aviation is sensitive sector for its ingredients: airports, airlines, air traffic management, aircraft maintenance, pilotage and ground handling. Aim of this paper is to present risk management approach to optimize human performance while minimizing both failures and errors by aircraft maintenance technician (AMT). This model may apply all human factors in other departments of aviation such as pilots and traffic controllers. AMT is key component of aircraft maintenance. Thus, errors made by AMTs will cause aircraft accidents or incidents or near miss incidents. In this study, new taxonomy model for human risk factors in aircraft maintenance organizations has been designed, and also new qualitative risk assessment as three dimensions is carried out by considering the factors affecting the AMT’s error obtained from extensive literature review and expert opinions in the field of aviation. Human error risks are first categorized into two main groups and sub three groups and then prioritized using the risk matrix via triple dimension as probability, severity and interrelations ratio between risks. Practical implications: Risk mapping is established to decide which risk management option they will apply for managers when they will look at this map. Managers may use risk map to both identify their managerial priorities and share sources to managing risks, and make decisions on risk handling options. This new model may be a useful new tool to manage ergonomic human factor-based risks in developing strategy in aviation business management. In addition, this paper will contribute to department of management and strategy and related literature. Originality/value: This study has originality via new modeling of risk matrix. In this study, dimension of risk analysis has been improved as three dimensions. This study has new approach and new assessment of risk with likelihood (probability), impact (severity) and interrelations ratio. This new model may be a useful new tool to both assess and prioritize mapping of ergonomic-based risks in business management. In addition, this research will contribute to aviation management and strategy literature and also enterprise risk management literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', ""<title>An integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach to analyze human factors in aviation accidents</title> <abstract>Human factors are critical causes of modern aviation accidents. However, existing accident analysis methods encounter limitations in addressing aviation human factors, especially in complex accident scenarios. The existing graphic approaches are effective for describing accident mechanisms within various categories of human factors, but cannot simultaneously describe inadequate human-aircraft-environment interactions and organizational deficiencies effectively, and highly depend on analysts' skills and experiences. Moreover, the existing methods do not emphasize latent unsafe factors outside accidents. This paper focuses on the above three limitations and proposes an integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach. A new graphic model named accident tree (AcciTree), with a two-mode structure and a reaction-based concept, is developed for accident modeling and safety defense identification. The AcciTree model is then integrated with the well-established human factors analysis and classification system (HFACS) to enhance both reliability of the graphic part and logicality of the taxonomic part for improving completeness of analysis. An associative hazard analysis technique is further put forward to extend analysis to factors outside accidents, to form extended safety requirements for proactive accident prevention. Two crash examples, a research flight demonstrator by our team and an industrial unmanned aircraft, illustrate that the integrated approach is effective for identifying more unsafe factors and safety requirements. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.</abstract>""]"

This includes assessing the risks and benefits that a complicated medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) poses to the injured crewmember, the crew, and the mission. This qualitative study identifies common MEDEVAC risk assessment principles used in spaceflight and other extreme environments to better inform future risk assessment tools and exploration mission concepts. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with subject matter experts in spaceflight and analog domains, including polar operations, undersea operations, combat medicine, and mountaineering. Transcripts were analyzed using the qualitative method of Thematic Analysis with the technique of consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison. RESULTS: Subject matter experts described 18 themes divided into two main categories: Primary Risk Considerations (e.g., crew, mission, resources, time) and Contributing Factors (e.g., psychological considerations, medical preparation, politics). DISCUSSION: Primary Risk Considerations can assess MEDEVAC risk across mission phases, with Contributing Factors acting as premission tools to adjust those risks. Inter-and intracategory connections identified medical support considerations, MEDEVAC support considerations, and philosophy as the most impactful Contributing Factors. Medical support considerations, psychological considerations, and political considerations were found to have unique aspects given the distances and societal impact of exploration vs. low Earth orbit spaceflight. The Contributing Factor theme of decision making was determined to be unique due to its impacts across both categories.

Focusing on risk mitigation, NASA conducted investigations that addressed spaceflight health hazards to varying degrees. This pilot mission was initiated to gain further knowledge and monitor the physiological, psychological, and medical effects of long-duration exposure to spaceflight. METHODS: NASA's Human Research Program and the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Biomedical Problems identified more than 20 biomedical risk-reduction research investigations to be conducted on the two crewmembers before, during, and after their yearlong expedition. A database of results, as well as observations on programmatic resources, was collected to understand essential elements for future spaceflight health studies. RESULTS: Statistical rigor requires additional testing at a length of 1 yr to demonstrate the presence or absence of unacceptable deleterious effects, and to permit extrapolation to longer durations in space. Review of experimental procedures from this mission suggests potential efficiencies for future investigations. DISCUSSION: The Kelly-Kornienko 1-yr mission demonstrated the importance of continuing joint investigations with the adoption of standard measures for rigorous comparisons across disparate populations. It identified improvements to collaborative processes across national and international scientific research programs. Additional studies will inform the development of an integrated applied research methodology for the space station and future interplanetary expeditions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", ""<title>Radiation environment at aviation altitudes and in space</title> <abstract>On the Earth, protection from cosmic radiation is provided by the magnetosphere and the atmosphere, but the radiation exposure increases with increasing altitude. Aircrew and especially space crew members are therefore exposed to an increased level of ionising radiation. Dosimetry onboard aircraft and spacecraft is however complicated by the presence of neutrons and high linear energy transfer particles. Film and thermoluminescent dosimeters, routinely used for ground-based personnel, do not reliably cover the range of particle types and energies found in cosmic radiation. Further, the radiation field onboard aircraft and spacecraft is not constant; its intensity and composition change mainly with altitude, geomagnetic position and solar activity (marginally also with the aircraft/spacecraft type, number of people aboard, amount of fuel etc.). The European Union Council directive 96/29/Euroatom of 1996 specifies that aircrews that could receive dose of > 1 mSv y-1 must be evaluated. The dose evaluation is routinely performed by computer programs, e.g. CARI-6, EPCARD, SIEVERT, PCAire, JISCARD and AVIDOS. Such calculations should however be carefully verified and validated. Measurements of the radiation field in aircraft are thus of a great importance. A promising option is the long-term deployment of active detectors, e.g. silicon spectrometer Liulin, TEPC Hawk and pixel detector Timepix. Outside the Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetosphere, the environment is much harsher than at aviation altitudes. In addition to the exposure to high energetic ionising cosmic radiation, there are microgravity, lack of atmosphere, psychological and psychosocial components etc. The milieu is therefore very unfriendly for any living organism. In case of solar flares, exposures of spacecraft crews may even be lethal. In this paper, long-term measurements of the radiation environment onboard Czech aircraft performed with the Liulin since 2001, as well as measurements and simulations of dose rates on and outside the International Space Station were presented. The measured and simulated results are discussed in the context of health impact. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

Heart rates tend to stabilize at lower levels in zero gravity and electrical activity, except for occasional bigeminis and premature auricular and ventricular contractions (Apollo 15), is normal. Postflight, cardiac silhouette size is decreased. Reduced orthostatic tolerance is consistently found. Slight loss of bone mass has been observed as has decreased leg size and, in the 2 week Gemini flight, slightly negative nitrogen balance. Electrolyte changes parallel the time course of body weight loss and gain. Hormone changes are consistent with electrolyte changes. Growth of 'opportunistic' organisms is favored, with a resistance to antibiotics demonstrated by some. The number and distribution of microorganisms also change. Vestibular problems are minimal: adaptation appears to occur rapidly. Countermeasures to zero g effects are being explored. The use of lower body negative pressure is under investigation as a means of delaying, reducing, or preventing redistribution of the circulating blood volume in zero g. The use of medications is under investigation for, for example, cardiovascular and anti radiation protection. Vestibular preadaptation programs are being considered, particularly for non test pilot space travelers. In future, longer duration space flights, psychological variables may become increasingly significant. The effects of isolation, estrangement, and reduced privacy on crew stability are being studied. Crew composition is being reassessed with a view toward including female crew members. Improved sleeping accommodations, entertainment facilities, and food will be provided. Waste management and personal hygiene facilities, while still 'basic' by earth based standards, are being steadily improved. In the opinion of the author, 6 months of biomedical, psychological, and human factors data of the type that the Skylab program will begin to collect will be sufficient basis for predicting man's safe commitment to a Mars mission with appropriate understanding of the range of adaptational changes and use of countermeasures where they are found necessary.</abstract>"", '<title>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during spaceflight - a guideline for CPR in microgravity from the German Society of Aerospace Medicine (DGLRM) and the European Society of Aerospace Medicine Space Medicine Group (ESAM-SMG)</title> <abstract>Background: With the “Artemis”-mission mankind will return to the Moon by 2024. Prolonged periods in space will not only present physical and psychological challenges to the astronauts, but also pose risks concerning the medical treatment capabilities of the crew. So far, no guideline exists for the treatment of severe medical emergencies in microgravity. We, as a international group of researchers related to the field of aerospace medicine and critical care, took on the challenge and developed a an evidence-based guideline for the arguably most severe medical emergency – cardiac arrest. Methods: After the creation of said international group, PICO questions regarding the topic cardiopulmonary resuscitation in microgravity were developed to guide the systematic literature research. Afterwards a precise search strategy was compiled which was then applied to “MEDLINE”. Four thousand one hundred sixty-five findings were retrieved and consecutively screened by at least 2 reviewers. This led to 88 original publications that were acquired in full-text version and then critically appraised using the GRADE methodology. Those studies formed to basis for the guideline recommendations that were designed by at least 2 experts on the given field. Afterwards those recommendations were subject to a consensus finding process according to the DELPHI-methodology. Results: We recommend a differentiated approach to CPR in microgravity with a division into basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) similar to the Earth-based guidelines. In immediate BLS, the chest compression method of choice is the Evetts-Russomano method (ER), whereas in an ALS scenario, with the patient being restrained on the Crew Medical Restraint System, the handstand method (HS) should be applied. Airway management should only be performed if at least two rescuers are present and the patient has been restrained. A supraglottic airway device should be used for airway management where crew members untrained in tracheal intubation (TI) are involved. Discussion: CPR in microgravity is feasible and should be applied according to the Earth-based guidelines of the AHA/ERC in relation to fundamental statements, like urgent recognition and action, focus on high-quality chest compressions, compression depth and compression-ventilation ratio. However, the special circumstances presented by microgravity and spaceflight must be considered concerning central points such as rescuer position and methods for the performance of chest compressions, airway management and defibrillation. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract>']"

Four seminal issues that threaten the interpretation of the results of ability studies are introduced and examined. A brief history of the use of g in pilot selection is presented, going back to the World War I era. At that time, many countries used tests such as perception and reaction time, later shown to be mostly measures of g. The World War II era brought the age of the multiple aptitude batteries, and with it, the theory of differential abilities. However, most militaries still used highly g-saturated measures. More recently, an awareness of the prominence of g in job performance has led to a series of studies that showed the central role of g in predicting pilot success. In comparative analyses, g was found to be a better predictor of pilot criteria than specific abilities. However, some specific abilities or measures of job knowledge were found to increment the predictiveness of g. Several selection variables that appeared to measure characteristics other than g were found to measure, at least in some part, g. These include psychomotor tests and structured interviews. Finally, speculation on the future of the measurement of g is presented.</abstract>', '<title>Investigating the Predictive Validity of the COMPASS Pilot Selection Test</title> <abstract>Objective: The present study examined the predictive validity of a widely used pilot selection test known as COMPASS, in terms of its ability to distinguish between candidates and predict individuals’ aptitude for flying. Background: The Computerized Pilot Aptitude Screening System, more commonly known as COMPASS is a widely used selection test for ab-initio pilots. However, a literature search failed to uncover any research examining its predictive validity. Method: Thirty-five trainee pilots completed COMPASS, along with a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator to obtain an objective flight performance measure. Hours to flying milestones, including first solo and Recreational Pilot License, along with more subjective measures such as performance ratings by flying instructors were also compared to COMPASS. Twenty non-pilots also completed COMPASS. Results: The results revealed COMPASS to be effective in distinguishing between trainee pilots and non-pilots. However, there was no relationship between COMPASS scores and the various flight performance measures. Conclusion: These results should aid decision-makers when considering the viability of pilot selection tests, and reiterate the importance of using multiple methods/tools when attempting to select appropriate candidates for a specific role. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Predicting Success in Primary Flying School From the Canadian Automated Pilot Selection System: Derivation and Cross-Validation</title> <abstract>This research derived and cross-validated an equation predicting outcome in Primary Flying School (PFS)öthe initial stage of Canadian Forces (CF) pilot trainingöfrom the Canadian Automated Pilot Selection System (CAPSS), a computer-driven, moving-base flight simulator recording up to 250,000 instrument readings per candidate. For the derivation study, 225 pilot candidates operated CAPSS before entering PFS. A pool of 20,700 summary measures (SMs) from 880 data sets was generated from the raw data. Through several cycles of analyses these measures were reduced to a single prediction equation. The equation was cross-validated on a new sample of 172 pilot candidates. The CAPSS equation significantly predicted PFS outcome for the cross-validation sample, r =. 47, p <. 00005. Classification analysis indicated that 79.4% of the candidates selected by CAPSS actually passed PFS, compared to 69.8% for the current selection system. Only 13.3% of those who could have passed were rejected, whereas the current system is estimated to reject 57.0% of qualified applicants. It is estimated that using CAPSS instead of the current selection system will double the number of PFS graduates from a group of applicants. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Background: Whereas verbal and math tests are commonly used in academic and pre-employment selection, spatial ability and perceptual speed testing are less common. Spatial ability and perceptual speed tests have been a mainstay in U.S. Air Force aviation training selection batteries for decades, as part of the process for selecting aviation training candidates. Method and Results: Factor analysis (Study 1) of spatial, perceptual speed, and academic aptitude tests shows a 2-factor solution. Meta-analysis results (Study 2) of the predictive validity of spatial and perceptual speed tests relative to verbal, math, and technical knowledge tests show spatial ability, aviation knowledge, and perceptual speed tests are better significant predictors of aviator flying performance, whereas academic aptitude best predicts classroom performance. Incremental validity analyses (Study 3) of spatial and perceptual speed above academic and technical knowledge for academic and pilot trainee flying performance were performed. Although spatial ability lacks incremental validity over academic and technical aptitude, perceptual speed has incremental validity above academic and technical aptitude for predicting pilot trainee flying performance.

A weighted composite of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) flying performance data (i.e., daily flying grades, check flight grades, and academic grades) was shown to be related closely to advanced training recommendations (fighter vs. nonfighter aircraft). This suggested that this composite score was a reasonable measure of pilot candidate quality because fighter aircraft assignments are considered more prestigious and demanding than nonfighter assignments. When the weighted composite algorithm was modified to include UPT eliminees, however, it demonstrated little utility in adding to our understanding of the relation between performance on selection instruments (i.e., test scores) and training performance (i.e., had little impact on the rankings of the applicants). These results were not surprising, however, as the dichotomous UPT final outcome indicator was strongly correlated with UPT performance as measured by the weighted composite scores. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, the differential psychometric impact of routine operational flights versus high-intensity air demonstrations remains poorly characterized. Purpose: To examine and compare mood state fluctuations elicited by distinct aerial mission profiles—operational maintenance (OM) flights and aerobatic demonstrations (AD)—within a specialized military pilot cohort. Methods: In this within-subject, crossover experimental design, nine elite male aviators (mean age: 32.1 ± 1.8 years) from the Brazilian Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron (EDA), each with >1,000 cumulative flight hours, were assessed across two mission contexts. Mood states were measured pre- and post-flight using the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), which evaluates six psychological dimensions: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Paired comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Results: OM flights were associated with a statistically significant increase in depression scores post-flight (p = 0.031), alongside a non-significant trend toward decreased tension (p = 0.098). Other subscales showed no statistically significant variation, though intra-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Emotional reactivity among high-performance military pilots varies according to mission typology. Incorporating continuous affective monitoring and routine psychological assessments may bolster both operational readiness and mental health preservation in high-demand aviation environments. © © 2025 Santana, Pivetta, Da Silva, Campos, Farinatti, Almeida, Verame, Brandão and Figueira Junior.</abstract>', ""<title>Neuroendocrine responses to real and simulated BA Hawk MK 51 flight</title> <abstract>The effects of psychological workload on the plasma levels of eight neuroendocrine hormones were studied in 5 undergraduate and 5 senior military pilots of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). All subjects performed the same short- term basic flight mission, which included the following: 1) start; 2) ILS- approach in minimum weather conditions; 3) visual approach; and 4) landing. The mission was performed twice: first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with a BA Hawk MK 51 let trainer with Gx- forces below +2. Blood samples were collected 30 min before and 10 min after the mission and were measured for adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, β- endorphin, prolactin, vasopressin (AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and cortisol. The plasma levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, β- endorphin, and cortisol did not change significantly in response to simulated or real flight. Plasma prolactin levels increased significantly (p = 0.037) in all subjects after the mission performed with jet trainer, and the increase was especially great in cadets. However, the same mission performed with the simulator did not raise plasma prolactin levels. This finding suggests that the psychological workload in a flight simulator does not correspond to the psychological workload in a real jet trainer, at least not in basic flying. Plasma AVP increased significantly (p = 0.032) after the mission performed with the simulator in cadets; this increase can be described as a 'first-time effect.' Plasma ANP also increased significantly (p < 0.05) after a real jet trainer flight. ANP generally maintains the electrolyte and water balance, but it is possible that elevated plasma ANP levels during a military flight are due to an increased workload of the heart and sympathetic stimuli. Because the psychological workload of the flight missions was not extreme, basic military flying had no effect off the usual stress hormones such as ACTH, β-endorphin, and cortisol in this study. Certain hormones, especially prolactin, and to a lesser degree ANP and AVP, appear to be sensitive to psychological workload.</abstract>"", '<title>Neuroendocrine responses to psychological workload of instrument flying in student pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Information processing and stress tolerance are necessary features for instrument flying (IRF), especially among student pilots. Psychological workload of IFR flight may lead to stress reactions such as neuroendocrine activity. Methods: Neuroendocrine responses to an IFR flight with Vinka piston-engined primary trainer were studied in 35 male volunteers who participated in the basic military flying course of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). The student pilots performed a 40-min IFR flight mission and a control session on land in randomized order between 11.00 h and 15.00 h. The IFR flight included 3 NDB approaches and was evaluated by flight instructors. Blood samples were collected 15 min before, 5 min and 60 min after the flight as well as control session, and. Plasma ACTH, β-endorphin (BE), cortisol, prolactin, adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) were measured. Psychological evaluations included psychomotor test (Wiener), Multi Coordination and Attention Test, ability tests and personality tests (CMPS and 16 PF). The overall psychological evaluation was made by an aviation psychologist. Results: Plasma ACTH was significantly higher before and 5 min after the flight compared with control levels, but plasma BE increased significantly only before the flight. Plasma cortisol was significantly elevated before and 5 min after the flight. Plasma prolactin. NA and A increases were significant 5 min after the flight. High A levels after the flight correlated significantly with poor IFR flight performance as well as with poor psychomotor test results. Conclusions: The plasma prolactin and NA increases after the flight represented a direct type of stress reaction to the flight situation. The plasma BE response to IFR flight was an anticipatory stress reaction, but plasma ACTH, cortisol and A responses included both anticipatory and direct types of stress reactions. Psychological factors, flight performance and neuroendocrine responses to IFR flight appear to be associated with each other. Therefore, neuroendocrine reactions as a response to the psychological workload of military flying could be used for identifying stress tolerance in military pilots.</abstract>', '<title>Neuroendocrine responses of flight cadets during midterm tests and of fighter pilots during tail chase sorties</title> <abstract>Urinary excretion of catecholamines (CA), epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE) was determined in flight cadets (n = 46) during mid-term test sorties and was compared with the measures of these variables in fighter pilots (n = 65) during tail chase sorties. Flight cadets were divided into passed and failed cadets. Fighter pilots were divided into superior, above average, and average with flying ratings of >7, 6-7, and <6, respectively, and with flying experience of 2050 ± 1081 h, 884 ± 575 h, and 616 ± 756 h, respectively. CA excretion data showed significant intra- and intergroup differences. Excretion rates for CA and NE before and after flight were significantly higher in flight cadets than in fighter pilots. After flight, all the preflight urinary variables increased significantly in passed flight cadets, while changes in failed flight cadets were not significant. In all groups of fighter pilots, preflight excretion rates for CA, E, and NE rose postflight, but the differences within the groups were not significant. The NE/E ratio decreased significantly as a function of flight adaptation. The pre- and postflight NE/E ratios were lower in fighter pilots than in flight cadets. The ΔNE/E ratio decreased in fighter pilots, but increased in flight cadets. The preflight NE/E ratio was smaller for superior than for above average and average fighter pilots, and for passed than for failed flight cadets. The postflight NE/E ratio did not show any significant differences within the groups. In superior fighter pilots, the ΔNE/E ratio remained relatively stable, while it was reduced in above average and average fighter pilots. An unchanged or a reduced ΔNE/E ratio can be regarded as rapid adaptation of sympathoadrenal activity to flying stress. In passed flight cadets, ΔNE/E ratio rose, indicating a flight-induced sympathoadrenal stimulation. This can be interpreted as a prerequisite for flight adaptation during initial phase of flight training. On the contrary, failed flight cadets exhibited a higher preflight NE/E ratio which showed a postflight reduction. This can occur because of overstimulation and reduced responsiveness of sympathoadrenal activity before and during flight, respectively. These changes may represent a neuroendocrine response which might represent a failure to adapt.</abstract>', '<title>Metabolic flexibility associated with flight time among combat pilots of the Brazilian air force</title> <abstract>Introduction: Fighter pilots must support the effects of many stressors, including physical and psychological exertion, circadian disturbance, jet lag, and environmental stress. Despite the rigorous selection of military pilots, those factors predispose to failures in physiological compensatory mechanisms and metabolic flexibility. Objectives: We compared through NMR-based metabolomics the metabolic profile of Brazilian F5 fighter pilots with different flight experiences vs. the control group of non-pilots. We hypothesized that combat pilots have metabolic flexibility associated with combat flight time. Methods: We evaluated for the first time 34 Brazilian fighter pilots from Santa Cruz Air Base (Rio de Janeiro, RJ) allocated into three groups: pilots with lower total accumulated flight experience < 1,100\xa0h (PC1, n = 7); pilots with higher total accumulated flight experience ≥ 1,100\xa0h (PC2, n = 6); military non-pilots (CONT, n = 21). Data collection included anthropometric measurements, total blood count, lipidogram, markers of oxidative stress, and serum NMR-based metabolomics. Results: In comparison with controls (p < 0.05), pilots exhibited decreased levels of white blood cells (−13%), neutrophils (−15%), lymphocytes (−20%), alfa-glucose (−13%), lactate (−26%), glutamine (−11%), histidine (−20%), and tyrosine (−11%), but higher isobutyrate (+ 10%) concentrations. Significant correlations were found between lactate vs. amino acids in CONT (r = 0.55–0.68, p < 0.001), and vs. glutamine in PC2 (r = 0.94, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Fighter pilots with lower experience showed a dysregulation in immune-metabolic function in comparison with controls, which seemed to be counteracted by the accumulation of flight hours. Those findings might have implications for the health preservation and operational training of fighter pilots. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract>']"

Highlights of these programs are presented here, with special attention given to by far the largest, the Air Forces program. After World War Il, many of the hundreds of psychologist veterans became prominent research psychologists. Most became university professors. Among those who continued to work in applied settings was John Flanagan who had served as Chief of the Army Air Forces Psychology Branch. (After the war, Saul Sells succeeded Flanagan as Head of the Aviation Psychology program.) Flanagan founded the American Institutes for Research (AIR), the earliest mission of which was to select flight personnel for civilian airlines. Another part of the AIR mission was to enhance civilian air safety by assuring the widespread use of Flanagan's critical-incident procedures (or near-accident reports) that now serve to reduce accident rates in a variety of industries as well as in aviation.

Aviation psychology is a sphere of psychology that makes a significant contribution to ensuring aviation safety. The changes taking place at different levels of aviation psychology methodology require prompt reflection and critical assessment for prognostication of its further development. The purpose of this paper is to study the current stage of aviation psychology development in science and education, based on the materials from foreign and Russian sources. Materials and methods. The research materials represent a corpus of articles of foreign and Russian periodicals, collections of applied research conferences, monographs, and training toolkits. The research method represents the analysis of aviation psychology development directions, along with the consideration of peculiarities of the Russian aviation psychology development. Results. Aviation psychologists investigate the causes of aviation accidents caused by the human factor, improve the methods of psychological selection and simulator training, resolve the problems of optimisation of aircraft-specific work and find prerequisites for efficient operation of unmanned aerial vehicles in the conditions of the technological progress in the aerospace industry. Aviation psychology is taught at specialised higher education institutions and aviation training centres. Aviation psychology is in possession of inexhaustible cognitive resources for vocational guidance of young people. Conclusion. The current state of development of aviation psychology in science and education makes it possible to solve the pressing tasks aimed at increasing the reliability of aviation as a defence transport system. Most publications are related to engineering and psychological tasks involved in securing flight safety in the context of cockpit and control equipment ergonomics design, information support for pilots; improving the methodology of flight- and ground training of pilots based on digital technologies; development of interfaces for operators of remotely piloted aircraft.

Reference is here being made most specifically to the reaction-time experiment for one, salvaged by the workers on aviation problems. And new experiments with new techniques were fashioned and new combinations of old techniques were instituted. What experiments were designed and performed to meet the requirements attending the classification of aviators and prospective aviators in Italy, France, England, and this country during the war are admirably and extensively described by Dockeray and Isaacs in this article, the summary being an excellent review of the foreign and domestic literature on the subject. Many and exceedingly interesting results of the experiments, most of them obtained from numerous subjects, are cited, but they are too numerous and too well organized in the writers' summary to enumerate here. Two important results were the following: (1) Practically all of the best pursuit pilots belonged to the sensory reaction-time type, and exhibited a keen perception of the position of the body, low visual reaction-times, low choice reaction-times, and a low average deviation in reaction-time. Resistance to influences of emotional stimuli was not always present or necessary, some of the best pilots being quite susceptible to emotional conditions. (2) Practically all of the best slow machine, bombing, aviators were motors in reaction-time; and Caproni pilots exhibited resistance to emotional stimuli. From Psych Bulletin 18:06:00361.

A first step in predicting how future changes will impact flight crews and ATC is to examine the current system and to pinpoint problematic areas that could be ameliorated or exacerbated by advanced automation and heavier traffic density. In this study, we coded Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports identified as having communication conflicts between pilots and ATC. Results describe types of conflict, operational context, phase of flight, operator states, and situations conducive to communication conflicts, risk perception differences, and inappropriate resolution strategies. Reports suggest that high workload approach and landing phases are conducive to communication conflicts, that different interpretations of the same information might lead to conflict, and that operator state could impact communication and collaboration between flight crews and ATC. A specific problem was noted when reporters felt that the affective response of the other party was not appropriate to the situation. Although this study reflects the limitations inherent in ASRS data, it can provide insights into potential problem areas and conflict triggers in NextGen operations. This research will enable us to better predict NextGen aircrew-ATC communication breakdowns and conflicts resulting from specific situations or operator states. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Air traffic controller performance and workload under mature free flight: Conflict detection and resolution of aircraft self-separation</title> <abstract>The effects of conflict detection and self-separating aircraft resolution on the mental workload and performance of en-route air traffic controllers were examined. An air traffic control simulator was used to manipulate traffic loads and traffic complexity. A mature stage of free flight was simulated by having controllers monitor self-separating aircraft. Four 30-min scenarios were created to combine moderate (11 aircraft) and heavy traffic loads (17 aircraft) in a 50-mile radius sector with the presence or absence of self-separating and conflicting aircraft. Conflicts (defined as a loss of separation of 5 nm laterally and 1,000 ft vertically) were indicated to the controller by the appearance of a red circle around each of the aircraft involved. A self-separation event was defined as an evasive maneuver (either altitude or speed change) made by 1 aircraft to avoid a potential conflict with another aircraft. Performance and workload measurements indicated that controllers had difficulty both in detecting conflicts and in recognizing self-separating events in a timely manner in saturated airspace. Controller mental workload also increased, as indexed both by subjective and secondary task measures. Implications for the design of automated tools to support controllers under free flight environments are discussed.</abstract>', '<title>The Difficulty to Break a Relational Complexity Network Can Predict Air Traffic Controllers’ Mental Workload and Performance in Conflict Resolution</title> <abstract>Objective: To test the network disentangling model for explaining air traffic controllers’ (ATCos) conflict resolution performance. The network rigidity index (NRI), and the steps to break the relational complexity network following a central-available-node-first rule, was hypothesized to explain the overall task demand, whereas marginal-effort-decrease rule was expected to explain the actual operational outcome. Background: Understanding the conflict resolution process of ATCos is important for aviation safety and efficiency. However, linear models are insufficient. We proposed a new model that ATCos behavior can be largely considered as a process to break the relational complexity network, in which nodes represent the aircraft while links represent the cognitive complexity to understand the aircraft dyad relationship. Method: Twenty-one professional ATCos completed 27 conflict resolution scenarios that varied in the NRI and other control variables. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to understand the influence of the NRI on the number of interventions, mental workload, and unresolved rate. A cross-validation was performed to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Results: NRI influenced ATCos intervention number in a curvilinear manner, which further leads to ATCo’s mental workload. The deviance between the number of interventions and the NRI was strongly linked with unresolved rate. Cross-validation suggests that the models predictions are robust. Conclusion: The network disentangling model provides a useful theory-driven way to explain controllers’ conflict resolution workload and other important performance outcomes such as intervention probability. Application: The proposed model can potentially be used for workload management, sector design, and intelligent decision support tool development. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>', '<title>Effects of NextGen Concepts of Operation for Separation Assurance and Interval Management on Air Traffic Controller Situation Awareness, Workload, and Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: Determine how combinations of NextGen-automation concepts for separation assurance and spacing affect air traffic controller (ATCo) situation awareness, workload, and performance. Background: In previous research, situation awareness was not measured with valid and reliable instruments. Previous work also evaluated separation assurance and spacing concepts individually, and did not examine weather. Method: Retired ATCos worked en route and transitional sectors. Four operating concepts for separation assurance and spacing were tested based on whether automation or ATCo was responsible for each function. Standard methods for assessing workload and situation awareness were used; performance measures included safety and efficiency. Results: Workload was lowest when both functions were automated; however, situation awareness depended on operating concept and sector. In the en route sector, the highest levels of situation awareness were found for ATCo-managed separation assurance and automation-managed spacing. In the transitional sector, the highest situation awareness occurred when ATCos performed both functions. The numbers of loss of separation were highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance; sector complexity depended on weather, but only for automation-managed separation assurance. Spacing efficiency was highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance, but more communications were required. Conclusion: In air traffic management, separation assurance and spacing functions interact with each other in determining ATCo workload, situation awareness, and performance, depending on sector characteristics and weather. Therefore, evaluations of NextGen-automation solutions must include multiple concepts of operation, and involve different sectors and environmental conditions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Determinants of conflict detection: A model of risk judgments in air traffic control</title> <abstract>Objective: A model of conflict judgments in air traffic control (ATC) is proposed. Background: Three horizontal distances determine risk judgments about conflict between two aircraft: (a) Dt<inf>0</inf> is the distance between the crossing of the aircraft trajectories and the first aircraft to reach that point; (b) Dt<inf>h</inf> is the distance between the two aircraft when they are horizontally closest; and (c) Dt<inf>v</inf> is the horizontal distance between the two aircraft when their growing vertical distance reaches 1,000 feet. Methods: Two experiments tested whether the variables in the model reflect what controllers do. In Experiment 1, 125 certified controllers provided risk judgments about situations in which the model variables were manipulated. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between the model and expertise by comparing a population of certified controllers with a population of ATC students. Results: Across both experiments, the model accounted for 44% to 50% of the variance in risk judgments by certified controllers (N = 161) but only 20% in judgments by ATC students (N = 88). There were major individual differences in the predictive power of the model as well as in the contributions of the three variables. In Experiment 2, the model described experts better than novices. Conclusion: The model provided a satisfying account of the data, albeit with substantial individual differences. It is argued that an individual-differences approach is required when investigating the strategies involved in conflict judgment in ATC. Application: These findings should have implications for developing user-friendly interfaces with conflict detection devices and for devising ATC training programs.

The amount of fatigue experienced by the aviators in an operational EP-3 squadron was quantified before and after interventions were made to promote crew rest. Surveys were completed for 10 days by 2 separate flight crews transitioning to a Southwest Asia detachment site from Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington. The second crew (Crew B) underwent fatigue countermeasures training several days prior to departure and were provided with 1 additional layover day between the second and third day of transit. The additional layover period was provided in an effort to maximize crew rest prior to a difficult night transit 3 days into the journey. The surveys quantified: self-reported sleep quantity, sleep quality, sleep debt, and fatigue ratings during the 3 phases of flight: takeoff to top of climb, top of climb to top of descent, and top of descent to landing. Baseline data were collected from the first crew (Crew A) and were then compared to that of the second crew (Crew B). Crew A experienced greater fatigue, a larger sleep debt, and decreased sleep quality compared to Crew B. Both crews demonstrated low sleep quality ratings on the second day of the transit as well as high fatigue ratings after the third leg of the transit. Crew B received more total sleep prior to the third leg of the transit due to the additional layover day. This additional rest period resulted in decreased fatigue ratings for Crew B. Sleep quality tended to be lower on the nights preceding a scheduled flight and higher on days off. Providing additional layover time and fatigue countermeasures training resulted in decreased fatigue, increased sleep quantity, and improved sleep quality.</abstract>', '<title>Two-crew operations: Stress and fatigue during long-haul night flights</title> <abstract>Background: As part of a research program concerning legal aspects of two-pilot operations on long-haul routes, the purpose of the study was to investigate two-crew extended range operations during a flight roster with two consecutive night flights and a short layover. Hypothesis: Present flight time regulations may not be adequate for two-crew minimum operations. Methods: The study was conducted in cooperation with a German airline company on the route Frankfurt (FRA)-Mahe (SEZ). There were 11 rotations (22 flights) that were investigated by pre-, in- and post-flight data collection each time from the two pilots. Recordings included sleep, taskload, fatigue and stress by measurement of EEG, ECG, motor activity, and subjective ratings. The average actual flight times were 9:15 h (FRA-SEZ) and 9:53 h (SEZ-FRA). All flights took place at night. The layover duration in Mahe was 13:30 h during daytime. Results: During layover, sleep was shortened by 2 h on average compared with 8-h baseline sleep. The two consecutive night duties resulted in a sleep loss of 9.3 h upon return to home base. Inflight ratings of taskload showed moderate grades, but for fatigue ratings an increasing level was observed. Fatigue was more pronounced during the return flight and several pilots scored, their fatigue at a critical level. Motor activity, brainwave activity (occurrences of micro-events) and heart rate indicated drowsiness and a low state of vigilance and alertness during both night flights, but these effects were more pronounced during the second flight. Conclusions: From the findings it is concluded that a duty roster as conducted in this study, may impose excessive demands on mental and physiological capacity.</abstract>', ""<title>An exploration of the utility of mathematical modeling predicting fatigue from sleep/wake history and circadian phase applied in accident analysis and prevention: The crash of Comair Flight 5191</title> <abstract>On 27 August 2006 at 0606 eastern daylight time (EDT) at Bluegrass Airport in Lexington, KY (LEX), the flight crew of Comair Flight 5191 inadvertently attempted to take off from a general aviation runway too short for their aircraft. The aircraft crashed killing 49 of the 50 people on board. To better understand this accident and to aid in preventing similar accidents, we applied mathematical modeling predicting fatigue-related degradation in performance for the Air Traffic Controller on-duty at the time of the crash. To provide the necessary input to the model, we attempted to estimate circadian phase and sleep/wake histories for the Captain, First Officer, and Air Traffic Controller. We were able to estimate with confidence the circadian phase for each. We were able to estimate with confidence the sleep/wake history for the Air Traffic Controller, but unable to do this for the Captain and First Officer. Using the sleep/wake history estimates for the Air Traffic Controller as input, the mathematical modeling predicted moderate fatigue-related performance degradation at the time of the crash. This prediction was supported by the presence of what appeared to be fatigue-related behaviors in the Air Traffic Controller during the 30 min prior to and in the minutes after the crash. Our modeling results do not definitively establish fatigue in the Air Traffic Controller as a cause of the accident, rather they suggest that had he been less fatigued he might have detected Comair Flight 5191's lining up on the wrong runway. We were not able to perform a similar analysis for the Captain and First Officer because we were not able to estimate with confidence their sleep/wake histories. Our estimates of sleep/wake history and circadian rhythm phase for the Air Traffic Controller might generalize to other air traffic controllers and to flight crew operating in the early morning hours at LEX. Relative to other times of day, the modeling results suggest an elevated risk of fatigue-related error, incident, or accident in the early morning due to truncated sleep from the early start and adverse circadian phase from the time of day. This in turn suggests that fatigue mitigation targeted to early morning starts might reduce fatigue risk. In summary, this study suggests that mathematical models predicting performance from sleep/wake history and circadian phase are (1) useful in retrospective accident analysis provided reliable sleep/wake histories are available for the accident personnel and, (2) useful in prospective fatigue-risk identification, mitigation, and accident prevention. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.</abstract>"", '<title>Risk factors for fatigue among airline pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: The objective of this study is to determine risk factors for fatigue among airline pilots, taking into account person-, work-, health-, sleep-, and lifestyle-related characteristics. Methods: The study population consisted of 502 pilots who participated in the MORE Energy study. Included risk factors were either measured through an online questionnaire or provided by the company. The outcome of this study, fatigue, was assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and was defined as scoring more than 76 points on this questionnaire. The association of the risk factors with fatigue was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the participating pilots, 29.5\xa0% scored more than 76 points on the CIS and were classified as being fatigued. The fully adjusted regression model showed that person-, work-, health-, and lifestyle-related characteristics were associated with fatigue. Pilots who were aged 31 to 40 (OR 3.36, 95\xa0% CI 1.32–8.53) or 41 to 50 (OR 4.19, 95\xa0% CI 1.40–12.47), an evening type (OR 2.40, 95\xa0% CI 1.38–4.16), scored higher on work-life balance disturbance (OR 1.22, 95\xa0% CI 1.10–1.36), scored higher on need for recovery (OR 1.02, 95\xa0% CI 1.01–1.04), scored lower on general health perception (OR 0.31, 95\xa0% CI 0.20–0.47), were less physically active (OR 0.77, 95\xa0% CI 0.66–0.89), and had a moderate alcohol consumption (OR 3.88, 95\xa0% CI 1.21–12.43), were at higher risk for fatigue. Conclusions: Higher age, being an evening type, disturbance of the work-life balance, more need for recovery, a lower perceived health, less physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption were shown to be risk factors for fatigue. Further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the direction of the associations found and to evaluate the effects of possible countermeasures in airline pilots. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</abstract>', ""<title>Aircrew fatigue in long-haul operations</title> <abstract>The studies were conducted on the transmeridian routes Düsseldorf (DUS)-Atlanta (ATL) and Hamburg (HAM)-Los Angeles (LAX), and on the north-south route Frankfurt (FRA)-Mahe (SEZ). Scheduled flight duration was between 8:50 hours (ATL-DUS) and 11:50 hours (HAM-LAX). In total, 25 rotations (50 flights) have been investigated by pre-, in- and post-flight data collection of sleep, taskload, fatigue and stress by electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram measurements and subjective ratings. Inflight ratings of taskload showed low perceived exertion during the Atlantic nights, and were moderate during the north-south transitions. Fatigue ratings increased with progressing flight duration. Towards the end of long U.S.-westcoast flights performed at day-time, and in all night flights, fatigue was elevated compared to the 'baseline' ratings collected during the day-time DUS-ATL flights. Fatigue was rated as being 'critical' by several pilots, particularly during the return flight SEZ-FRA when fatigue was severely pronounced. From the findings it is concluded that duty schedules, as performed on the route HAM-LAX (because of long duty hours), and particularly on the route FRA-SEZ (because of consecutive night work), may place excessive demands on mental and physiological capacity. With respect to legal aspects, the results are significant and should promote further deliberations for advanced schemes of flight duty time limitations and rest requirements. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.</abstract>""]"

We studied the epidemiology of PD in a USAF aircrew population. Methods: Occurrence of PD during the period 2001-2008 was determined using the USAF Aeromedical Information Management Waiver Tracking System, a database containing medical disqualifications and waivers for the entire population of both qualified and disqualified (grounded) USAF aviators. Results: The mean annual USAF pilot and navigator population averaged 17,727 during the study period. The database yielded nine cases labeled as PD. After records review by two experienced aeromedical psychiatrists, only three of the nine cases met diagnostic criteria for PD. Estimated annual PD prevalence was 0.002% (2/100,000) in USAF pilots and navigators. Annual prevalence of PD was 2.7% in the general U.S. population 18 yr of age and older and 2.4% in a group of manager/professionals. Odds ratios were 1228 (55/27,269) and 1089 (49/24,175) for the general population and manager/professionals, respectively. Discussion: One of three individuals with PD received a waiver to resume flying after successful treatment. Five of the six cases not meeting criteria for PD (but suffering from varying degrees of situational and/or stress related anxiety) were flying with waivers. The negligible annual PD prevalence in USAF pilots and navigators likely reflects lower aircrew vulnerability to PD because of selection and training processes and does not pose a disease burden upon force strength. © by the Aerospace Medical Association,.</abstract>', '<title>The Most Common Disqualifying Medical Conditions in Army Aviators, 2016–2020</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Military aviators have long undergone enhanced medical screening to minimize accidents and deaths. U.S. Army aviators undergo a rigorous initial screening process followed by annual medical evaluations governed by published standards of medical fitness which are updated periodically. An aeromedical summary is submitted for disqualifying conditions, resulting in either a waiver of the standard or suspension of flight status. This study aimed to identify the most common disqualifying medical conditions in U.S. Army aviators in recent years and analyze trends over time. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed using 5 yr of data from the U.S. Army’s Aeromedical Epidemiological Data Repository. Incidence rates for the 10 most common disqualifying conditions, and the waiver approval rate for those conditions, were calculated. Annual incidence was calculated for hypertension aeromedical summary submissions. RESULTS: L umbar and cervical spinal disorders (101.55 and 39.26 per 10,000 aviator-years, 81.6% and 79.1% waived, respectively), obstructive sleep apnea (62.00 per 10,000 aviator-years, 93.4% waived), hearing loss (27.96 per 10,000 aviator-years, 98.0% waived), and hypertension (26.13 per 10,000 aviator-years, 97.3% waived) were the most common conditions submitted. Psychological diagnoses were also common, with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and phobias, adjustment disorder, and mood disorders having a cumulative incidence of 44.20 per 10,000 aviator-years and a waiver rate of 45.4%. Submissions for hypertension substantially decreased starting in 2019. DISCUSSION: S pine disorders are among the leading disqualifying conditions in U.S. Army aviators and metabolic conditions were submitted less often than previously reported, likely due to changes in aeromedical policy with respect to hypertension. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Senior Aviator Medical Qualification Status</title> <abstract>Introduction: Aviation personnel are expensive to train and challenging for the services to retain because of lucrative opportunities in the civilian aviation sector and a desire among pilots for agency. The military services' retention efforts have typically utilized a combination of high continuation pays and longer service commitments of up to 10 years following initial training. One area that the services have overlooked in their attempts to retain senior aviators is quantifying and reducing medical disqualifications. Much as aging aircraft require increasing maintenance to retain full operational capability, so may pilots and other aircrew members. Materials and Methods: This article reports on a prospectively collected cross-sectional research study evaluating the medical status of senior aviation personnel who reported being considered or selected for command. The study was deemed exempt from human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board and a waiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was granted. The study, which collected data at the Pentagon Flight Medical Clinic over 1 year, used a chart review of routine medical encounters and flight physicals to collect descriptive data. The goals of the study were to establish the prevalence of medically disqualifying conditions, assess the association between disqualifying conditions and age, and generate hypotheses for further research. Logistic regression of waiver need was performed for variables including prior waivers, waiver count, service, platform, age, and gender. ANOVA of readiness percentages vs. DoD targets were assessed between the services individually and in aggregate. Results: The study demonstrated medical readiness rates among command-eligible senior aviators ranging from 74% for the Air Force to 40% for the Army with the Navy and Marine Corps in the middle. The sample was insufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in readiness between the services; however, the population as a whole was significantly below the DoD's readiness target of >90% (P =. 000). Conclusions: None of the services met the DoD minimum readiness target of 90%. Markedly higher readiness was observed in the Air Force, the only service with a medical screening incorporated into its command selection process, but this difference was not statistically significant. Waivers increased with age and musculoskeletal concerns were common. A larger prospective cohort study should be considered to further elucidate and confirm the findings of this study. If further research confirms these findings, consideration should be made of screening command applicants for medical readiness. © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

In an idealized flight operation that has become real thanks to the implementation of more and more sophisticated tools, Air Force personnel must deal with the dangers inherent in an aeronautical environment. These specific constraints (the decrease of atmospheric pressure, constraints related to the aircraft, equipment and mission) justify an adaptation of the current medical-psychological training in the armed forces. This preparation is continuous throughout the different stages of an airman's career, both in terms of expertise and medical and psychological support, through a process carried out by different actors, which include the medical service of clinical psychology applied to aeronautics (SMPCAA). It aims to ensure both flight safety and the mental health of the flight crew. The medical-psychological assessment in aeronautics is based on military and international regulations. A qualified psychiatrist, having adequate knowledge and experience in aviation medecine, explores anamnesis and the behavioral, affective and cognitive fields to evaluate the airman's prognosis for adaptation. In addition to the medical history or current psychiatric disorders, the psychiatrist looks for a pathological or delusional personality, contraphobic, escapist, fragile or non-authentic motivation. An airman's mental fitness during their career is more nuanced than their initial mental health which does not take into consideration the necessary adaptation to the job. Medical and psychological support takes place in the continuity of the normal fitness assessment. SMPCAA coordinates this support, with the Air Force's clinical psychology unit (CPC'Air). This unit, which was initially created to carry out post-immediate medical-psychological interventions following serious traumatic events, also provides training, operational psychological support, and psychotherapy. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract>"", ""<title>Medical Suspension in Female Army Rotary-Wing Aviators</title> <abstract>Introduction Female aviators with health conditions may face a variety of occupational impacts. Outcomes may include a waiver for continued flight or a permanent suspension, in which flight is no longer possible. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of medical diagnosis among female U.S. Army aviators over a ten year period and identify associations of clinical diagnoses leading to waiver or permanent suspension. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary data analysis; data were retrieved on 1,282 female, rated aviator patients from an Army Aviation epidemiological database. The archival dataset was composed of a total of 6,856 cases between June 2005 and June 2015. Age ranged from 19 to 58 years. The data were examined in terms of raw ICD-9 diagnostic codes, grouped system diagnoses (diagnosis categories), and occupational consequence. Spearman's rho correlations were used to determine associations between diagnosis, waiver and permanent suspension. Results The leading diagnoses were pregnancy, normal delivery, and allergic rhinitis. The systems approach yielded pregnancy, orthopedic disorders, and spinal disorders as the leading diagnosis categories. Leading waivered conditions included spinal, psychiatric, and neurological disorders. In terms of permanent suspension, the leading cause was depression, followed by migraine and post-traumatic stress disorders. In almost all diagnostic groupings, the Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between age and diagnosis were positively related. However, age was not associated with negative occupational outcome (permanent suspension), generally. Conclusions A variety of conditions negatively impact the health and occupational status of female aviators, with disparate occupational impacts. Prevalent conditions differed from those reported previously for all aviators in a predominantly male population. The absence of cardiovascular disease is a significant change from 20-30 years ago. Among all medical diagnoses, a minority are responsible for a greater occupational burden. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.</abstract>""]"

Even though it is being used for health purposes, studies involving eye-tracking are rare in the field of endo-neuro-surgery. This study aims to use this technology to promote our understanding of the effect related to computer-based instructional materials on mental workload of endo-neurosurgery residents. Four computer-based simulation scenarios are developed based on skill develop-ment requirements of endo-neurosurgery residents. Two of them were designed as general models and the other two as simulated surgical models. During these surgery procedures, in real settings, surgical residents need to use their both hands simultaneously to control the endoscope and the operational tool in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, to shed light on the participants' behaviors, these scenarios are performed with dominant-hand, non-dominant hand and, finally with both-hands using haptic interfaces. Twenty-three residents volun-teered in this study. Their eye-movements were recorded while performing the scenarios. According to the results of this study, when performing the simulated surgical models, an increase in the participants' mental workload was recorded when compared to the other scenarios. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the eye-movements of surgical residents can provide insights about the anticipated level of difficulty about the skill-based tasks.

Background: Building on previous research that underscores the importance of situational awareness in aviation, this work delves into the specific aspects of gaze behavior as indicators of cognitive workload and attentional distribution. Unlike prior studies that broadly assessed attentional markers, this research utilizes advanced iris tracking technology to pinpoint how gaze metrics correlate with flight performance. Method: Employing a quantitative research design, the study analyzed over 45 simulated instrument flight approaches conducted by 15 pilots. Detailed metrics of gaze behavior, including fixation duration, saccade rate, scanning patterns, and gaze variability, were captured using iris tracking technology. A novel metric, exceedance autocorrelation, was introduced to assess aircraft control deviations and pilot performance. Results: Statistical analyses uncovered significant correlations: fixation duration exhibited a strong positive correlation with control quality (r = 0.684), and saccade rate correlated even more strongly (r = 0.827). Conversely, scan pattern predictability and gaze variability correlated negatively (r = −0.55) and positively (r = 0.546), respectively, highlighting their relevance under high cognitive workload conditions. Conclusion: The results confirms that specific gaze behaviors are critical indicators of pilot performance in challenging flight scenarios. These insights advance our understanding of pilot attentional mechanisms, offering valuable implications for enhancing aviation safety through improved training programs and cockpit technology design. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Comparison Between Scene-Independent and Scene-Dependent Eye Metrics in Assessing Psychomotor Skills</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aims to compare the relative sensitivity between scene-independent and scene-dependent eye metrics in assessing trainees' performance in simulated psychomotor tasks. Background: Eye metrics have been extensively studied for skill assessment and training in psychomotor tasks, including aviation, driving, and surgery. These metrics can be categorized as scene-independent or scene-dependent, based on whether predefined areas of interest are considered. There is a paucity of direct comparisons between these metric types, particularly in their ability to assess performance during early training. Method: Thirteen medical students practiced the peg transfer task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. Scene-independent and scene-dependent eye metrics, completion time, and tool motion metrics were derived from eye-tracking data and task videos. K-means clustering of nine eye metrics identified three groups of practice trials with similar gaze behaviors, corresponding to three performance levels verified by completion time and tool motion metrics. A random forest model using eye metrics estimated classification accuracy and determined the feature importance of the eye metrics. Results: Scene-dependent eye metrics demonstrated a clearer linear trend with performance levels than scene-independent metrics. The random forest model achieved 88.59% accuracy, identifying the top four predictors of performance as scene-dependent metrics, whereas the two least effective predictors were scene-independent metrics. Conclusion: Scene-dependent eye metrics are overall more sensitive than scene-independent ones for assessing trainee performance in simulated psychomotor tasks. Application: The study’s findings are significant for advancing eye metrics in psychomotor skill assessment and training, enhancing operator competency, and promoting safe operations. © 2024 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"", ""<title>Pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Attention plays a central role in cognitive processing; ineffective attention may induce accidents in flight operations. The objective of the current research was to examine military pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target. METHOD: In the current research, 37 mission-ready F-16 pilots participated. Subjects' eye movements were collected by a portable head-mounted eye-tracker during tactical training in a flight simulator. The scenarios of chasing a moving target (air-to-air) and a stationary target (air-to-surface) consist of three operational phases: searching, aiming, and lock-on to the targets. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated significant differences in pilots' percentage of fixation during the searching phase between air-to-air (M = 37.57, SD = 5.72) and air-to-surface (M = 33.54, SD = 4.68). Fixation duration can indicate pilots' sustained attention to the trajectory of a dynamic target during air combat maneuvers. Aiming at the stationary target resulted in larger pupil size (M = 27,105, SD = 6565), reflecting higher cognitive loading than aiming at the dynamic target (M = 23,864, SD = 8762). DISCUSSION: Pilots' visual behavior is not only closely related to attention distribution, but also significantly associated with task characteristics. Military pilots demonstrated various visual scan patterns for searching and aiming at different types of targets based on the research settings of a flight simulator. The findings will facilitate system designers' understanding of military pilots' cognitive processes during tactical operations. They will assist human-centered interface design to improve pilots' situational awareness. The application of an eye-tracking device integrated with a flight simulator is a feasible and cost-effective intervention to improve the efficiency and safety of tactical training. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", ""<title>Mining attention distribution paradigm: Discover gaze patterns and their association rules behind the visual image</title> <abstract>Background and Objective: Attention allocation reflects the way of humans filtering and organizing the information. On one hand, different task scenarios seriously affect human's rule of attention distribution, on the other hand, visual attention reflecting the cognitive and psychological process. Most of the previous studies on visual attention allocation are based on cognitive models, predicted models, or statistical analysis of eye movement data or visual images, however, these methods are inadequate to provide an inside view of gaze behavior to reveal the attention distribution pattern within scenario context. Moreover, they seldom study the association rules of these patterns. Therefore, we adopted the big data mining approach to discover the paradigm of visual attention distribution. Methods: We applied the data mining method to extract the gaze patterns to discover the regularities of attention distribution behavior within the scenario context. The proposed method consists of three components, tasks scenario segmented and clustered, gaze pattern mining, and association rule of frequent pattern mining. Results: The proposed approach is tested on the operation platform. The complex operation task is simultaneously segmented and clustered with the TICC-based method and evaluated by the BCI index. The operator's eye movement frequent patterns and their association rule are discovered. The results demonstrate that our method can associate the eye-tracking data with the task-oriented scene data. Discussion: The proposed method provides the benefits of being able to explicitly express and quantitatively analyze people's visual attention patterns. The proposed method can not only be applied in the field of aerospace medicine and aviation psychology, but also can likely be applied to computer-aided diagnosis and follow-up tool for neurological disease and cognitive impairment related disease, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), neglect syndrome, social attention differences in ASD (Autism spectrum disorder). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>""]"

We examined the role that flight exposure plays in mediating age and flight safety performance, as well as the role that age plays in moderating flight exposure and flight safety performance in different age groups. Pilots’ age, total flight hours of B737-800, and exceedance data from 2016 to 2018 were collected. The results showed that exceedance rates increased rapidly among pilots aged 21–40, regardless of their flight exposure levels. In addition, flight exposure mediated the association between age and exceedance rates among pilots aged 21–35; age moderated the association between flight exposure and exceedance rates among pilots aged 26–35.

Background: Various research results show variability between different generations’ abilities and achievements. It is unclear what differences emerge during the selection process to aircraft piloting studies. Methods: The admission process to aircraft piloting studies involves selecting the most capable young people between 18 and 20 years of age who have completed their secondary education and demonstrate that they possess the required abilities for such studies. Results: The tasks of the selection process are divided into four factors with the help of exploratory factor analysis–Initial information processing, 3D perception, 2D perception, and Level of analysis. The period analyzed includes representatives of Generation Y and Generation Z. The study results revealed statistically significant differences in the performance of the two generations. The results indicate that technology has a significant influence on the abilities of the candidates. Conclusions: Generation Y representatives excel in concentration and logical thinking, making fewer errors in such tasks. However, they demonstrate weaker performance in spatial thinking tasks. Conversely, Generation Z representatives outperform the former in spatial thinking and sequence arrangement tasks.

The relationship of chronological age to self-rated changes in cognition has been studied extensively. However, the relationship of these changes to age-related changes in piloting skills is not well understood. Objective: This study aims to determine whether airline pilots report age-related changes in cognitive abilities, and whether these changes are related to self-rated changes in piloting skills. Methods: A total of 1310 airline pilots (28-59 yr, mean age = 45.5 yr; mean total flight time = 11,992 h) currently employed by a major U.S. commercial air carrier participated in the study. A 13-item Aviation Experience Survey (AES) was completed by each pilot, using 5-point Likert ratings and yes/no responses comparing current cognitive abilities (e.g., concentration, reaction speed) and piloting skills (e.g., piloting in adverse weather, decision making while flying) with those of 10 yr ago. Results: Cognitive abilities and piloting skills were more likely to be rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" than 10 yr ago by pilots age 39 or under than by pilots in their 40s and 50s, who were more likely to rate their abilities and skills as ""the same."" Fewer than 20% of pilots in any age group rated their cognitive abilities or piloting skills as ""worse"" or ""much worse"" than 10 yr ago. Pilots who reported more anxiety or stress while flying reported more negative changes in abilities, skills, and health status regardless of age. Conclusions: Self-ratings of cognition and piloting skills vary by age, but older pilots are not more likely to report negative changes in their abilities and skills than younger pilots. Further research is needed to verify whether these self-appraisals reflect true changes in skills over time.</abstract>', '<title>Age, flight experience, and violation risk in mature commuter and air taxi pilots</title> <abstract>Violation of Federal Aviation Regulations has been identified as a risk factor for pilot involvement in aviation crashes. However, the associations among violations, flight experience, and pilot age have not been well studied. In this study, we aimed to examine risk of violation in relation to pilot age and other pilot characteristics based on exposure to flight in a fixed birth cohort of 3,306 commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots who in 1987 were aged 45 to 54 years. We merged different data files from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration for the years 1987 to 1997, and we analyzed violation rates per pilot flight hour in relation to total flight hours at baseline and pilot age at time of violation. During the 11-year follow-up period, a total of 12.9 million cumulative flight hours and 71 violations were recorded, yielding a rate of 5.5 violations per million pilot flight hours. Violation rate increased significantly with age from age 40 to the late 50s. Pilots who were 50 to 54 years old at baseline experienced almost twice the rate of violation involvement as pilots who were 45 to 49 years old at baseline. Total flight time at baseline, an indicator of flight experience, showed a significant protective effect against risk of violation. With adjustments for age, pilots who had 5,000 to 9,999 hr of total flight time at baseline were at significantly lower risk of violation than their less experienced counterparts (relative risk 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.85). Flight experience showed a diminishing protective effect after pilots reached 10,000 hr of total flight time.

Findings challenge assumptions that society, organizations, and employees will all unequivocally benefit from abolishing mandatory retirement by investigating the impact of age-related policy changes on US airline pilots. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 43 semi-structured interviews were conducted with captains and copilots from US airlines between September 2010 and July 2011. From this data set, two informant subgroups emerged: first, senior captains averaging 59 years of age; and second, junior pilots averaging 43.5 years of age. Findings: Findings revealed that both senior and junior pilots reported retirement age policy changes created an antagonistic environment, pitting employees against each other in competition over scarce resources. Research limitations/implications: Paper findings are based on empirical materials collected during an 11 month snapshot-in-time between September 2010 and July 2011 and interview data are based on a small subgroup of US airline pilots who self-selected to participate in the study. Therefore, findings are not unbiased and may not be generalizable across all airlines’ pilot workgroups. Practical implications: Considerable research has been conducted identifying the policy and practice changes that employers need to adopt to retain older workers. However, few studies consider the psychological impact of these age-related workplace changes on employees or the organizational psychodynamics they might trigger. Originality/value: This paper makes two main contributions. First, through use of the psychoanalytic construct of the Oedipus complex, the paper sheds light on some of the psychodynamic consequences of age-related policy changes. Second, it challenges assumptions about workforce aging and the underlying causes of intergenerational conflict, highlighting ways that policy changes intended to eradicate discrimination against older workers can result in age discrimination against younger employees. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>']"

Background: Numerous studies suggest that estimating the closest point of approach (CPA) to heavy weather is difficult, and that current in-cockpit NEXRAD may be intrinsically inadequate for the task. Method: To investigate theoretically, we first examined the visual information present in looping NEXRAD. This predicted inherent task difficulty. Next, to investigate empirically, we developed a mathematical model of an “ideal storm,” generated a looping NEXRAD-type part-task simulation, and tested 21 general aviation (GA) pilots to measure effects of weather system depth (19 vs. 40 nm), and the opening and closing of gaps at various closure rates between cells (14, 7, 0, 7, 14 kt). Results: For the values tested, weather system depth had no significant effect on clearance from heavy weather (>40 dBZ reflectivity). However, weather movement greatly degraded safety. Moreover, it did not seem to matter if movement was as slow as 7 kt, nor whether gaps were opening or closing. Any weather movement made an already difficult task more so. Conclusion: Analysis suggests the necessity of adding future-predicted weather plus a range ring. Without these two key elements, judgment of CPA will clearly remain difficult.

Background: Understanding pilot factors in weather-related diversions is integral to reducing the phenomenon of visual flight rules flight into meteorological conditions. Method: Thirty-six general aviation pilots flew a cross-country flight in a Cessna 172 simulator where they encountered an ATC-directed diversion due to deteriorating weather. Path analyses quantified effects in a two-stage model based on criteria specified by aviation regulations. Results: In stage 1, low cognitive flexibility and fewer recent pilot-in-command hours were associated with greater likelihood of ignoring the diversion instruction. Low cognitive flexibility was also associated with errors in locating the alternate aerodrome and incorrect procedures at the alternate. At stage 2, there were significant positive paths from a diversion efficiency variable to all aspects of pilotage. Pilotage positively predicted awareness of ownship and traffic, and was associated with fewer altitude violations. Conclusion: We provide empirical evidence for the association between the cognitive factors related to continuation bias and high-risk responses to diversion instructions. Using a two-stage model to conceptualize pilot performance illuminates the impact of cognitive factors in weather-related diversions.

Instead, the emphasis is on the different behaviors that pilots exhibit in the face of adverse weather and, by inference, on the decision-making processes that underlie those behaviors. Methods: This study compares three weather-related behaviors that reflect different levels of risk: visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions ('VFR into IMC'); precautionary landing; and other significant weather avoidance actions. Occurrence data (n = 491) were drawn from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau database of aviation occurrences, and included weather-related accidents, incidents, and 'normal operations.' Results: There were few significant differences between the three weather-related behavior groups in terms of pilot demographics, aircraft characteristics, geographic or environmental factors, or absolute flight distances. The pattern of relative flight distances (a psychological construct) was markedly different for the three groups, with pilots in the weather avoidance group being distinguished by taking timely action. Discussion: The relative distance results suggest that the mid-point of the flight can be a 'psychological turning point' for pilots, irrespective of the absolute flight distance involved. Hence, pilots' behavior was sometimes influenced by psychological factors not related to any particular operational aspect of the flight. The results of the weather avoidance group indicate that a safe pilot is a proactive pilot. Dealing with adverse weather is not a one-off decision but a continually evolving process. This aspect is discussed in terms of the concept of 'mindfulness'.

Background: A significant number of fatal general aviation (GA) accidents are attributable to pilots flying into instrument meteorological conditions without the necessary certification for safe operation. Even when takeoff conditions are clear, they can degrade in flight. Pilots might consult in-flight\xa0 weather technologies to inform flight-plan-related decisions. Method: GA pilots flew 2 scenarios in FTDs while receiving weather notifications (referred to here as alerts) via complex graphical or smart-watch-based visual displays and under different vibrotactile cuing conditions. In-flight testing examined if vibrotactile cuing effects found in simulation were present in real flight. Results: Results suggest the quality and timeliness of weather-related flight decisions and flight-related SA are better supported when displays use vibrotactile cues and embed alert text within maps rather than present it separately on a smart watch. In-flight data confirmed that pilots can reliably perceive vibrotactile cues in real aircraft. Conclusion: Vibrotactile cues improve the reception of notifications and can reduce cognitive demands while flying. Visual weather information should be displayed on larger screens that are positioned to reduce pilots’ postural reorientation. These findings can inform the design of weather technologies for supporting pilot in-flight decision making. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Preflight risk assessment for improved safety in Helicopter Emergency Medical Service operations</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Adverse weather and poor visual cues are common elements in night-time Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) operations contributing to spatial disorientation and fatal accidents. Pilots are required to make weather-related preflight risk assessments to accept or reject a flight. This study's aim was to develop predictive risk assessment tools based on historical accident data to assist the decision-making process. METHODS: We analyzed 32 single-pilot HEMS night-time visual flight rules fatal accidents to identify contributory risk factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop prediction nomograms for nonvisual meteorological conditions (non-VMC), cause and nonsurvivable accidents as dependent variables. Risk factors such as temperature dew point spread, elevation difference, and years of HEMS pilot experience, were entered as continuous variables. Flight crew composition, pilot DTE (domain task experience) and flight rule capability, primary missions, and temperature dew point spread were entered as categorical variables. A point scoring matrix transposed model probability to likelihood and consequence severity. RESULTS: The nomograms correctly predicted the likelihood of entering non-VMC, accident cause, and sustaining a nonsurvivable accident in 75%, 55%, and 94% of cases, respectively. Using data from a recent nonsurvivable HEMS accident, the nomogram estimated a 92% probability (Very Likely) of nonsurvivable accident if visual cues were lost. CONCLUSION: These nomograms can provide preflight information to predict the likelihood of adverse safety outcomes occurring during a planned HEMS mission. While further development work is needed, this approach has the potential to improve HEMS operational safety. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>""]"

Furthermore, depressive symptoms were hypothesized as a mediator between psychosocial work climate and presenteeism. Background: Sickness presenteeism is common among several occupational groups, pilots included. Inappropriate presenteeism, attending work despite feeling inappropriate for reasons other than physical ones, is also prevalent among pilots, even though they are obligated not to work in mentally or physically unfit states. Research has focused on finding risk and protective factors for the act of attending work while ill, as this is associated with both health and safety hazards to employees and organizations. Nonetheless, research on antecedents to pilot sickness and inappropriate presenteeism is scarce. Method: Data from an online self-report questionnaire targeting Swedish Commercial Airline pilots (N = 1128) was analyzed. The questionnaire covered demographics, work conditions (e.g., employment type), perceived psychosocial work climate (e.g., job demands), and depressive symptoms. Results: All psychosocial work factors were associated with both sickness and inappropriate presenteeism. Depressive symptoms acted as a partial mediator between psychosocial work climate and presenteeism. Being directly or atypically employed showed no significant relationship with inappropriate or sickness presenteeism. Conclusion: Perceived psychosocial work factors could transcend the significance of objective working conditions in explaining presenteeism among pilots. This highlights the importance of examining experienced psychosocial work climate regularly to mitigate the risk of presenteeism and, thus, organizational exposure to accidents and errors. © 2022 The Authors</abstract>', '<title>Factors associated with approaching Pilot Peer Support: a cross-sectional study</title> <abstract>Background: Pilot Peer Support Programs (PPSP) have been introduced in Europe as a measure to facilitate commercial pilots’ mental health help-seeking in a confidential and non-punitive manner. However, research is scarce regarding what promotes and prevents pilots from approaching PPSP. Aims: To investigate if, and in which way, different organizational and individual factors are associated with pilots’ attitudes towards approaching PPSP, and to examine the prevalence of possible cases of depression and anxiety disorders among commercial pilots in Europe. Methods: Data were collected using an anonymous web-based survey (n = 4494), covering pilots’ work conditions, health and flight safety. Logistic regression was used to determine the impact of objective and psychosocial work environment factors, mental health factors, and demographic factors. Results: Key findings were that just culture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97, 3.56), type of employment (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.46, 0.78), minimum guaranteed pay (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.48, 2.65), and symptoms of depression (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.50, 0.76) and anxiety (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54, 0.80) significantly predicted pilots’ attitude towards approaching PPSP. The prevalence of pilots scoring above threshold for possible depression (18%) and anxiety disorders (23%) were determined. Conclusions: Pilot Peer Support in its current form appears to be an insufficient means to facilitate pilots’ mental health help-seeking, but could have an important preventive purpose. The findings could assist authorities and operators in developing measures to facilitate pilots’ help-seeking, and improve mental health and flight safety. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract>', '<title>Unraveling the complex relationships between mental health and safety operation behaviors among pilots: a network and latent profile analysis</title> <abstract>As the guardians of aviation safety, pilots’ mental health is critical for ensuring flight safety. However, systematic research on the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots remains scarce, and the relationship between these symptoms and safety operation behaviors is unclear. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the interrelations among mental symptoms in pilots and to explore how these symptoms are associated with safety operation behaviors. A total of 612 male commercial pilots participated in a cross-sectional survey that assessed nine types of mental symptoms and safety operation behaviors. Descriptive statistics, network analysis, and latent profile analysis were utilized to examine their relationships systematically. The study revealed significant interconnections among mental symptoms in pilots, with obsessive-compulsive symptoms playing a pivotal role in the comorbidity network. Pilots were categorized into three groups based on symptom severity: high-, medium-, and low-level symptom groups. Pilots in the high-level symptom group exhibited significantly poorer safety operation behaviors. Nearly half of the mental symptoms are indirectly linked to safety operation behaviors through comorbidities, and these comorbidities have a direct association with these behaviors. In the low-level symptom group, there was greater integration among safety operation behaviors, whereas the high-level symptom group showed dissociation. In the high-level symptom group, interpersonal communication and cooperation played a key role, while the role of understanding the automated system was weaker, which may be related to compensation mechanisms, automation bias, and blind reliance. This study systematically analyzed the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots and their complex relationship with safety operation behaviors. The findings provide practical insights for airline management to promote pilots’ mental health and enhance aviation safety protocols. Additionally, the study contributes to aviation psychology and safety research by offering evidence-based recommendations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2026.</abstract>', '<title>Airplane pilot mental health and suicidal thoughts: a cross-sectional descriptive study via anonymous web-based survey</title> <abstract>Background: The Germanwings Flight 9525 crash has brought the sensitive subject of airline pilot mental health to the forefront in aviation. Globally, 350 million people suffer from depression-a common mental disorder. This study provides further information on this important topic regarding mental health especially among female airline pilots. This is the first study to describe airline pilot mental health-with a focus on depression and suicidal thoughts-outside of the information derived from aircraft accident investigations, regulated health examinations, or identifiable self-reports, which are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline companies. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study via an anonymous web-based survey administered between April and December 2015. Pilots were recruited from unions, airline companies, and airports via convenience sampling. Data analysis included calculating absolute number and prevalence of health characteristics and depression scores. Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty seven (52.7%) of the 3485 surveyed pilots completed the survey, with 1866 (53.5%) completing at least half of the survey. 233 (12.6%) of 1848 airline pilots responding to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and 193 (13.5%) of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold-PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10. Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks. We found a significant trend in proportions of depression at higher levels of use of sleep-aid medication (trend test z = 6.74, p < 0.001) and among those experiencing sexual harassment (z = 3.18, p = 0.001) or verbal harassment (z = 6.13, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Hundreds of pilots currently flying are managing depressive symptoms perhaps without the possibility of treatment due to the fear of negative career impacts. This study found 233 (12.6%) airline pilots meeting depression threshold and 75 (4.1%) pilots reporting having suicidal thoughts. Although results have limited generalizability, there are a significant number of active pilots suffering from depressive symptoms. We recommend airline organizations increase support for preventative mental health treatment. Future research will evaluate additional risk factors of depression such as sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. © 2016 The Author(s)</abstract>', ""<title>Development and validation of a prediction model for the\xa0depressive symptom risk in commercial airline pilots</title> <abstract>Background/aims: Shift workers, such as medical personnel, and pilots, are facing an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms significantly impact an individual’s quality of life and affect work performance, decision-making abilities, and overall public safety. This study aims to establish a multidimensional depressive symptom prediction model based on a large sample of commercial airline pilots to facilitate early identification, prevention, and personalized intervention strategies. Methods: This population-based study included 11,111 participants, with 7918 pilots in the training set and 3193 pilots in the external validation set. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Physiological, psychological, and lifestyle factors potentially associated with depressive symptom risk were collected. The optimal predictors for model development were selected using the Boruta algorithm combined with the LASSO method, and a nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression to predict depressive symptoms in pilots. The model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and accuracy measures, such as the Brier score and Spiegelhalter z-test. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to assess the model's clinical utility. Results: A total of 7918 pilots were included in the training set and 3193 were included in the external validation set. Five characteristic indicators were selected based on their significance in the prediction of depressive symptom risk: living status, alcohol drinking, family history of mental health disorder, subjective health, and subjective sleep quality. The model showed acceptable overall discrimination (AUC<inf>train</inf> = 0.836, 95%CI 0.818 to 0.854; AUC<inf>validation</inf> = 0.840, 95%CI 0.811 to 0.868) and calibration (Brier score<inf>train</inf> = 0.048; Brier score<inf>validation</inf> = 0.051). The decision curve analysis showed that the net benefit was superior to intervening on all participants or not intervening on all participants. Conclusions: This study provides a reliable tool for early prediction and customized management of depressive symptoms among commercial airline pilots. This approach promotes the development of the field by transitioning from passive mental health care to active mental health prevention, emphasizing personalized prevention strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2025.</abstract>""]"

METHODS: A total of 8 experienced U.S. Army test pilots completed 24 flights across 3 distinct route designs using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Vertical Motion Simulator, with airspeeds ranging from 120 to 240 kn. Analysis focused on EEG Beta/(Alpha + Theta) ratios as indicators of changing cognitive engagement over time. RESULTS: Analyses revealed distinct cognitive engagement patterns across routes: highly variable individual responses in routes with changing navigation demands, more consistent cognitive engagement in systematic route designs, and intermediate variability in mixed-demand routes. Airspeed effects on cognitive engagement became particularly pronounced above 200 kn, though these effects varied significantly by route and individual pilot. Temporal analysis demonstrated evolving patterns of cognitive adaptation, with routes eliciting different progression patterns over extended flight periods. Regression analysis showed that EEG Beta/(Alpha+Theta) values increased significantly during all three routes, with mean increases ranging from 0.0051-0.0146.

High cognitive load and sustained attention may predispose an individual to psychological and physical stress and may result in a lack of performance. Cognitive load monitoring of professionals in high precision fields has gathered significant attention in the current research scenario. The proposed work in continuity has tried to demonstrate the use of two non-invasive physiological sensing modalities viz. galvanic skin response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG) to elucidate effectiveness in picking up differences of two induced cognitive state categories based on machine learning and statistical methods. This paper demonstrates how GSR and PPG signals data can be effectively utilized to examine the shift in cognitive load. The present work proposes the use of general linear chirplet transform (GLCT) to evaluate the time-frequency characteristic of GSR and PPG signals and utilize the statistical features in classification. Random Forest, Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbours demonstrated an accuracy of 92.13%, 88.0%, and 86.13% respectively on a dataset of 20 subjects against an optimized feature set, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for differentiating pre-defined categories of cognitive load. The study shows the potential of GSR and PPG signals attributes and time-frequency representation using GLCT to monitor cognitive load in real-life conditions. The proposed work also indicates the possibility to extend the same to attention-demanding fields such as aviation, medicine, and manufacturing for effective remediation of fatigue periods with increased cognitive demand, which, if sustained, may lead to cognitive decline in the long run. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Workload state classification with automation during simulated air traffic control</title> <abstract>Real-time operator workload assessment and state classification may be useful for decisions about when and how to dynamically apply automation to information processing functions in aviation systems. This research examined multiple cognitive workload measures, including secondary task performance and physiological (cardiac) measures, as inputs to a neural network for operator functional state classification during a simulated air traffic control (ATC) task. Twenty-five participants performed a low-fidelity simulation under manual control or 1 of 4 different forms of automation. Traffic volume was either low (3 aircraft) or high (7 aircraft). Participants also performed a secondary (gauge) monitoring task. Results demonstrated significant effects of traffic volume (workload) on aircraft clearances (p < .01) and trajectory conflicts (p < .01), secondary task performance (p < .01), and subjective ratings of task workload (p < .01). The form of ATC automation affected the number of aircraft collisions (p < .05), secondary task performance (p < .01), and heart rate (HR; p < .01). However, heart rate and heart rate variability measures were not sensitive to the traffic manipulation. Neural network models of controller workload (defined in terms of traffic volume) were developed using the secondary task performance and simple heart rate measure as inputs. The best workload classification accuracy using a genetic algorithm (across all forms of ATC automation) was 64%, comparable to prior work. Additional neural network models of workload for each mode of ATC automation revealed substantial variability in predictive accuracy, based on the characteristics of the automation. Secondary task performance was a highly sensitive indicator of ATC workload, whereas the heart rate measure appeared to operate as a more global indicator of workload. A limited range of cardiac response might be sufficient for the demands of the brain in ATC. The results have applicability to design of future adaptive systems integrating neural-network-based workload state classifiers for multiple forms of automation.

This information could also be used to optimize the design of safer, more efficient work environments that increase motivation and productivity. Methods: The present study explored the feasibility of monitoring electroencephalographic (EEG) indices of engagement and workload acquired unobtrusively and quantified during performance of cognitive tests. EEG was acquired from 80 healthy participants with a wireless sensor headset (F3-F4,C3-C4,Cz-POz,F3-Cz,Fz-C3,Fz-POz) during tasks including: multi-level forward/backward-digit-span, grid-recall, trails, mental-addition, 20-min 3-Choice Vigilance, and image-learning and memory tests. EEG metrics for engagement and workload were calculated for each 1-s of EEG. Results: Across participants, engagement but not workload decreased over the 20-min vigilance test. Engagement and workload were significantly increased during the encoding period of verbal and image-learning and memory tests when compared with the recognition/ recall period. Workload but not engagement increased linearly as level of difficulty increased in forward and backward-digit-span, grid-recall, and mental-addition tests. EEG measures correlated with both subjective and objective performance metrics. Discussion: These data in combination with previous studies suggest that EEG engagement reflects information-gathering, visual processing, and allocation of attention. EEG workload increases with increasing working memory load and during problem solving, integration of information, analytical reasoning, and may be more reflective of executive functions. Inspection of EEG on a second-by-second timescale revealed associations between workload and engagement levels when aligned with specific task events providing preliminary evidence that second-by-second classifications reflect parameters of task performance.

Periods of low cognitive workload may be followed by periods of high cognitive workload and vice versa. During such changing demands, there exists potential for increased error on behalf of the pilots due to periods of boredom or excessive cognitive task demand. To further understand cognitive workload in aviation, the present study involved collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data from ten (10) collegiate aviation students in a live-flight environment in a single-engine aircraft. Each pilot possessed a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate and either FAA class I or class II medical certificate. Each pilot flew a standardized flight profile representing an average instrument flight training sequence. For data analysis, we used four main sub-bands of the recorded EEG signals: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Power spectral density (PSD) and log energy entropy of each sub-band across 20 electrodes were computed and subjected to two feature selection algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE) and lasso cross-validation (LassoCV), and a stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm composed of support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Also, hyperparameter optimization and tenfold cross-validation were used to improve the model performance, reliability, and generalization. The feature selection step resulted in 15 features that can be considered an indicator of pilots' cognitive workload states. Then these features were applied to the stacking ensemble algorithm, and the highest results were achieved using the selected features by the RFE algorithm with an accuracy of 91.67% (± 0.11), a precision of 93.89% (± 0.09), recall of 91.67% (± 0.11), F-score of 91.22% (± 0.12), and the mean ROC-AUC of 0.93 (± 0.06). The achieved results indicated that the combination of PSD and log energy entropy, along with well-designed machine learning algorithms, suggest the potential for the use of EEG to discriminate periods of the low, medium, and high workload to augment aircraft system design, including flight automation features to improve aviation safety. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract>""]"

Symptoms are beyond voluntary control and may lead patients to avoid flying and seek medical advice. Methods: Of 1101 psychiatric files from our institute for 1985-2002, 1 50 represented cases of fliers who suffered from phobic fear of flying. Data collected from those files included assessment of fear-evoking situations, type of aircraft, class of aircrew duties, aircraft accident history, past medical history, age, and associated psychiatric comorbidity. Results: We compared a group of 56 pilots with 94 other aircrew members. Results included 143 cases of flight phobia behavior and 7 cases of anxiety about parachuting. Flight phobia was less frequent among pilots (37.4%) than the other aircrew members (62.6%). We found a history of aircraft accident to the patient or an acquaintance in 25% of the cases. Observed comorbid psychiatric disorders (54%) consisted of depressive disorders (22%), anxiety disorders (16%), and personality disorders (7.4%). Fixed-wing pilots and aircrews members had a higher incidence of depression than did rotary-wing pilots and crew-members (p < 0.05). Rotary-wing pilots and crewmembers had a higher rate of anxiety disorders (p < 0.05). Discussion: Flight phobia encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical origins that may lead pilots or other aircrew members to refuse to fly.

Background: The FAS measures the anxiety levels in different flight situations, while FAM assesses the somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety or anticipatory anxiety in different flight situations. The FAS and the FAM have been adapted to different cultures and used in different studies. Method: 645 adults from different regions of Turkey participated in this study (M<inf>age</inf> = 25.58, SD<inf>age</inf> = 10.43, 59.2% women). A Socio-demographic Information Form, the Visual Analog Flight Anxiety Scale (VAFAS), the FAS, the FAM and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used for data collection. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed that the Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM had similar factor structures to the original forms. The FAS consisted of three factors and the FAM consisted of two factors with factor loadings between.56 and.85. High Cronbach’s alpha scores (.78–.97) of the FAS, the FAM and their subscales supported internal consistency reliability. Convergent and discriminant validity of the scales were supported with correlation analysis and independent samples t-test. Conclusion: The Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM provided psychometrically sound self-report measures of flight anxiety.

External factors like cabin design and environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure, noise, and vibration) interact with individual characteristics (anxiety traits, fear of fl ying, and personality) from arrival at the airport to landing at the destination. In this study, we investigated the infl uence of space and motion discomfort (SMD), fear of heights, and anxiety on comfort perception during all phases of air travel. Methods: We evaluated 51 frequent air travelers through a modifi ed version of the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (FAS), in which new items were added and where the subjects were asked to report their level of discomfort or anxiety (not fear) for each phase of air travel (Chronbach ' s alpha 5 0.974). Correlations were investigated among these scales: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Cohen ' s Acrophobia Questionnaire, and the Situational Characteristics Questionnaire (SitQ, designed to estimate SMD levels). Results: Scores of SitQ correlated with discomfort in situations involving space and movement perception (Pearson ' s rho 5 0.311), while discomfort was associated with cognitive mechanisms related to scores in the anxiety scales (Pearson ' s rho 5 0.375). Anxiety traits were important determinants of comfort perception before and after fl ight, while the infl uence of SMD was more signifi cant during the time spent in the aircraft cabin. Discussion: SMD seems to be an important modulator of comfort perception in air travel. Its infl uence on physical well being and probably on cognitive performance, with possible effects on fl ight safety, deserves further investigation. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", ""<title>A novel treatment of fear of flying using a large virtual reality system</title> <abstract>Background: Fear of flying (FoF), a common phobia in the developed world, is usually treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, most efficiently when combined with exposure methods, e.g., virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). We evaluated FoF treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements simulating, e.g., takeoff, landing, and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli were also incorporated. Case Report: Three male patients with FoF underwent a clinical interview followed by three VRETs in the presence and with the guidance of a therapist. Scores on the Flight Anxiety Situation (FAS) and Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires were obtained on the first and fourth visits. Anxiety levels were assessed using the subjective units of distress (SUDs) scale during the exposure. All three subjects expressed satisfaction regarding the procedure and did not skip or avoid any of its stages. Consistent improvement was seen in the SUDs throughout the VRET session and across sessions, while patients ' scores on the FAS and FAM showed inconsistent trends. Two patients participated in actual flights in the months following the treatment, bringing 12 and 16 yr of avoidance to an end. Discussion: This VR-based treatment includes critical elements for exposure of flying experience beyond visual and auditory stimuli. The current case reports suggest VRET sessions may have a meaningful impact on anxiety levels, yet additional research seems warranted. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", '<title>Does yohimbine hydrochloride facilitate fear extinction in virtual reality treatment of fear of flying? a randomized placebo-controlled trial</title> <abstract>Background: Research suggests that yohimbine hydrochloride (YOH), a noradrenaline agonist, can facilitate fear extinction. It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is stimulated through elevated noradrenaline levels. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the potential exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in a clinical sample of participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for a specific phobia (fear of flying). Methods: Sixty-seven participants with fear of flying were randomized to 4 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) combined with YOH (10 mg), or 4 sessions of VRET combined with a placebo. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour exposure sessions consisting of two 25-minute virtual flights. At pre-and post-treatment, fear of flying was assessed. The YOH or placebo capsules were administered 1 h prior to exposures. The manipulation of the noradrenaline activity was confirmed by salivary α-amylase (sAA) samples taken pre-, during and post-exposure. Results: Forty-eight participants completed treatment. Manipulation of noradrenaline levels with YOH was successful, with significantly higher levels of sAA in the YOH group when entering exposure. Results showed that both groups improved significantly from pre-to post-treatment with respect to anxiety reduction. However, although the manipulation of noradrenaline activity was successful, there was no evidence that YOH enhanced outcome. Conclusions: Participants improved significantly on anxiety measures independently of drug condition, after 4 sessions of VRET. These data do not support the initial findings of exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in this dosage in clinical populations. © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.</abstract>']"

A study was conducted to determine if SA in U.S. Air Force F-15 pilots could be predicted. The participants were 171 active duty F-15 A/C pilots who completed a test battery representative of various psychological constructs proposed or demonstrated to be valid for the prediction of performance in a wide variety of military and civilian jobs. These predictors encompassed measures of cognitive ability, psychomotor ability, and personality. Supervisor and peer ratings of SA were collected. Supervisors and peers showed substantial agreement on the SA ratings of the pilots. The first unrotated principle component extracted from the supervisor and peer ratings accounted for 92.5% of the variability of ratings. The unrotated first principal component served as the SA criterion. Flying experience measured in number of F-15 hours was the best predictor of SA. After controlling for the effects of F-15 flying hours, the measures of general cognitive ability based on working memory, spatial reasoning, and divided attention were found to be predictive of SA. Psychomotor and personality measures were not predictive. With additional F-15 flying hours it is expected that pilots would improve their ratings of SA.</abstract>', ""<title>Dimensions of air traffic control tower information needs: From information requests to display design</title> <abstract>In an effort to determine the information needs of tower air traffic controllers, instructors from the Federal Aviation Administration's Academy in Oklahoma City were asked to control traffic in a high-fidelity tower cab simulator. Information requests were made apparent by eliminating access to standard tower information sources. Instead, controllers were required to ask for precisely the information they needed during the scenarios. The information requests were classified using an elaboration of Zwaan and Radvansky's (1998) dimensions of situation models. The vast majority of requests were about three of the dimensions originally developed for reading comprehension: the protagonist, intentionality, and space. The information requests were also classified into 28 operational categories (e.g., aircraft identification, destination). From these results, the data were summarized, not just statistically, but by the creation of display-hypotheses. The display-hypotheses were organized according to the situation-model dimensions. Controllers preferred data blocks organized by the situation-model principle over those that violated this organization. The summary display-hypotheses were quite simple and accounted for the vast majority of the information requests controllers made. The display-hypotheses accounted for the information needs of controllers during routine as well as off-nominal events. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"", ""<title>Securing future ATM-concepts' safety by measuring situation awaerness in ATC</title> <abstract>A radical change in air traffic management (ATM) is required. New concepts implemented with a view to increasing capacity and efficiency should at least be safety-neutral. Because of the enormous impact of the introduction of new air traffic management systems, their basic concepts have to be evaluated prospectively. With the increasing automation during the nineties, the concept of situation awareness (SA) became accepted as a potential indicator for safety. Among the considerable number of methods that have been developed to measure SA, no method has been validated or applied to evaluate future ATM-concepts like the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The approach of SAGAT is based on the assumption that the set of task environments' elements that are relevant for SA is independent of the dynamics within the task environment. Empirical evidence was found that this assumption can not be held in the ATC-domain. A new method to measure SA in ATC, called SALSA, has been developed. This measure takes into account that air traffic controllers use an event based mental representation of the air traffic. The SALSA and the SAGAT SA-measure have been compared in an evaluation study of a new ATM-concept. Results indicate that the method SALSA is feasible and more suitable than SAGAT to evaluate prospectively future ATM-concepts with regards to their impact on safety. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

In Study 1, the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire and the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire were administered to 547 individuals in age groups from 7–8 to 50 + years of age. Significant increases in imagery vividness were found in females at 8–9 and in males at 10–11 years. In general females report more vivid imagery than males but at about 50 females' movement imagery reduced in vividness. In Studies 2–5 imagery differences in specialist groups were examined using the same two questionnaires with a total of 655 participants. In Study 2, children aged 7–15 years with poor movement control were found to be extremely poor imagers with 42 per cent reporting no imagery at all. In Study 3, physical education students reported more vivid imagery than students specializing in physics, English, and surveying.

Such an assessment is significant for controller training and remote tower system design. This study employed the SART scale to compare controllers’ SA scores in traditional and remote tower environments. Results revealed significant differences, especially in attention demand and situational understanding. Subsequently, a quantitative analysis of controllers’ perception, understanding, and decision-making abilities was conducted, integrating subjective and objective data. Eye-tracking, heart rate, working memory scales, and communication-coordination scales showed significant results. Experienced controllers had better psychological safety skills, while trainees were more likely to increase vigilance. Moreover, a series of sensitive SA indicators were identified. An evaluation index system was established using the entropy weight method. By calculating the Euclidean distance, Gray relational degree, and comprehensive proximity coefficient, the SA levels of controllers were comprehensively evaluated. The top five important indicators were average blink rate, scan length, average fixation duration, fixation duration, and average pupil diameter.

One major reason for this is that women and minorities have less aviation-related background experience. In response to this need the '150' Predevelopmental program was begun to give those selected for the program a 1-year orientation to aviation and air traffic control prior to FAA Academy training. The purpose of this research was to study the unique relationship between Predevelopmental training and Academy success. Since random selection and/or assignment of subjects to the Predevelopmental program is not feasible and a matching control group was not available, traditional research methods and statistical analyses were not appropriate. Consequently, path analysis was employed where derived significant relationships were considered simultaneously to determine the unique relationship between Predevelopment training and Academy success. The path models indicated that Predevelopmental training overall does significantly enhance a trainee's potential for Academy success with a possible differential effect according to minority status.

All trainees completed the nonradar laboratory portion of the training and, in addition, completed a preemployment questionnaire. Based on responses to the questionnaire, the trainees were assigned to one of three experience groups, corresponding to groups given credit for experience using Civil Service Commission (CSC) selection procedures. It was found that the OKT was highly correlated with experience (r=0.64) and, in addition, had a higher correlation with successful completion of the nonradar lab than did experience (r = 0.25 vs. 0.12).

The STPI was administered to students who entered the FAA Academy between June 1984 and September 1985. Academy test scores were obtained for 1,790 students in the en route option.

Statistical analyses determined the relationships between ATCS student scores on the STPI measures and a) normative data and b) Academy screening and field training results. ATCS students reported significantly lower state (current level) and trait (proneness) levels of anxiety than did either college students or military recruits. Trainees who had relatively high scores (for ATCSs) on a combined index of the trait and state measures of anxiety exhibited significantly higher a) percentages of Academy failures/withdrawals, b) percentages of option switchers in the field, and c) overall field attrition, than did trainees with low scores.

Method: Study 1 examined the validity of the operational selection test (i.e., Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or ASVAB) against apprentice-level training performance. Study 2 evaluated the impact of alternative selection procedures on training attrition and eligibility for training. Study 3 reviewed the results of a survey of enlisted ATCs designed to identify the personnel characteristics and organizational factors that influence training and job performance. Discussion: The current selection composite demonstrated acceptable validity for predicting apprentice-level training performance. Alternative cut-score analyses revealed that raising the minimum qualifying score in order to reduce attrition by 5% would lead to an unacceptable 20% reduction in the number of eligible ATC candidates. Using a different ASVAB composite for selection would have less overall impact on the qualification rate, but would disproportionally disqualify women. Results of a survey of enlisted ATCs indicated they were generally satisfied and motivated. In addition, they identified several abilities required for on-the-job performance that are not measured by current USAF selection methods. These included memorization and retention of new information, spatial orientation/visualization, ability to work well in stressful environments, ability to shift between two or more sources of information, and ability to combine and organize information.

The primary objective of this study was to identify the physiological, psychological, or demographical characteristics associated with successful progression through the CCT pipeline program. A battery of physiological measurements, biographical information, and psychological tests were used to determine the profile of a successful CCT trainee. These measures were chosen on the basis of being standard physical fitness parameters, CCT-specific physical attribute indicators or validated psychological surveys. A multiple of physical tests served as measurements for cardiovascular endurance (VO2max and running economy), ?anaerobic? capacity (Wingate power and loaded anaerobic endurance treadmill tests), body composition skinfolds measurements, power (Wingate and vertical jump), and reaction time (Makoto eye-hand test.) Each test was conducted using a standardized protocol. Psychological characteristics were explored through use of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP-NEO) and the Mental Toughness Questionnaire 48 (MTQ 48). Our findings revealed the following mean characteristics of 109 CCTs who completed Phase I of the pipeline and achieved their 3-level rating: 23 years old, 1.8m tall, 81 kg, 12% body fat, VO2max of 59 ml/kg/min, vertical jump of 62 cm, able to generate 11.4 W/kg peak power and 9.3 W/Kg mean power during Wingate tests, overall mental toughness rating of 8 (out of 10) with high levels of extraversion and conscientiousness and low levels of neuroticism. The most popular competitive sport played in high school was football, followed by track, wrestling, and baseball. The results of the investigation confirm that CCT trainees who have achieved a 3-level rating possess much higher than average levels of aerobic and anaerobic fitness, power, mental toughness, extraversion and conscientiousness. They possess lower than average levels of neuroticism and openness to experience. These results may prove useful in refining the selection criteria and in designing training for CCT trainees. 2011.</abstract>']"

The Quick coherence technique (QCT) is an effective intervention tool to improve stress resilience and psychophysiological balance based on a five-minute paced breathing exercise with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback. The current research reports on the application of QCT training within an international airline to improve commercial pilots’ psychological health and support cognitive functions. Forty-four commercial pilots volunteered in a one-month training programme to practise self-regulated QCT in day-to-day life and flight operations. Pilots’ stress index, HRV time-domain and frequency-domain parameters were collected to examine the influence of QCT practice on the stress resilience process. The results demonstrated that the QCT improved psychophysiological indicators associated with stress resilience and cognitive functions, in both day-to-day life and flight operation settings. HRV fluctuations, as measured through changes in RMSSD and LF/HF, revealed that the resilience processes were primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activities that are important in promoting pilots’ energy mobilization and cognitive functions, thus QCT has huge potential in facilitating flight performance and aviation safety. These findings provide scientific evidence for implementing QCT as an effective mental support programme and controlled rest strategy to improve pilots’ psychological health, stress management, and operational performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

The attitude indicator (AI) is crucial for pilots to maintain spatial orientation. This study aims to investigate pilot performance with the original and a modified AI under stress and nonstress conditions. METHODS: T here were 52 pilots recruited and divided into a control group and a stress group. The stress group underwent the Trier Social Stress Test to induce acute stress, while the control group performed a nonstress task. Both groups then completed flight attitude recovery tasks using the original and a modified AI. The modified AI featured two white bars added around the original AI to enhance the display of the aircraft’s attitude. RESULTS: T he stress group exhibited significantly higher heart rates (88.01 ± 14.03 bpm) and subjective anxiety scores (35.82 ± 9.41) compared to the control group (83.22 ± 6.57 bpm; 32.26 ± 5.81). In the control group, accuracy with the modified AI (94.9% ± 5.1%) was significantly higher than with the original AI (91.8% ± 6.6%). Additionally, the modified AI reduced pitch reversal errors and roll reversal errors. In the stress group, the modified AI increased accuracy for smaller initial pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. DISCUSSION: T he addition of visual cues in the periphery of the AI improved performance under nonstressed conditions. Under stress, the visual cues enhanced accuracy for smaller pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. These findings provide insights for the ergonomic design of cockpit instruments. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Comparison of myocardial ischemia during intense mental stress using flight simulation in airline pilots with coronary artery disease to that produced with conventional mental and treadmill exercise stress testing</title> <abstract>Mental stress increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although laboratory mental stress often causes less myocardial ischemia than exercise stress (ES), it is unclear whether mental stress is intrinsically different or differences are due to less hemodynamic stress with mental stress. We sought to evaluate the hemodynamic and ischemic response to intense realistic mental stress created by modern flight simulators and compare this response to that of exercise treadmill testing and conventional laboratory mental stress (CMS) testing in pilots with coronary disease. Sixteen airline pilots with angiographically documented coronary disease and documented myocardial ischemia during ES were studied using maximal treadmill ES, CMS, and aviation mental stress (AMS) testing. AMS testing was done in a sophisticated simulator using multiple system failures as stressors. Treadmill ES testing resulted in the highest heart rate, but AMS caused a higher blood pressure response than CMS. Maximal ratepressure product was not significantly different between ES and AMS (25,646 vs 23,347, p = 0.08), although these were higher than CMS (16,336, p <0.0001). Despite similar hemodynamic stress induced by ES and AMS, AMS resulted in significantly less ST-segment depression and nuclear ischemia than ES. Differences in induction of ischemia by mental stress compared to ES do not appear to be due to the creation of less hemodynamic stress. In conclusion, even with equivalent hemodynamic stress, intense realistic mental stress induced by flight simulators results in significantly less myocardial ischemia than ES as measured by ST-segment depression and nuclear ischemia. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of acute stress on instrument-based tasks remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of acute stress on subjects’ performance in two crucial tasks: the attitude recovery task and the landing judgment task. METHODS: A total of 91 student pilots were divided into a control group and a stress group. Both groups completed a square task, with the stress group exposed to high-intensity noise to induce acute stress. Subsequently, 42 subjects performed an attitude recovery task using two formats of the attitude indicator: moving horizon and moving aircraft. The remaining 49 subjects performed a landing judgment task with three complexity levels using a landing instrument. Heart rates, trait-state anxiety scores, response times, and accuracy of the tasks were analyzed. RESULTS: Heart rates and state anxiety scores increased following stress induction. In the attitude task, the stress group responded faster than the control group in the moving-horizon format (467.55 ms vs. 491.45 ms) but had lower accuracy (98.65% vs. 99.73%). In the moving-aircraft format, response times (stress: 454.15 ms, control: 474.73 ms) and accuracy (stress: 98.55%, control: 99.38%) showed no significant differences between the two groups. In the low-complexity landing task, the stress group (1015.79 ms) responded faster than the control group (1168.17 ms). DISCUSSION: The impact of acute stress on performance depends on task complexity and stress intensity. While stress impairs performance in complex tasks by increasing errors, it enhances performance in simpler tasks by accelerating responses without compromising accuracy. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal.

RESULTS: Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (20.59, 20.52, and 0.32 mS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline (Δ = 1.2 and Δ = 1.1 points), but the control scene did not (Δ = 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect (Δ = 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene (Δ = 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).

Spatial disorientation accounts for 20-38% of fatal military aviation accidents, but case reports describing specific illusions during actual flight are rare. CASE REPORT: On a clear night, an aerial refueling tanker was cruising at 16,000 ft (4877 m), while an F-15I fighter aircraft was 3 mi behind and 971 ft (296 m) below. About 100 s before a near collision, the fighter pilot switched to Air-to-Air mode, displaying the distance and speed difference to the tanker via a Target Designator box on the Head-Up Display. However, the crew did not realize they were accelerating toward the tanker [from 597-663 ft · s-1 (182-202 m · s-1)] or climbing by 738 ft (225 m). The two aircraft came within 49 ft (15 m) of each other before the navigator noticed the tanker and initiated a roll to the left. DISCUSSION: The dip illusion occurs when a pilot flying in trail attempts to maintain the image of the lead aircraft in a fixed position on the windscreen as separation increases, which can lead to unintentional descent. In this case, we propose a ""reverse-dip"" illusion. The fighter crew was unaware they were closing in on the tanker, causing the Target Designator box to rise in the Head-Up Display. The pilot instinctively pulled back on the stick to maintain the box\'s position, resulting in an unintentional climb. Recognizing how such illusions develop in flight is essential to reducing future risks. Nakdimon I, Gordon B. Spatial disorientation event during flight due to proposed reverse-dip visual illusion.

To systematically understand the impact of SD, it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze pilots’ flight performance and mental stress, and to verify the effectiveness of verbal reports (VR) in enabling pilots to deal with an SD situation. This study investigated the effects of VR execution and type of SD on flight performance and mental stress. METHODS: SD simulation experiments were conducted on 30 Air Force fighter pilots (15 in the VR group and 15 in the non-VR group) with electrocardiography (ECG) sensors attached. The pilots gave their VRs by immediately verbalizing their attention to instrument information and six potentially disorientating scenarios were implemented in each flight phase. Flight performance was analyzed using instructor evaluation and self-evaluation scores, and mental stress was measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and perceived distress score. RESULTS: In maintaining flight performance, the VR group, respectively, had 8% and 10% higher scores for altitude and speed than the non-VR group. The self-evaluation scores were lowest for Coriolis, while Graveyard Spin was scored lowest in the instructor evaluations. Regarding mental stress, the VR group tended to have higher HFs and lower LF/HF ratios among HRV measures than the non-VR group, and an 11% lower perceived distress score. The highest perceived distress score was for Coriolis.

It was assumed that visual illusion tends to cause spatial disorientation (SD). The question was asked which orientation of the sloping cloud (right/left) would have a bigger impact on SD. The effectiveness of the flight profile performance under the influence of visual illusion was analyzed in the context of the field dependence (FD), field independence (FI) or field intermediate dependence (FINT) of perception, the effectiveness of attention and operational memory. Material and Methods: The study covered 66 pilots. A flight simulator was used as a measure of effectiveness in performing the flight profile in spatial disorientation conditions. The effectiveness of attention and working memory was diagnosed using 4 computer tasks. Results: It was revealed that the right sloping cloud (compared to the left sloping cloud) had a greater impact on military pilots’ behavior. The cognitive style distinguishes the accuracy of the flight profile performance from the inclined cloud pointing to the right. The comparisons showed significant differences between the FI and FD pilot groups. All the pilots demonstrated the right-sided asymmetry of the flight rate. While performing tasks on the simulator, the FI pilots were characterized by a more stable rate than the FINT pilots. Conclusions: A general conclusion is that the “correct falling cloud” had a greater impact on pilots’ behavior. The presented results confirm the hypothesis that susceptibility to visual illusions is significantly increased in the pilots characterized by field dependence while the pilots with the FINT style of perception are characterized by a greater variability of the flight rate. © 2019 Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

Background: SD frequently occurs in military rotary-wing operations and often contributes to mishaps. Effects of SD stimuli on pilots are usually quantified using control errors, but effects on cognition have not yet been successfully quantified. Method: Military helicopter pilots (n = 14) performed scenarios with six SD stimuli (SD condition) and six corresponding control stimuli (NoSD condition) in a motion-base simulator with integrated virtual reality headset. SD stimuli were: false horizon, featureless terrain, leans, brownout, a somatogyral yaw illusion, and loss of horizon due to night vision goggles (NVGs). Mental workload was measured using auditory arithmetic task performance and attentional focus was measured using eye-tracking. Results: Average arithmetic task performance was significantly impaired, and proportional gaze dwell time on the attitude indicator was significantly increased in the SD compared to the NoSD condition. Of the six SD stimuli, the featureless terrain, the leans, and the brownout induced significant effects on performance, whereas the featureless terrain, brownout, and false horizon significantly affected gaze behavior. The NVGs and somatogyral yaw stimuli did not induce significant effects. Pilots’ self-reports indicated awareness of all SD stimuli, except for the featureless terrain. Conclusion: The results indicate that SD impacts pilot mental workload and attentional focus. Application: Modern military aircraft present a large volume of mission-related information to pilots. This study shows that SD stimuli may negatively impact the processing of such information. © 2025 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Background: Flight attendants in the airline industry have a differentiated work environment in stressful and demanding situations. The literature has highlighted the prevalence of mental health disorders among flight attendants. Methods: Non-experimental, quantitative research findings from a sample of 384 flight attendants from five airlines in Iran, based on structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, provide support for the hypotheses. Results: The SEM findings revealed that both PsyCap and organizational justice can enhance flight attendant mental health. As expected, mental health improved job performance. Consistent with the study’s predictions, mental health mediated the effects of PsyCap and organizational justice on job performance. Conclusions: This study empirically linked PsyCap and organizational justice to flight attendant perceptions of mental health and job performance.

These findings have theoretical and practical implications. This research contributes to the extant literature by empirically validating the mediating effect of mental health and clarifying the role of two types of individual psychological job resources on flight attendant performance. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Does trust in organization mediate the influence of servant leadership on satisfaction outcomes among flight attendants?</title> <abstract>Purpose: Drawing from servant leadership (SL) and social exchange theories, our study investigates trust in organization (TIO) as a mediator of the impact of SL on job, career and life satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: A time-lagged survey design was used to gather data from flight attendants in Turkey. Structural equation modeling was used as the main analytic tool to assess these relationships. Findings: The relationships proposed in the authors’ study receive full support from the empirical data. Specifically, TIO is one of the immediate outcomes of SL that engenders job, career and life satisfaction at elevated levels. The results highlight the impacts of job and career satisfaction in the intermediate linkage between SL and life satisfaction. Practical implications: Management should train managerial employees to enhance the understanding of SL, which boosts flight attendants’ TIO. Management should invest in human resources through training and empowerment. This makes flight attendants perceive that management does not violate psychological contract. Such employees develop TIO that in turn engenders higher job, career and life satisfaction. It is also important to reward servant leaders when they succeed in making flight attendants develop TIO and motivating them to have higher job performance. Originality/value: Little is known about the consequences of SL in the extant service research. More importantly, there are still calls for research about the variables (e.g. TIO) mediating the relationship between SL and employee satisfaction outcomes. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>Understanding quondam commitments to retain employees: insights from the case of flight attendants and pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: This study aims to examine the process model of quondam commitments (commitments employees used to have, but no longer have). It is part of a new perspective aimed at understanding better the concept of commitment, a powerful determinant of employee retention, by looking at gone commitments. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a qualitative methodology recommended in the most recent commitment literature, life story interviews (Study 1 – flight attendants) and non-directive interviews (Study 2 – pilots) were conducted. Findings: The authors propose a revised process model of quondam commitments, including the possible transformation of a commitment bond into a different type of psychological bond over time. Research limitations/implications: The sample sizes are limited because of the qualitative nature of both studies, and the quondam commitment outcomes could only be studied at the individual level. However, the innovative nature of the work offers important contributions and avenues for research. Practical implications: This study provides concrete perspectives for hospitality professionals to retain employees who question their relationship with work. Its relevance goes beyond the airline sector and can be applied to the hotel or restaurant industry, looking for solutions to deal with massive attrition. Originality/value: This research contributes to filling three gaps identified in the commitment literature. It is one of the very rare studies considering closely both multiple targets and multiple types of psychological bonds. Moreover, it incorporates their dynamics, beyond the commitment bond, and suggests a refined model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>How positive psychological capital promotes service recovery performance through mental health and work engagement: Does service climate matter?</title> <abstract>Purpose – This study aims to examine the contribution of positive psychological capital (PsyCap) to service recovery performance (SRP) through the mediating roles of mental health (MH) and work engagement (WE). Additionally, it considers the moderating role of service climate (SC). Design/methodology/approach – The research utilized a self-report questionnaire completed by a sample of 391 Vietnamese Airlines flight attendants. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings – The results indicated that PsyCap does not directly influence SRP; instead, the effect of PsyCap on SRP is fully mediated by MH and WE. Furthermore, when flight attendants perceive their organization as fostering a favorable service climate, the impact of WE on SRP is strengthened. Practical implications – The author proposes practical strategies to enhance service recovery among Vietnamese Airlines flight attendants. These insights provide valuable information for the sector, empowering decision-makers. Originality/value – This research makes a significant contribution to the limited academic literature on the subject by providing statistical evidence of the relationships among a set of variables. While PsyCap is recognized as a crucial personal resource in service industries, there is a lack of research on its impact within the airline sector. This study highlights the importance of PsyCap for MH, WE, and SRP. Additionally, it addresses the gap in existing literature by demonstrating the moderating role of SC between WE and SRP. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited</abstract>', '<title>Building Sustainable Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Hospitality: Structural Relationships of Rapport, Trust, and Psychological Capital Among Airline Cabin Crew</title> <abstract>This study examines the structural relationships among rapport, trust, psychological capital (PsyCap), and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) in the emotionally demanding work context of airline cabin crews. Grounded in the job demands–resources (JD-R) model and social exchange theory (SET), we propose and test a sequential mediation model in which rapport is positively associated with trust, trust is positively associated with PsyCap, and PsyCap is positively associated with OCB. Based on survey data from 248 South Korean flight attendants, structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrates that rapport is indirectly associated with OCB through the sequential mediation of trust and PsyCap, rather than displaying a significant direct association. The findings indicate that rapport functions not merely as an immediate behavioral driver but as a relational asset that is linked to the psychological capacities essential for sustainable organizational behavior. This study contributes to the theory by integrating JD-R and SET perspectives to explain how relational and psychological resources are jointly related to OCB. While the primary focus was on mediation, future research should test potential moderation effects, such as how job demands or emotional labor may shape the strength of these pathways—aligning with the JD-R model’s interactive assumptions. Practically, the results suggest that airline organizations and other service industries can promote sustainable human resource management by cultivating trust-based relational capital and strengthening employees’ PsyCap through targeted training, mentoring, and supportive leadership practices. These insights extend beyond aviation to other service sectors characterized by high emotional labor demands, offering a pathway to strengthen human resource sustainability and organizational social sustainability. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>']"

Each subject completed two questioning sessions and two working sessions, the first time during a period of low traffic and the second time during a period of high traffic. For the questioning sessions standardized questionnaires were used. For all investigated working sessions, different aspects of the subjective and objective workload were recorded. Before and after each session, a saliva sample for assessing the concentration of secreted cortisol was taken. The questionnaire parameters represented psychological stress symptoms, such as complaints of physical discomfort, depression, negative self-communication, work-increased anxiety, coping behaviour and subjective rating, and interpretation of various aspects of the working situation. The mean values measured were within the normal range, and only a few significant differences between the two questioning sessions were found. However, about 10 to 15% of the ATCs showed elevated values in psychological stress symptoms to an extent indicating that they might have serious stress problems at work and/or in their private life. The investigated working sessions showed that the ATCs’ subjective ratings correspond clearly to their cortisol response and the objective workload. Thus, ATCs’ complaints regarding excess work stress should be taken seriously. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Assessment of Occupational Health and Safety Performance in Air Traffic Control: An Empirical Investigation of Stress and Well-Being</title> <abstract>Air traffic control is widely recognized as one of the most psychologically demanding occupations, where safety and operational performance are tightly interwoven. This study explores the relationship between occupational health and safety (OHS) systems and the psychological well-being of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs), focusing on factors such as perceived safety, job satisfaction, stress, and mental strain. Conducted within the Hellenic Air Navigation Services Provider, the research adopts a cross-sectional design using a structured questionnaire distributed nationwide. The study draws upon the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) theoretical framework to examine how organizational resources, such as training, clarity of role, supervisor support, and employee autonomy, interact with job demands to shape occupational outcomes. Special emphasis is placed on understanding how the presence and awareness of structured OHS systems influence ATCOs’ perceptions of safety and well-being. Our analysis indicated that participants who reported the presence of an OHS system perceived their workplace as significantly safer than those who reported no such system. Hence, the existence of structured measures allows ATCOs to feel confident in their work environment. By assessing a range of psychosocial and organizational variables, this study seeks to contribute to both the academic discourse and practical strategies aimed at improving safety culture and psychological resilience in high-risk work environments. The findings are intended to inform policy development and organizational practices within the air traffic control sector and other safety-critical domains. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>A Mixed-Method Study on Job Satisfaction Among Air Traffic Controllers During the Pandemic: The Roles of Work-Family Interface and Resilience</title> <abstract>Objective: To investigate whether workload is negatively related to job satisfaction, directly and indirectly, via work-family conflict, and conditional on resilience levels. Background: Covid-19 restriction measures severely affected the aviation sector leading air traffic controllers to face periodic fluctuations in air traffic volume. Despite their key role in ensuring the efficiency and safety of air traffic management, little is known about the psychological issues faced by air traffic controllers during the pandemic. Method: A total of 168 Italian air traffic controllers completed an online self-report survey assessing workload, work-family conflict, job satisfaction, resilience, and Covid-19-related experience. Descriptive statistics and moderated mediation analyses were performed. To deepen the quantitative results, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted, and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Workload was positively related to work-family conflict which, in turn, was negatively associated with job satisfaction. Resilience buffered this association. The following six main themes emerged from the interviews: the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; double-edged job characteristics; job-related risk stressors; protective resources; work-life interface; and consequences. Conclusion: Air traffic controllers who were confronted with sudden increases in air traffic volume were more likely to experience work-family conflict and then be less satisfied with their job. However, resilience was a protective factor against lower job satisfaction under high work-family conflict levels. Qualitative results deepened these findings. The practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Research notes/Notes de recherche: Du français dans le del: un conflit en retard</title> <abstract>This paper examines the factors which may account for the timing of the francophone‐anglophone conflict in air traffic control in Quebec in 1975–76.

The objective of this research was to investigate techniques for measuring subjective perceptions of clutter and to model the predicted impacts of clutter on pilot performance within the context of advanced flight deck technologies. Six commercial pilots flew simulated approaches under varied workload conditions with low-, medium-, and high-clutter head-up displays, rating the perceived clutter and subjective mental workload associated with each display configuration. Results revealed that high-clutter displays produced elevated reports of perceived clutter and workload due to information density or redundancy, whereas low-clutter displays were perceived as less cluttered but challenging to use due to lack of relevant information typically used during flight. A multidimensional measure of clutter was found to be more sensitive to display differences than an overall perceived rating of clutter, and low-level visual display properties were successful in predicting clutter perceptions and pilot performance.

Because change blindness is relevant in many applied settings, the current study investigated the phenomenon in the context of tasks performed by naval command and control system personnel. Operators of such systems are often heavily loaded with concurrent visual search, situation assessment, voice communications, and control-display manipulation tasks at large, physically dispersed tactical situation displays. As the operators' attention shifts from one display to another, it creates an opportunity for changes to occur on unattended screens with potentially negative consequences. Our results show that on a display containing 8 objects of interest, considerable change blindness was demonstrated in that participants required 2 or more selections to correctly identify a changed object on nearly 1/3 of the test trials. Further, operator performance on 15% of the trials was equivalent to randomly guessing with replacement after making 3 incorrect selections. This research underscores the need for developing effective countermeasures to the change blindness phenomenon.

Most prior experimentation has involved cognitively demanding tasks, which are known to affect the accommodation response. The simulations have often been unrealistic and involved short working distances. Hypothesis: Over-accommodation is caused not by the presence of a head-up display per se, but rather by the cognitive demand of the task. Methods: The effect of increasing the task cognitive load and the use of forward looking infra-red imagery (FLIR) on the ocular accommodative response and task performance was assessed with a realistic head-up display assisted flying task. FLIR increases cognitive load due to its poor resolution and the need for interpretation of the images. Results: Over- accommodation was found to be small in magnitude (0.17 ± 0.03D; range - 0.02-0.45D) occurring only with cognitively demanding tasks and with forward looking infrared imagery. Response times to detect tanks in the outside world scene were slower with increased cognitive load and forward looking infra- red imagery, along with a reduced detection rate, decreased accuracy of tracking tanks in the outside world and poorer control of the head-up display pitch ladder. When discrimination was added to detection in an outside world task, decisions were delayed until they could be accurately made, rather than performance degraded. Conclusion: The use of a virtual head-up display in a simulated aircraft environment did not adversely affect ocular accommodation. However, increased cognitive demand or FLIR imagery caused significant inward shifts of accommodation.</abstract>', '<title>Peripheral Polar-Graphic Displays for Signal/Failure Detection</title> <abstract>The object of this series of studies was to examine the utility of multivariate polar-graphic iconic displays, placed in the parafoveal or near-peripheral regions of the visual field, for the presentation of multiple indices of subsystem performance in an aircraft system context. Results of the first study suggest that (a) such a display, circumscribed about a primary flight instrument, could be used readily to detect performance deviations that exceeded defined “normal” bounds; and (b) polygons are more effective than polar histograms. The second study was used to examine the hypothesis that the superior performance obtained with polar formats was not merely a function of reductions in visual scanning requirements but stemmed from the organization and symmetry found in the iconic display. In addition, index markings lacking in the first study were added to the polar histogram to determine if these would materially affect speed and accuracy of judgments. Performance using polar histograms in the second study was found superior to that obtained using needle indicators of similar spatial distribution, polar-graphic iconic displays ranking between the other two display types. The results suggest that order of merit of displays may be altered by small format changes and that the performance benefits of polar-graphic iconic displays stem from factors beyond the simple physical proximity of the component indicators. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Background: Prior research identified the costs of such 3D perspective hazard displays, presented from an exocentric perspective, because of their ambiguity in presenting spatial relations in an unstructured 3D space. Research also supported the advantage of display overlay, particularly when both databases (traffic and weather) need to be integrated to make hazard avoidance judgments. The two variables had not been examined in conjunction. Method: Seventeen certified flight instructors flew a series of hazard avoidance maneuvers in a part-task simulator, with four displays, created by the combination of 3D versus 2-dimensional (2D) perspective and separate versus overlay hazard formats. Positioning of traffic and weather that would make it necessary to avoid hazards was designed to allow the study of both the strengths of overlay and weaknesses of 3D integration. Results: The data clearly indicated that hazard avoidance was worse with the 3D perspective display, for both traffic and weather hazards, and pointed to ambiguity as the cause. Display overlay was better than separation, but only when the task required consulting both databases. Conclusion: 3D perspective displays are not advised for hazard presentation on the flight deck. Overlays can be helpful, as long as clutter issues are addressed. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

Using an occupational stress model we investigate a previously little studied concept of mission stressors and determine its relative impact in comparison to physical and war stressors in the prediction of four strains in deployed aircrews. Method: Questionnaires were completed by 272 deployed in-aircraft crewmembers. Three new stressors were developed for this study: mission stressors, physical stressors, and war stressors. In addition, four strains were measured: PTSD, depression, sleepiness, and nervousness. Regression analyses were used to examine the relative impact of each stressor on the four strain measures while controlling for age and occupation. Results: All three stressors played a significant role in the prediction strains with the total explained variance in the analyses ranging from 15% and 39%. Interestingly, mission stressors played the most important role in the prediction of strains possessing the largest partial eta squared in each analysis. The second most important stressor was physical stressors followed by war stressors. Conclusion: The importance of mission stressors may be because current training is designed to inoculate crewmembers to stressors such as the physical/environmental conditions and violent war actions, but there is no training or acknowledgment of the importance of dealing with mission stressors. Our findings suggest it might be beneficial for commanders to address these stressors, as it may improve short-term psychological well-being, which may ultimately impact mission success and safety.</abstract>"", '<title>Bruxism in military pilots and non-pilots: Tooth wear and psychological stress</title> <abstract>Background: Bruxism is the diurnal or nocturnal para-functional habit of clenching or grinding the teeth and affects 5-10% of the general western population. Bruxism can cause pain and irreversible damage to the teeth, periodontium, masticatory muscles, and temporo-mandibular joint. Variables such as general stress, work-related stress, and personality traits have been increasingly considered as initiating, predisposing, and perpetuating factors for bruxism. We sought to evaluate the potential of work-related stress and personality factors to induce bruxism among military pilots and non-pilot officers. Methods: Subjects were 57 healthy male Israel Air Force officers (mean age 25.8 ± 4.3 yr). Of these, 17 were jet-pilots, 18 helicopter-pilots, and 22 non-pilot officers. Tooth-wear was classified according to a six-point scale. In addition, the subjects responded to a battery of psychological questionnaires for self-assessment of stress at the workplace and their coping behavior. Results: Bruxism of clinical importance (i.e., with dentin exposure) was found in 69% of the aircrew members but only 27% of the non-pilot group. No difference was found between groups regarding stress levels. Discussion: Military aircrews may be relatively vulnerable to deleterious bruxism as well as other signs of chronic stress. Among bruxers, pilots tended to show coping strategies that were significantly more emotional and less task-oriented than non-pilots, whereas non-bruxers showed no significant differences in coping behavior. This study suggest that integrating dental and psychological preventive intervention may be helpful. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>']"

Participants were given multiple trials of practice on an air traffic control task. Measures of task-specific self-efficacy and performance were taken at repeated intervals. The authors used multilevel analysis to demonstrate differential and dynamic effects. As predicted, task-specific self-efficacy was negatively associated with task performance at the within-person level. On the other hand, average levels of task-specific self-efficacy were positively related to performance at the between-persons level and mediated the effect of general self-efficacy. The key findings from this research relate to dynamic effects - these results show that self-efficacy effects can change over time, but it depends on the level of analysis and specificity at which self-efficacy is conceptualized.

However, the findings from this research have been inconsistent. Studies have varied with respect to the identification of causal variables and the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms underlying performance. Drawing on the ecological rationality approach, we present a theory of the judgment and decision-making processes involved in a relative judgment task that explains how people judge a stimulus and adapt their decision process to accommodate their own uncertainty associated with those judgments. Undergraduate participants performed a simulated air traffic control conflict detection task. Across two experiments, we systematically manipulated variables known to affect performance. In the first experiment, we manipulated the relative distances of aircraft to a common destination while holding aircraft speeds constant. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced a direct manipulation of relative speed. We then fit a sequential sampling model to the data, and used the best fitting parameters to infer the decision-making processes responsible for performance. Findings were consistent with the theory that people adapt to their own uncertainty by adjusting their criterion and the amount of time they take to collect evidence in order to make a more accurate decision. From a practical perspective, the paper demonstrates that one can use a sequential sampling model to understand performance in a dynamic environment, allowing one to make sense of and interpret complex patterns of empirical findings that would otherwise be difficult to interpret using standard statistical analyses © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>', '<title>Assessing the Speed–Accuracy Tradeoff in Psychological Testing Using Experimental Manipulations</title> <abstract>The speed–accuracy tradeoff (SAT), where increased response speed often leads to decreased accuracy, is well established in experimental psychology. However, its implications for psychological assessments, especially in high-stakes settings, remain less understood. This study presents an experimental approach to investigate the SAT within a high-stakes spatial ability assessment. By manipulating instructions in a within-subjects design to induce speed variations in a large sample (N = 1,305) of applicants for an air traffic controller training program, we demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating working speed. Our findings confirm the presence of the SAT for most participants, suggesting that traditional ability scores may not fully reflect performance in high-stakes assessments. Importantly, we observed individual differences in the SAT, challenging the assumption of uniform SAT functions across test takers. These results highlight the complexity of interpreting high-stakes assessment outcomes and the influence of test conditions on performance dynamics. This study offers a valuable addition to the methodological toolkit for assessing the intraindividual relationship between speed and accuracy in psychological testing (including SAT research), providing a controlled approach while acknowledging the need to address potential confounders.

However, it does not account for the time taken to make a decision, nor why response bias might change over time. Sequential sampling models provide a way of accounting for speed-accuracy trade-offs and response bias shifts. In this study, we test the validity of a sequential sampling model of conflict detection in a simulated air traffic control task by assessing whether two of its key parameters respond to experimental manipulations in a theoretically consistent way. Through experimental instructions, we manipulated participants' response bias and the relative speed or accuracy of their responses. The sequential sampling model was able to replicate the trends in the conflict responses as well as response time across all conditions. Consistent with our predictions, manipulating response bias was associated primarily with changes in the model's Criterion parameter, whereas manipulating speed- accuracy instructions was associated with changes in the Threshold parameter. The success of the model in replicating the human data suggests we can use the parameters of the model to gain an insight into the underlying response bias and speed-accuracy preferences common to dynamic decision-making tasks. © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"", '<title>Cognitive and Noncognitive Determinants and Consequences of Complex Skill Acquisition</title> <abstract>Integration of multiple perspectives on the determinants of individual differences in skill acquisition is provided by examination of a wide array of predictors: ability (spatial, verbal, mathematical, and perceptual speed), personality (neuroticism, extroversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness), vocational interests (realistic and investigative), self-estimates of ability, self-concept, motivational skills, and task-specific self-efficacy.

Three moderator variables were investigated: experiment design, task type, and subjects' experience. Due to the large heterogeneity of the included experiments, we used a random-effects model. Correction for measurement error was applied. The results revealed an overall transfer effect in favor of motion (d = 0.51). Effects were weaker in true transfer (d = 0.10) than in quasi-transfer with different (d = 0.73) and identical (d = 1.19) motion, stronger for helicopter (d = 0.86) and disturbance tasks (d = 0.84) than for maneuvering fixed-wing aircraft (d = 0.07), and stronger for subjects without flight experience (d = 1.57) than for pilots with intermediate (d = 0.53) and expert (d = -0.01) experience. In conclusion, motion seems important for flight-naive individuals learning tasks with external disturbances or control of vehicles with low dynamic stability, but not for experts learning fixed-wing aircraft maneuvering tasks.

We based the analysis on the techniques developed by Hunter and Schmidt (1990). We used a d statistic for effect size calculations based on information available in the included sources. We reviewed and considered 11 studies for analysis, but only 7 of these included the information necessary for calculating effect size and we included these in the study. The result of the MA suggest a small, positive effect for motion, d=.16. No credibility interval could be built around this estimate of population mean effect size because the resulting sampling error variance was larger than the observed variance in d across the assessed studies. This led to a negative variance estimate for 5 and subsequently an estimated SD <inf>δ&</inf> of 0. These results suggest that simulator motion has a small, positive effect on pilot training transfer and contradict an earlier MA on the same subject. The small sample size (few studies) and methodological shortcomings within the included studies require that the findings be interpreted cautiously.

An interest in the acquisition of piloting skills has led a number of researchers to question the relative transfer of simulated instrument training to instrument and contact flight. In this study, we examined the transfer of simulated instrument training from Device 2F101, the operational flight trainer for the T-2C aircraft, to actual instrument and contact flight for level speed change and standard-rate turn maneuvers. Trainees were randomly assigned to one of three training levels (two, four, or eight simulator flights) and to one of two aircraft flight conditions following training (contact or basic instruments) in a counterbalanced sequence. Altitude, air speed, and heading errors in deviations from controlled flight were recorded as measures of training effectiveness. The most notable finding indicates significant and equal transfer of instrument training to contact and instrument flight for the maneuvers selected. Other findings indicate differential learning rates for the two maneuvers but also indicate equal final performance on each maneuver for both types of flight. Finally, training mix (for aircraft or simulator training trial) was found to have no effect on student performance after eight trials. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Background: Despite several decades of research, there is still debate regarding whether physical motion during flight simulation training improves later performance. Evidence suggests that presence of disturbance affects the utility of motion on transfer of training studies. Therefore, an important question is whether performance with disturbance motion (e.g., wind gusts) at test depends on whether participants practice with disturbance motion. Method: Naïve participants flew through a series of suspended rings in a motion-based simulator. Practice was with or without correlated (joystick control) and random motion (disturbance). The task was an analog of a flight task, modified to accommodate nonpilots. A quasi-transfer design included two practice blocks followed by two test blocks that incorporated both correlated and random motion. Results: No differences were detected in accuracy, but groups who practiced without disturbance made smaller joystick movements during both practice and test phases compared to those who practiced with disturbance. Conclusion: Practice without disturbance resulted in adoption of a different (possibly more efficient) joystick control strategy compared to practice with disturbance. The results suggest that during training, some control elements should be learned under relatively easy conditions, subsequently increasing in difficulty (e.g., add disturbance) at an optimal point in training. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Application of a multifactor approach to transfer of training research</title> <abstract>A multifactor, multicriterion transfer of training experiment involving a computer-generated horizontal tracking task was conducted to establish relationships among training and transfer scores for manual control of a maneuvering vehicle, to determine the response surfaces for training and transfer, and to demonstrate a new transfer research paradigm that makes economically feasible the simultaneous investigation of the effects of a large number of training-equipment and use variables on transfer to multiple-criterion vehicle configurations.

These states cannot be changed independent of each other through the aircraft control devices, the elevator and the throttle. Rather, to effectively change an aircraft's speed and altitude, the controls have to be coordinated. The mediating mechanism that underlies the coordination of the controls is the management of the aircraft's energy state. This article shows that the abstraction hierarchy (AH; Rasmussen, 1986) framework can be effectively used to gain more insight into the underlying structure of the aircraft energy management problem. The derived AH representation is based on the analysis of the energy constraints on the control task. It reveals the levels of abstraction necessary to link the aircraft's physical controls to the speed and altitude goals and also how the aircraft energy is a critical mediating state of the control problem. Energy awareness can be increased by presenting explicit energy management information. The powerful and novel concepts of the total energy reference profile and energy angle are introduced in this article and applied in the context of a perspective flight-path display.

Background: Data overload, especially in the visual channel, and associated breakdowns in monitoring represent a major challenge in aviation. These problems are expected to worsen with NextGen, which will require pilots to manage increased amounts of data and adopt new responsibilities. The introduction of multimodal interfaces (interfaces that distribute information across multiple sensory channels) has been proposed as a means to offload the overburdened visual channel and thus address data overload. Method: Experienced commercial airline pilots completed 2 scenarios using a medium-fidelity flight simulator. For each scenario, NextGen tasks and events were presented either using technology that is currently available (visual and auditory displays) or technology proposed as part of NextGen design concepts (i.e., tactile and redundant displays). Performance was measured based on response time and accuracy. Results: Faster responses were observed for redundant displays, compared to either vision or audition alone. No significant benefit of redundancy was found for accuracy and workload did not mediate redundancy effects. For traffic events, there were faster response times with tactile displays, but higher response accuracy with auditory displays. Conclusion: The findings from this research add to the knowledge base in multimodal information processing and can inform the design of displays for NextGen operations. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>A theoretical analysis and preliminary investigation of dynamically adaptive interfaces</title> <abstract>A dynamically adaptive interface (DAI) is a computer interface that changes the display or control characteristics of a system (or both) in real time. The goal of DAIs is to anticipate informational needs or desires of the user and provide that information without the requirement of an explicit control input by the user. DAIs have the potential to improve overall human-machine system performance if properly designed; they also have a very real potential to degrade performance if they are not properly designed. This article explores both theoretical and practical issues in the design of DAIs. The relation of the DAI concept to decision aiding and automation is discussed, and a theoretical framework for design is outlined. A preliminary investigation of the DAI design concept was conducted in the domain of aviation (precision, low-level navigation). Nontraditional controls (a force reflecting stick) and displays (a configurai flight director) were developed to support performance at the task. A standard interface (conventional controls and displays), a candidate interface (alternative controls and displays), and an adaptive interface (dynamically alternating between the standard and candidate displays) were evaluated. The results indicate that significant performance advantages in the quality of route navigation were obtained with the candidate and adaptive interfaces relative to the standard interface; no significant differences between the candidate and adaptive interfaces were obtained. The implications of these results are discussed, with special emphasis on their relation to fundamental challenges that must be met for the DAI concept to be a viable design alternative.</abstract>', '<title>Improved Usability of Aviation Automation Through Direct Manipulation and Graphical User Interface Design</title> <abstract>Problems in advanced commercial aircraft pilot-flight management system (FMS) interaction through multifunction control display units (MCDUs) have been widely reported.

This article takes a systematic approach toward the usability analysis of MCDU design; specifically it considers the application of foundational usability principles to aviation automation. The properties and advantages of DM and GUI design are reviewed from the perspective of MCDU design. In addition, discussion is provided on a usability inspection conducted on the MCDU interface design by human factors professionals. After this, general human-computer interaction design guidelines and recommendations on aspects of DM and GUIs relevant to the interface of the MCDU are formulated on the basis of previous empirical or analytical studies.

CHMI2 represents a new approach to aviation human factors engineering that introduces adaptive functionalities in the design of operators’ command, control and display functions. A CHMI2 system assesses human cognitive states based on measurement of key psycho-physiological observables. The cognitive states are used to predict and enhance operator performance in the accomplishment of aviation tasks, with the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall human-machine teaming. The CHMI2 system presented in this paper employs a four-layer architecture comprising sensing, extraction, classification and adaptation functionalities. An overview of each layer is provided along with the layer’s metrics, algorithms and functions. Two relevant case studies are presented to illustrate the interactions between the different layers, and the conceptual design of the associated display formats is described. The results indicate that specific eye tracking variables provide discrimination between different modes of control. Furthermore, results indicate that the higher levels of automation supported by the CHMI2 are beneficial in Separation Assurance and Collision Avoidance (SA&CA) scenarios involving low-detectability obstacles and stringent time constraints to implement recovery manoeuvres. These preliminary results highlight that the introduction of CHMI2 functionalities in future UAS can significantly reduce reaction time and enhance operational effectiveness of unmanned aircraft response to collision and loss of separation events, as well as improve the overall safety and efficiency of operations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</abstract>']"

Before the main analyses, the extreme skewness of the DLT and PMT error measures was corrected by log transformations, and between-squadrons differences in flight grades were removed by transformations based on z scores. Primary flight grades were highly correlated with the psychomotor scores (rs = -.26 to -.41) and moderately correlated with the dichotic listening scores (rs = -.22 to -.28).

When the signal rate is low this criterion is set high, causing the hit and false alarm rates to be low. With increasing time on task the criterion presumably tends to increase even further, thereby further decreasing the hit and false alarm rates. Virtually all of the empirical evidence for this simple interpretation is based on estimates of the bias measure β from signal detection theory. In this article, I describe a new approach to studying decision making that does not require the technical assumptions of signal detection theory. The results of this new analysis suggest that the detection criterion is never biased toward either response, even when the signal rate is low and the time on task is long. Two modifications of the signal detection theory framework are considered to account for this seemingly paradoxical result. The first assumes that the signal rate affects the relative sizes of the variances of the information distributions; the second assumes that the signal rate affects the logic of the operator's stopping rule. Actual or potential applications of this research include the improved training and performance assessment of operators in areas such as product quality control, air traffic control, and medical and clinical diagnosis.</abstract>"", ""<title>Do individuals' visual recognition thresholds predict performance on concurrent attitude control flight tasks?</title> <abstract>Two experiments tested near-threshold recognition performance throughout the visual field, examined the effect of the recognition task on a concurrent attitude tracking task, and tested whether individuals' near-threshold performance would predict their dual-task performance. In Experiment 1, an adaptive procedure measured the minimum viewing duration necessary for 75% performance in an aircraft classification task at various nonfoveal locations. Participants' critical tracking ability was also assessed using a central attitude display. Recognition deteriorated with eccentricity, and a wide distribution of recognition and tracking abilities was found. Experiment 2 combined the tasks; recognition was designated the primary task. Dual-task measures included the change in recognition accuracy and the increase in tracking error. Individuals' recognition thresholds (Experiment 1) failed to predict their dual-task tracking performance (Experiment 2). Notably, viewers' critical tracking ability predicted their success in preserving dual-task aircraft recognition.

Background: Researchers suggested that self-control is a limited cognitive resource used to complete a myriad of processes, including sustained attention. Past research showed that trait self-control affects some sustained attention tasks. However, little research has investigated the effect of self-control as a limited cognitive resource that varies over time (i.e., as a state-dependent variable). Methods: This experiment investigated the effect of self-control (trait and state) on a sustained motor-inhibition task (e.g., sustained attention to response task; SART). State self-control was manipulated using a between-subjects design—participants in the experimental condition completed a task designed to deplete state self-control prior to performing the SART while the control condition completed a modified version that did not deplete self-control. Results: Trait self-control predicted performance on the SART, but the depletion task (state self-control) had no detectable effect. Conclusion: Given the evidence, it is unlikely that state self-control plays a causal role in performance decrements in the SART, but there appears to be some association between performance on the SART and trait self-control.

The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions. While PPP was poorer in the SART than in the TVF, that result could be accounted for by a loss of motor control rather than a lack of mindfulness. Identical high levels of workload were generated by the TVF and SART tasks, and observers in both conditions showed similar dynamic scanning of the visual scene.Conclusion: The data indicate that the SART is not an engine of mindlessness.Application: The results challenge the widespread use of the SART to support a model in which mindlessness is considered to be the principal root of detection failures in vigilance.</abstract>']"

Background: Nontechnical skills of pilots are crucial for the conduct of safe flight operations. To train and assess these skills, reliable expert ratings are required. Literature shows to some degree that interrater reliability is influenced by factors related to the targets, scenarios, rating tools, or the raters themselves. Method: Thirty-seven type-rating examiners from a European airline assessed the performance of 4 flight crews based on video recordings using LOSA and adapted NOTECHS tools. We calculated r<inf>wg</inf> and ICC(3) to measure within-group agreement and interrater reliability. Results: The findings indicated that within-group agreement and interrater reliability were not always acceptable. It was shown that the performance of outstanding pilots was rated with the highest within-group agreement. For cognitive aspects of performance, interrater reliability was higher than for social aspects of performance. Agreement was lower on the pass–fail level than for the distinguished performance scales. Conclusion: These results suggest pass–fail decisions should not be based exclusively on nontechnical skill ratings. We furthermore recommend that regulatory authorities more systematically address interrater reliability in airline instructor training.

Background: Early work on pilot performance assessment focused on measurement models, including the accuracy and reliability of the scores attributed to the human factors variables included. More recent studies investigated the nature of the evidence that flight examiners used. No previous studies were found on how flight examiners assess line pilots’ performance during flight training and examination. Method: This study employed methods typical for cognitive anthropology, combining ethnographic observations of debriefings and interviews, stimulated recall concerning debriefing, and modified think-aloud protocols of assessment of flight episodes. Twenty-three flight examiners from 5 regional airlines were observed and interviewed in 3 contexts. Results: The data revealed that flight examiners used the documentary method, where initial observations are treated as documentary evidence of underlying phenomena (e.g., situational awareness, decision making) while presupposing these phenomena for making and categorizing the observations. Flight examiners, using a variety of techniques, actively create situations for obtaining additional observations that further substantiate the presupposed underlying phenomena. Conclusion: Even when flight examiners use rating scales, their assessment method is based on categorization of facts and, therefore, shares similarities with medical diagnosis. Suggested quality improvement measures include increasing awareness of diagnostic error, developing diagnostic tools, and developing means to measure diagnostic errors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The Effects of Tablet-Based Electronic Grading on Airline Evaluator Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: This experimental study assessed the effects of an Apple iPad (Apple and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries) grading instrument on airline evaluator performance. Background: Extant research exploring the effects of grading formats on evaluator performance focused on pen and paper modalities. This research investigated how a contemporary iPad-based grading format affected airline evaluator performance. Method: Forty-five evaluators from a major U.S. airline graded a Boeing 767 (Boeing is a wordmark of The Boeing Company, registered in the U.S. and other countries) flight crew experiencing an engine failure during takeoff. Three grading formats were used: pen and paper, a paper-based equivalent of the iPad grading format designed to replicate the function of the iPad, and the iPad. The effects of the grading formats were measured using the following dependent variables: recorded technical criteria, recorded non-technical criteria, and correlation and inter-rater agreement with a referent score. Results: Members of the iPad paper-based equivalent and iPad groups recorded significantly more technical and non-technical criteria compared to participants using pen and paper (p <.001). Members of the iPad paper-based equivalent and iPad groups had significantly higher correlation (p =.01) and inter-rater agreement levels (p <.01) compared to participants using pen and paper. Conclusion: The results of the study failed to support the iPad as a superior grading format. Research outcomes suggested structured grading may be a more important factor in predicting airline evaluator performance than the type of grading format used. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The ""Digital Other"": Self-Objectification and Narration in Contemporary Fiction</title> <abstract>The ""digital Other"" is a useful description for a phenomenon we often face in contemporary literature. Many characters act as if an invisible observer is judging them, even when they are alone or in an intimate situation. They continuously undergo acts of self-objectification, which require an optical medium, like a camera shot. The ""Other"" who holds the camera has no physical presence in the story but a psychological presence in the character\'s mind. I call this internalized authority the ""digital Other,"" and it refers to today\'s omnipresent digital visual media. The power of the digital Other could be compared to the power the air has from the perspective of an aircraft pilot. Even though the air cannot be seen or touched, it moves the plane and forces its pilot to react to it. The internalized idea of an invisible observer has the same effect on literary figures. It makes them not only decide what to wear or say but also whom they are allowed to regard as desirable and how they should perform their sexuality. Hans-Georg Moeller and Paul J. D\'Ambrosio claim that nowadays having an identity feels like presenting yourself through a social media profile, and the digital Other can be described as an agent supporting this profile-based identity. The burden of permanent self-objectification also has an impact on modes of literary narration. The digital Other entails a remarkable connection of internal and external focalizations. Literary voices seem to simultaneously describe actions both from internal and external points of view. The narrative voice sounds odd because it is subjective and yet inauthentic. Through this bizarre voice, characters are staged as objects even when they are presented through first-person narration. The narrative voice presents an imaged, idealized ego, a mode of self-presentation that obeys the digital Other. © 2023 National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved.</abstract>']"

METHODS: A team of six British military women completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire-Brief Form, Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and Personal Values Questionnaire (PVQ) prior to embarking on an expedition that traversed the Antarctic continent. Questionnaires were completed weekly on the ice; repeat of the PVQ and individual semistructured debriefing interviews were carried out within 9 d post-expedition. RESULTS: Personality findings indicated a generally well-adjusted group with notable individual differences in personality and personal values. Positive affect and camaraderie among teammates was evident throughout, although pace vs. distance in the strategy of the daily trek was a continuing point of tension. Honesty in communication was viewed as key to team effectiveness. A significant post-expedition decline in the tradition value (Pre M = -0.55, SD = 0.99; Post M = -0.82, SD = 1.12) and an increase in the conformity value (Pre M = -0.26, SD = 0.46; Post M = 0.18, SD = 0.27) was found.

Since the beginning of the space program, social and behavioral scientists have predicted that space crews increasingly will begin to experience the kinds of deviant behaviors seen in other extreme environmental duty settings as mission duration, crew size, and heterogeneity increases. However, there has been a long history of neglect by the nation\'s space agency of those psychosocial human factors which will play such a vital role in future manned spaceflight. The author argues that this is counterproductive, even dangerous, and that social and behavioral studies must be conducted to generate baseline data regarding dysfunctional acts in extreme environments, including the milieu of the space mission. An obstacle to studying occurrences and frequencies of deviant acts is the absence of a standardized definition of such acts in the extreme environment. Borrowing the sanitized NASA term ""off-nominal"", which generally refers to a maladaptive action, a preliminary reliability test was conducted among five scientists who work with human interaction in extreme environments. They were asked to rate situations from several actual space and polar expeditions for numbers of off-nominal acts. They were told the object of the exercise was to derive a standardized definition and were not provided with any specific definition of off-nominality. Substantial agreement in their ratings provided reliable information to construct a working definition of off-nominality. Various interactions and behaviors which respondents deemed off-nominal could be subsumed under poor expertise, mental disorder, forms of abuse and interpersonal insensitivity, problems of authority and responsibility, task deficits, poor hygiene and fitness, poor field-base communication, and human error with equipment from violating safety procedures and poor judgment as to its usage.</abstract>', '<title>Psychological Adaptation in a Mixed Sex and Ability Team During a Ski Expedition to the South Pole</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: expeditions in remote locations are becoming increasingly commonplace. as the composition of teams change, understanding team dynamics is important to inform subsequent expeditions in challenging environments. METHODS: eight individuals (five men, three women; five military, three civilians) completed a ski expedition from the Ronne ice shelf to the south Pole over 47 d. a mixed methods observational cohort study was undertaken, involving completing pre-expedition Multidimensional Personality Questionnaires and Portrait Values Questionnaires. During the expedition individuals completed the isolated and confined environments Questionnaire and the Positive and Negative affect scale at 7-d intervals. subsequent semistructured interviews using a topic guide informed by Goffman’s “total institution” were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire and Portrait Values Questionnaire responses were similar between participants. the isolated and confined environments Questionnaire results showed significant variation with no clear trend. statistical significance was seen in social and emotional domains between sex and occupations. Positive and Negative affect scale scoring demonstrated higher positive affect (mean ± sD; 38.9 ± 1.5) to negative (13.1 ± 1.3). subgroup analysis demonstrated significance for negative affect between sexes (one result skewed the data). the interviews highlighted that individuals found the routine and lack of personal space challenging. interpersonal relationships were a source of support but also friction. DISCUSSION: Despite similar initial questionnaires and experiences during the expedition, subjects used a diverse range of coping strategies. interpersonal factors remain the most important aspect in ensuring a successful team and pre-expeditionary work should be carried out focusing on this.

METHODS: Studied pre/post and over the 2-yr period of the investigation were 10 Danish military personnel deployed to stations in Greenland on a 26-mo staggered rotation. Subjects completed the NEO PI-R, Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and Portrait Values Questionnaire, and participated in structured interviews. During deployment, questionnaires were completed biweekly and a cognitive function test once a month. RESULTS: Personality findings indicated a generally well-adjusted group, above average in positive personality traits [Conscientiousness T-score = 59.4 (11.41); Agreeableness T-score = 54.4 (9.36)] and boldness. Personal values of benevolence and self-direction were highly rated. The decision when to ""pick sides"" and intervene during disagreements between group members was viewed as an important component of conflict resolution. There were no changes in positive/negative affect or cognitive function over the annual light/dark cycle. DISCUSSION: The personal values of group members appear highly compatible for living in a small group ICE environment for an extended period. Disagreements between group members impact the functioning of the entire group, particularly in regard to decisions whether to support one of the individuals or let the argument run its course. Extended training in strategies for conflict resolution are needed in planning for future long duration missions to avoid fault lines forming within the group. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>The activities of the 42nd Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE-42) wintering team 2001-2002</title> <abstract>The 42nd Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE-42) wintering team has conducted the Vth five-year JARE program during the period of February 1st 2001 to January 31st 2002, in which 40 members were engaged in the various scientific activities and maintenance of Syowa Station.

The FFM was used to determine whether a sample of clinically referred military aviators exhibited commonly occurring personality clusters. Methods: The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was used to evaluate 956 clinically referred U.S. Naval aviators and flight officers on the domains of neuroticism (N), extroversion (E), openness (O), agreeableness (A), and conscientiousness (C). The scores were subjected to model-based cluster analysis and emergent clusters were compared with respect to their scores and clinical outcomes. Results: A two-cluster model provided the best fit to the data. MANOVA indicated significant differences between the two cluster groups with respect to four of the five factors (N, E, A, and C). The greatest differences were for N and E, with the smaller group (Group 1, N 5 291) being significantly more neurotic and less extroverted than Group 2 (N 5 665). Cluster membership had more specificity (0.74) than sensitivity (0.59) for predicting adverse clinical outcome, with the probability of an adverse clinical outcome increasing from 0.14 to 0.28 for those in the neurotic and introverted Group 1.

Presented is a naval flight officer whose personality traits were a threat to these key tenets and ultimately warranted removal from flight status. Case Report: A naval flight officer was twice referred to Human Factors Boards (HFBs) after concerns were raised about her emotional stability in and out of the cockpit. Her history revealed multiple clinical presentations revealing personality characteristics that should have raised immediate concern about her aeronautical adaptability. Formal psychiatric evaluation after her second HFB confirmed the presence of personality traits incompatible with aviation duty, but not until she had served nearly 4 yr as an aviation officer. Discussion: Aeronautical adaptability is a U.S. Naval term used to describe an individual\'s ability to work successfully in the aviation environment. Naval aviation personnel are considered not aeronautically adaptable/adapted if diagnosed with a ""personality disorder or prominent personality traits that adversely affect flight safety, mission completion, or crew coordination."" The Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army endorse similar concepts. Except for the U.S. Navy definition, aeronautical adaptability does not include formal DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, and, thus, flight surgeons and aviation medical examiners often make difficult aeromedical dispositions based on vague and subjective criteria. Conclusions: Determining aeronautical adaptability is not a simple, solitary process. It requires heightened suspicion, continual surveillance of suspect aviators, and collaboration from aviation medical professionals to ensure aviation safety.

Groups of pesonality traits, both enhancing and protecting against risk of heart disease, were identified in these subjects. Personality trait patterns tending to be least associated with cardiovascular risk are tentatively identified by the three MMPI scales: psychasthenia, schizophrenia, and social introversion. On the other hand, the scales most strongly related to CHD risk in the submariner sample were denial of symptoms as measured by the K-scale, hypochondriasis, and hysteria. While the inherent inaccuracy in the prediction of CHD risk in young healthy individuals limits generalization from these findings, the potential utility of the MMPI to assist in risk detection is indicated. Comparisons of cigarette smoking, coffee drinking, and alcohol consumption with personality characteristics identified by the MMPI yielded trait clusters associated with each addictive habit. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption tended to correlate with traits positively associated with CHD risk. The correlations between those addictive habits and MMPI subtest scores were most significant for the F-scale, which measures inordinate tendencies to exaggerated emotional symptoms, and for the psychopathic deviate and hypomania scales. Significant negative correlations were found between the amount of coffee consumed and those personality traits negatively associated with CHD risk. These negative relationships were most significant for the MMPI scales schizophrenia and psychasthenia. Though the relationships were not necessarily construed to be causal, the contrasting modes through which these drug-associated habits appeared to relate to cardiovascular risk lend some support to the assumption that individuals with various specific sets of personality characteristics tend to incorporate these addictive behaviors into their behavior repertoire in very different ways.</abstract>', '<title>Compilation of cognitive and personality norms for military aviators</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The assessment of individuals on abilities or other characteristics is based on comparison to a representative sample. General population norms provide an appropriate reference group when the distribution of scores in the sample can be expected to be similar to those for the general population (e.g., comparing high school students at a particular school to national high school norms on a college entrance test). Specialized norms are needed, however, when subsets of the population differ from the population at large. Military pilot trainees represent a special population; they are highly screened on cognitive ability and other characteristics thought to be related to job performance. Other characteristics (e.g., personality) are thought to be ""self-selected,"" resulting in distinctive profiles. Normative tables were developed for U.S. Air Force pilot trainees for two widely used tests, the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery-II (MAB-II) and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). METHODS: The MAB-II and NEO PI-R were administered to large samples of USAF cadets, ROTC students, and officers selected for pilot training. RESULTS: The mean MAB-II full-scale IQ was about 1.5 SD above the adult population norm and was much less variable, supporting the need for specialized norms. Tables showing the percentile equivalents are provided for use by clinicians. DISCUSSION: Use of these tables, in addition to, or in lieu of, commercially published norms, will prove helpful when clinical psychologists perform assessments on pilots; in particular when evaluating them for return-to-duty status following a disqualifying condition that may have affected cognitive functioning or emotional stability. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

Both groups were exposed to cross-coupled accelerations on a Barany chair at 15 rpm along with 0.5 Hz head flexions. The pathological group showed a straightened cervical curvature as well as a significantly higher degree of malaise (scale of Graybiel and Lackner). Their personalities were highly alexithymic or obsessive compared to the control group (Kruskal-Wallis Test). Alexithymic and obsessive personalities may express their stress reactions and psychic conflicts through somatic signs, such as cervical muscle contractures; consequently, straightening the cervical spine with the subsequent alteration of proprioceptive inputs to the vestibular nuclei may increase motion sickness susceptibility.</abstract>"", '<title>Sex differences in tolerance to visually-induced motion sickness</title> <abstract>Background: Women report a history of motion sickness (MS) about twice as frequently as men, but the results of experimental studies are equivocal.

We examined the hypothesis that those reporting that they are prone to MS are less likely to volunteer for MS provocative experiments than those who are MS resistant. Finally, using a subset of these participants, we exposed men and women, during two separate sessions, to visually elicited apparent motion, with and without voluntary head motion (pseudo-Coriolis stimulation), to examine any differences in MS elicited between these two groups on exposure to such motion stimulation. Method: Experiment 1 used a MS History Questionnaire, which included an opportunity for male and female participants to volunteer for ""psychology experiments"" in the coming semester. This instrument was used to determine effects of sex and volunteer status on motion sickness susceptibility (MSS). Experiment 2 involved exposing a subset of these participants to rotation of a vertically striped rotating drum under static and head movement conditions. Measures of vection and MS were recorded. Results: We found higher MSS scores in women vs. men, particularly when looking at participants who elected to volunteer. Women in the second experiment reported significantly more MS, but they exhibited less tolerance with head movement. No significant differences in vection were observed.

Susceptibility to motion sickness was determined by scores on a motion sickness questionnaire (MSQ); only individuals with extreme scores were considered for inclusion in the experimental groups. The following tests were administered: Floor Ataxia Test Battery, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, Cornell Medical Index, Cornell Word Form, Eysenck Personality Inventory, Rotter Internal External Locus of Control Scale, and the 16 Personality Factors test. Each subject was tested on at least three, but not more than six, of the eight tests. Significant sex differences were obtained on the ataxia battery and the Cornell Medical Index. Susceptible subjects did not differ significantly from nonsusceptibles on the ataxia battery but did differ significantly on all personality tests except the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (administered only to women) and the Rotter Scale. The generally consistent and significant patterns of results from the psychological tests probably reflect the selection factors used in defining the subject groups; certain personality characteristics are associated with a high degree of susceptibility to motion sickness.</abstract>']"

The transfer of training experiment and the rating method are the two present-day ways of evaluating the worth of a simulator. The transfer experiment requires the trainee to practice in the simulator and then be tested in the parent aircraft to demonstrate the training value of the simulator. The rating method requires the pilot to be experienced in the parent aircraft and to rate the simulator for similarity to the aircraft. If similarity is high, the training value is assumed to be high. Arguments are presented that both of these methods are flawed. It is contended that a simulator, or any other system, need not necessarily be tested if it is based on reliable scientific laws and the success of other systems, based on the same laws, has been high. Good laws produce accurate prediction, and when outcome can be predicted it is redundant to conduct a system evaluation. With uncertainty about laws, the requirement for system testing increases.

The consequence of this widely held position has been the specification of training device requirements solely on the basis of engineering criteria. However, the proper criterion is the flight hours saved in airborne training for each incremental investment in ground training. Furthermore, research has shown that innovations in training strategies, in some cases involving intentional departures from reality, can have stronger effects than high simulator fidelity on the resulting quality of pilot performance. Ideally, each aspect of the training curriculum could be taught to some criterion performance level on the ground. Competence in each block of training would be demonstrated after a brief transition in the airplane. Certification for each license and rating would be based on demonstrated competence, thereby making possible large reductions in the minimum required flying hours. Credit for ground-based training would no longer be a formal issue. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

It is, therefore, surprising that there are few general methods that guide the design of simulation-based training. The lack of such methods is problematic. Due to recent factors in the aviation industry, such as advances in technology, individuals must now possess a range of skills, increasingly cognitive in nature, that must be trained and evaluated through hands-on experience. Second, training is broadening from an almost exclusive focus on individuals and teams to include multiple crews. It is clear that exercise design methodologies are needed. The purpose of this article is to describe a general approach to the design of simulation-based exercises referred to as the Event-Based Approach to Training (EBAT). Event-based techniques guide the design of training opportunities by systematically identifying and introducing events within training exercises that provide known opportunities to observe behaviors of interest. With EBAT, explicit links are maintained between training objectives, exercise design, and performance assessment. We also discuss several recent applications and address potential new areas that may benefit from its application.</abstract>', '<title>The Future of Fighter Pilot Training? Live Virtual Constructive in Large Force Exercises: Perceived and Expected Training Value</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates whether and how perceived training value varies among fighter pilots participating in a large force exercise (LFE), and whether they expect Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) training to enhance training value of future LFEs. Background: LVC technology is maturing but its expected training value is under-investigated, especially regarding future LVC in LFEs. Method: Fighter pilots at a Live-flying LFE answered questionnaires, 120 responses were analyzed statistically. The questions focused on whether the sortie they just flew provided training value, generally and for specific Desired Learning Objectives (DLOs), on whether the inclusion of Virtual and Constructive entities in future LFEs would contribute to training value generally and to the DLOs specifically, and on specific LVC implementation issues. Results: Ratings of experienced training value varied across DLOs, and DLO ratings varied across Mission types. Fighter pilots were positive toward including Virtual and Constructive entities in LFEs for certain DLOs, mostly for flying a complex mission. DLOs covaried around the factors of LVC-tradeoff advantages and Live advantages, as well as temporal dimensions of planning before a mission and stages of engagement. LVC implementation lessons were extracted. Conclusion: Fighter pilots are generally moderately positive about LVC in LFEs. The measurement of perceived training value per DLO seems a relevant instrument for investigating perceived training value of an LFE and expected training value of future LVC training. © 2023 Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI.

Background: As flight simulation technology has become more advanced, and the associated costs have been reduced, there has been a corresponding increase in the use of flight simulation during ab initio phases of pilot training. Subsequently, important questions have arisen regarding the utility of simulation-based training to develop students’ rudimentary piloting skills. Method: The progression of 29 students completing a course consisting of 25% simulation is compared to a baseline sample of 62 students (sourced from historical data) completing the same course prior to the integration of additional simulation-based training. Results: The integration of simulation was found to have 2 primary impacts. Although a small decrease in aircraft training hours was evident, there was also a significant increase in the overall training time once simulation-based training was incorporated. Conclusion: Simulation will always provide significant safety and risk-reduction benefits to flight training; however, when considering the practical implications of integrating simulation-based training, the current data provide a cautionary tale that positive outcomes for training efficiency and cost-effectiveness are not always guaranteed. More targeted inquiry is still needed to assist flight schools to properly operationalize the findings from the research literature to effectively integrate simulation into their flight-training curriculums. © 2016 Crown Copyright.</abstract>']"

Assessments made included rectal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, palmar evaporative water loss, urinalysis, reaction time, decision time, critical flicker fusion, subjective fatigue and well-being, and intellectual facility. The intercontinental flights consisted of east-west and west-east flights which permitted a comparative analysis of bidirectional effects of time zone displacements and a north-south flight which provided an appraisal of effects solely attributable to prolonged flight. Shifts of the phase of circadian periodicity manifested by the physiological functions were effected by the east-west and west-east flights but not by the north-south flight. Bidirectional differences in lag time and extent of dissociation were revealed, but these may be due to individual variability. All flights engendered significant increment in subjective fatigue. Only one flight, the east-west, produced significant performance deficit indicating that while rapid translocation through many time zones does effect physiological phase shifts requiring 4-6 days for completion and impairment of well-being, these phenomena are not accompanied by a commensurate change in the efficiency of basic psychological functions.</abstract>', '<title>The impact of an implementation intention to improve mealtimes and reduce jet lag in long-haul cabin crew</title> <abstract>Objective: Jet lag is common place amongst long-haul cabin crew. Timed food has been shown to reset the circadian rhythm in rodents. Implementation intentions have been used to change eating behaviour. Mealtimes could therefore be used as a countermeasure to reduce jet lag and improve alertness in long-haul cabin crew through forming an implementation intention to improve the regularity of meals on days off. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a randomised controlled trial, with two conditions: forming an implementation intention to eat regular meals on days off vs. no implementation intention. Pre-intervention measurements were taken at baseline (before a long-haul trip) and post-intervention measures were taken on the first and second days off post-trip. Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) and objective alertness (Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)). Results: Mixed ANOVA showed a significant condition x time interaction for unidimensional jet lag but not for multidimensional jet lag and objective alertness. In particular, the formation of an implementation intention to alter mealtimes resulted in a reduction of unidimensional jet lag. Conclusion: Implementation intentions can be used to alleviate jet lag in long-haul crew through promoting a change in mealtimes. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>', ""<title>To what extent is circadian phase predictive of subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew pre- and post-trip?</title> <abstract>Long-haul cabin crew regularly report misalignment between their circadian phase and the external world (i.e. jet lag). The extent to which changes in circadian phase relate to reported levels of jet lag remains unclear. The main aim of the present study was first to evaluate the relationship between objective (circadian phase) and subjective jet lag and second to explore the relative role of both subjective and objective psycho-behavioural factors in predicting the subjective experience of jet lag. Twenty-eight long-haul cabin crew completed questionnaires measuring diurnal preference, trip characteristics and subjective jet lag as a single and as a multidimensional measure. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and urinary melatonin peak time was measured, at baseline (T1), e.g. before a long-haul trip and post-trip on the crew's first recovery day (T2). Subjective jet lag was also measured at both time points. At T1, later circadian phase related to increased unidimensional jet lag, however, a post-trip discrepancy was found between objective and subjective uni- and multidimensional jet lag measured at T2 and change from T1 to T2. After controlling for direction and size of circadian phase, increased uni- and multidimensional subjective jet lag was predicted by depressed mood states. The regression models including phase, diurnal preference, departure time on the outbound sector and arousal levels accounted for 28% of the variance in unidimensional jet lag and 53% of the variance in multidimensional jet lag. It was concluded that there is a discordance between objective and subjective jet lag post-trip. Further, subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew is better explained by mood impairment than circadian phase. The results are discussed with reference to the gap between subjective and objective jet lag and the role of psychology rather than just biology in the jet lag experience. The implications for improving health and safety in the workplace, through a better understanding of the role of human factors in the management of jet lag, are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"", '<title>Circadian rhythms in airline pilots submitted to long-haul transmeridian flights</title> <abstract>Background: Circadian rhythms shift out of phase after transmeridian flights. Desynchronization between body rhythms and the environment is linked to jet lag, which depends on age, flight direction, and number of time zones crossed. Methods: To investigate this problem in airline pilots, we performed a multivariate analysis of their circadian systems during Madrid-Mexico-Madrid flights (-7 time zones, n = 12) and Madrid-Tokyo-Madrid flights (+8 time zones, n = 21). Telemetry was used to record pilots\' activity, skin temperature, and heart rate, obtaining 6 d of continuous data, including 2 d before the flight, the flights themselves, 2 d atthe stopover, and 1 d after the return flight. Time series were analyzed by cosinor, and the resulting parameters of the rhythms were compared by ANOVA and Tukey contrasts in every category formed by the age groups (under and over 50 yr old) and flight direction groups. Subjective time estimation of short, intermediate, and long intervals was recorded. Other psychological variables were measured, including anxiety, tiredness, and performance. Results and Conclusions: Activity/rest and heart rate rhythms appeared to be linked to a ""weak oscillator."" Temperature rhythms manifested a rigid response after the phase shifts of the light/dark cycle, closely related to the biological clock. Subjective time appreciation tended to be overestimated without exhibiting a clear circadian component, but attributable to fatigue and stress. Psychometric evaluation showed that desynchronization affected all the pilots. Some results showed an age-related variability with a more marked influence in younger pilots. No consistent effects regarding flight direction were found.</abstract>', '<title>Predicting jet lag in long-haul cabin crew: The role of illness cognitions and behaviour</title> <abstract>Objective: Established risk factors for jet lag are mostly physiological including circadian preference, age, gender, the number of flight zones crossed and to some extent direction of travel. Some research has also highlighted a role for psychosocial factors including sleep, diet and ‘circadian’ health behaviours and illness cognitions although this remains relatively untested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sleep, diet and illness cognitions in predicting perceived jet lag amongst long-haul crew. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a longitudinal study. Profile characteristics (including chronotype), preparation strategies (sleep, eating and ‘circadian’ behaviours) and illness cognitions were measured at baseline (before a trip). Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) was measured on the crews’ second day off (post-trip). Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that unidimensional jet lag was predicted by the belief in a cyclical timeline, whereas multidimensional jet lag was predicted by multidimensional jet lag at baseline and to a lesser extent by identity. No role was found for profile characteristics and preparation strategies. Conclusion: Illness cognitions partly explain the experience of perceived jet lag in long-haul cabin crew indicating that jet lag is in part a psycho-social construct, not just a biological one. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>']"

The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in cognitive function during and after lower body water immersion. Methods: On separate mornings, nine young healthy men participated in both neutral (35 ± 1°C) and cold (13 ± 1°C) water immersion. Subjects rested in neutral air for 30 min followed by 60 min water immersion to the iliac crest and 15 min of recovery in neutral air. Rectal temperature and mean skin temperature were continuously monitored. Metabolic rate, the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) were quantified at predetermined intervals. Results: During immersion in cold water, rectal temperature was reduced, but SCWT and POMS scores were unchanged relative to baseline. Despite the reduced rectal temperature, little to no shivering was observed during immersion and metabolic rate did not change. During recovery from cold immersion, rectal temperature was further reduced by; 0.5°C, shivering was noted, and metabolic rate increased. Coincident with this acute afterdrop, SCWT Color-Word performance (Δ = 2 4 ± 8 vs. 7 ± 6 correct responses) and Interference score (Δ = 2 2 ± 7 vs. 4 ± 8) was impaired relative to recovery from neutral immersion (i.e., when core temperature and metabolic rate did not change).

Methods: Eight males exercised while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in a warm, dry environment (dry bulb temperature: 30°C; dew-point temperature: 11°C) in each of the tests. Treadmill exercise was performed (∼225 W·m-2) for 80 min. A liquid cooling garment (LCG) covered 72% of the body surface area. Core temperature (Tc), local skin temperatures, heart rate, inlet and outlet LCG perfusate temperatures, flow, and electrical power to the LCG and metabolic rate were measured during exercise. Results: At 75 min of exercise T̄sk was higher (33.9 ± 0.2°C) in PCskin, than in PC (33.1 ± 0.5°C) or CC (32.0 ± 0.6°C) and PC > CC. The changes in Tc and heart rate during the tests were not different. Tc at 75 min was not different among the cooling paradigms (37.6 ± 0.3°C in PCskin, 37.6 ± 0.2°C in PC and 37.6 ± 0.2°C in CC). Heart rate averaged 124 ± 10 bpm in PCskin, 120 ± 9 bpm in PC and 117 ± 9 bpm in CC. Total body insulation (°C·W-1·m-2) was significantly reduced in PCskin (0.020 ± 0.003) and PC (0.024 ± 0.004) from CC (0.029 ± 0.004). Electrical power in PCskin was reduced by 46% from CC and by 28% from PC.

Heat stress can influence human cognitive activity, which might be critical in the flying situation, requiring efficient and error-free performance. This study investigated the effect of wearing protective clothing under various ambient conditions on physiological and cognitive performance. On several occasions, eight subjects were exposed for 3 h to three different environmental conditions; 0°C at 80% RH, 23°C at 63% RH and 40°C at 19% RH. The subjects were equipped with thermistors, dressed as they normally do for flights (including helmet, two layers of underwear and an uninsulated survival suit). During three separate exposures the subjects carried out two cognitive performance tests (Vigilance test and DG test). Performance was scored as correct, incorrect, missed reaction and reaction time. Skin temperature, deep body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, temperature and humidity inside the clothing, sweat loss, subjective sensation of temperature and thermal comfort were measured. Rises in rectal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate and body water loss indicated a high level of heat stress in the 40°C ambient temperature condition in comparison with 0°C and 23°C. Performance of the DG test was unaffected by ambient temperature. However, the number of incorrect reactions in the Vigilance test was significantly higher at 40°C than at 23°C (p = 0.006) or 0°C (p = 0.03). The effect on Vigilance performance correlated with changes in deep-body temperature, and this is in accordance with earlier studies that have demonstrated that cognitive performance is virtually unaffected unless environmental conditions are sufficient to change deep body temperature.</abstract>', '<title>Habituation of the cold shock response may include a signifi cant perceptual component</title> <abstract>Introduction: Accidental immersion in cold water is a risk factor for many occupations. Habituation to cold-water immersion (CWI) is one practical means of reducing the cold shock response (CSR) on immersion. We investigated whether repeated thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) induced a perceptual habituation (i.e., could lessen perceived threat and anxiety) and consequently reduce the CSR on subsequent CWI. Methods: There were 12 subjects who completed seven 7-min head-out immersions. Immersions one and seven were CWIs [15.0 (0.1)°C], and immersions two to six were TWI [34.9 (0.10)°C]. Anxiety (20-cm visual analogue scale) and the cardiorespiratory responses [heart rate (f <inf>c</inf> ), respiratory frequency (f <inf>R</inf> ), tidal volume (V <inf>T</inf> ), and minute ventilation ( V <inf>E</inf> )] to immersion were measured throughout. Data were compared within subject between conditions using ANOVA to an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Acute anxiety was signifi cantly reduced after repeated exposure to the immersion scenario (i.e., TWI): CWI-1: 6.3 (4.4) cm; and CWI-2: 4.5 (4.0) cm [condition mean (SD)]. These differences did not infl uence the peak in the CSR. The f <inf>c</inf> , f <inf>R</inf> , and .V E responses were similar between CWI-1 and CWI-2. V <inf>T</inf> response was signifi cantly lower in CWI- 2; mean (SD) across the immersion: CWI-1 1.27 (0.17) vs. CWI-2 1.11 (0.2) L. Discussion: Repeated TWI lessened the anxiety associated with CWI (perceptual habituation). This had a negligible effect on the primary components of the CSR, but did lower V <inf>T</inf> , which may reduce the volume of any aspirated water in an emergency situation. Reducing the threat appraisal of an environmental stressor may be a useful biproduct of survival training, thereby minimizing psychophysiological strain. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Thermal balance effects on vigilance during 2-hour exposures to -20°C</title> <abstract>Introduction: Human mental performance is markedly affected by environmental temperature, body temperature, body heat content, and comfort, but the effects of these different factors are not entirely clear. A liquid conditioning garment (LCG) can be used to manipulate these factors independently. We hypothesized that cold exposure (coldEX) has negative effects on vigilance which can be alleviated by increasing body heat content throughout or prior to coldEX. Methods: Subjects (n = 10) were tested for vigilance during a 130-min coldEX to -20°C while warmly clothed; a period of moderate exercise occurred at minutes 64-74. An LCG was used to provide heating either before coldEX (prior heating, PH) or throughout coldEX (heating, H); the control condition involved no heating (NH). Results: There were significant differences among conditions for rectal temperature (PH: 37.3 ± 0.26°C, H: 37.0 ± 0.24°C, NH: 37.05 ± 0.26°C) and mean skin temperature (PH: 33.85 ± 1.21°C, H: 35.11 ± 1.35°C, NH: 32.84 ± 0.65°C). Reaction time decreased significantly after the 45th minute of coldEX in H and NH. At the same time, signal detection criteria in all conditions demonstrated considerable alterations, indicating bias in favor of 'target-present' responses, which were associated with lower mean skin temperature and thermal comfort vote. PH was more effective than H and NH in preserving reaction time and response consistency. Relative to men, women demonstrated increased heat loss and more deteriorated vigilance and signal detection. Conclusion: Vigilance deteriorates in cold conditions within 45 min of exposure. Increasing body heat content prior to coldEX is efficacious in preserving vigilance performance during exposures lasting up to 2 h. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>""]"

Efforts are underway at the Air Force Research Laboratory to minimize the negative effect of human performance variability on high-altitude airdrop accuracy. Precision guidance to the calculated air release point, as presented through the new display, offers potential reduction in flight performance variability.

The out-the-window scene (presented or blanked) effects were also assessed. Results: Results suggest improved performance over existing methods of airdrop guidance as measured by both aircraft position at green light and the comparison between actual and optimal flightpaths.

Three ADI display formats were examined: (a) conventional MH; (b) perspective-view aircraft symbol (PAS), which replaced the conventional miniature aircraft symbol with a pictorial moving aircraft symbol; and (c) command, which presented the appropriate direction for recovery using the pitch or roll arrow. Twenty-two participants (10 unmanned aircraft operators, 12 nonoperators) performed a series of trials in a low-fidelity ADI simulator in which they attempted to recover from a series of unusual attitudes. The results revealed that the combination effect differed according to display format. The command display expedited initiation of the roll input regardless of reference frame.

Of interest was whether the effects found in earlier studies, favoring the moving-aircraft format, could be replicated with most recent technology including extended horizon displays, which depict the artificial horizon extended over the whole screen with overlaying speed and altitude scales (e.g., B787). Background: Although the moving-horizon format represents the standard approach in Western aviation, human factors research from the 1950s to the 1970s with round electromechanical instruments favored the moving-aircraft format with respect to better support of flight-path tracking and unusual attitude recoveries. However, recent studies using laboratory displays more similar to modern primary flight displays provided inconsistent results. This led to the assumption that the display’s design is a moderating factor of those effects. Method: Thirty-two novices and 13 pilots flew several tracking and recovery tasks in a PC-based simulator equipped with moving-horizon and moving-aircraft formats in classic and extended horizon design. Results: The data show that the previous effects favoring a moving-aircraft format of displaying bank information can be replicated with current primary flight display designs. However, the extended horizon design seems to reduce this effect, at least for pilots.

The noise featured a Dopplerlike quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d‘) was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a “floor effect” rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload.

These can be classified into those caused by passenger activities such as conversations and luggage-related rearrangements as well as those caused by flight-crew such as flight attendant-related speaking activities, announcements from pilot and flight attendants, mechanical noises during food/beverage services and flight security demonstrations, and other announcement signals. In this study, in-cabin noise levels were measured during all flight activities in a commercial jet passenger plane. These noise levels consist of both continuous and discontinuous types. As a general tendency, continuous noise levels were seen to be 60-65 dB(A) prior to takeoff, and 80-85 dB(A) and 75-80 dB(A) during flight and landing, respectively. Discontinuous in-cabin noise levels were observed to reach levels as high as 81-88 dB(A) range. This study shows that it can be possible to control and reduce in-cabin noise levels, especially due to human activities and a few recommendations are suggested.</abstract>', '<title>Nocturnal aircraft noise effects</title> <abstract>Noise protection associated with the construction and extension of airports in the Federal Republic of Germany has been regulated by the law for protection against aircraft noise since 1971. This legislation is due for revision because of different aspects. One aspect is the growth of air traffic which has led many airports to the limits of their capacity and in search of new ways of adaptation to the increasing demand for flight services. Another aspect is the increasing concern of the population about noise effects which has to be addressed by better protection against the effects of aircraft noise. The framework conditions of policy in terms of society as a whole, its health and economic environment need to be put into effect by political action. Science can contribute to this goal by performing noise effects research and by providing recommendations to the political body. However, it remains controversial, what measures are necessary or adequate to assure effective protection of the population against aircraft noise. This is particularly true for the protection of rest and sleep at night. The problem of finding a common basis for adequate recommendations is associated with (1) the low number of primary studies, which also exhibited highly variable results and assessments, (2) the handling of acoustic or psycho-acoustic dimensions for quantifying psychological or physiological reactions, and (3) the conception of how far preventive measures have to go to prove effective. With this in mind, the DLR Institute for Aerospace Medicine is conducting a large-scale, multi-stage study for investigating the acute effects of nocturnal aircraft noise on human sleep. This enterprise is implemented in the framework of the HGF/DLR project ""Quiet Air Traffic"" for developing sustainable assessment criteria for human-specific effects of aircraft noise at night.</abstract>', ""<title>Seat vibration in military propeller aircraft: Characterization, exposure assessment, and mitigation</title> <abstract>Introduction: There have been increasing reports of annoyance, fatigue, and even neck and back pain during prolonged operation of military propeller aircraft, where persistent multi-axis vibration occurs at higher frequencies beyond human whole-body resonance. This paper characterizes and assesses the higher frequency vibration transmitted to the occupants onboard these aircraft. Methods: Multi-axis accelerations were measured at the occupied seating surfaces onboard the WC/C-130J, C-130H3, and E-2C Hawkeye. The effects of the vibration were assessed in accordance with current international guidelines (ISO 2631-1:1997). The relative psychophysical effects of the frequency components and the effects of selected mitigation strategies were also investigated. Results: The accelerations associated with the blade passage frequency measured on the passenger seat pans located on the side of the fuselage near the propeller plane of the C-130J (102 Hz) and C-130H3 (68 Hz) were noteworthy (5.19 ± 1.72 ms-2 rms and 7.65 ± 0.71 ms-2 rms, respectively, in the lateral direction of the aircraft). The psychophysical results indicated that the higher frequency component would dominate the side passengers' perception of the vibration. Balancing the props significantly reduced the lower frequency propeller rotation vibration (17 Hz), but had little effect on the blade passage frequency vibration. Conclusions: The relationships among the frequency, vibration direction, and seat measurement sites were complex, challenging the development of seating systems and mitigation strategies. Psychophysical metrics could provide a tool for optimizing mitigation strategies, but the current international vibration standard may not provide optimum assessment methods for evaluating higher frequency operational exposures.

Although short-term noise measurements have been done for almost all fighters, platforms and airports, there is little information on the long-term exposure of pilots and technicians. Noise was measured in the following types of Finnish fighters: Hornet F-18, Saab 35 Draken, Mig 21 Bis, jet trainer BA Hawk MK-51 and basic trainers. The pilots used Gentex helmets in the F-18, a FFV Flyghjälm helmet in the Draken, a ZSH-5A helmet in the Mig and an Alpha helmet in the Hawk, Vinka and Redigo. The noise exposures were evaluated by noise dose meters and tape-recording systems outside and inside the flight helmet. The averaged values for the pilots varied over the flight in the cockpit from 96 to 100 dB and in the ear canal from 88 to 95 dB The highest values were measured in Mig 21 Bis fighters. The analyses indicated that radio noise, as measured equivalent noise, is 4-10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. According to the audiometric data of this study a pilot with an average of 600 hours of flying time should not be at risk of hearing loss. However, noise can still influence flight safety parameters and other physiological or psychological effects. Over a day, the technicians received surprisingly similar noise exposures, varying from 93 to 97 dB. The start values were highest (108 dB L<inf>Aeq15min</inf>) for F-18 and Hawk planes, which use an auxiliary starting motor. If the earmuffs in use were able to reduce the fighter noise by 30 dB, the daily exposure of technicians would vary from 63 to 67 dB, and, if the A-weighted instantaneous sound pressure levels vary from 110 to 120dB on the platform, then the maximum noise levels entering the ear canal would be 80-90dB.</abstract>']"

The task, CAMS (Cabin Air Management System), represents a computer-based simulation of a generic life support system. As a multiple-task environment, it allows the measurement of a wide range of task management variables such as primary and secondary task performance, and system control activities. Measures of subjective state variables were also taken. The results did not show any evidence of serious performance decrements for any crew member. The analysis revealed different adjustment patterns with which crew members responded as a function of mission duration and variations in workload. Among the secondary tasks employed, prospective memory was found to be more sensitive than reaction time to increases in workload.

Recovery has been suggested to take place after perceptual modification or reinterpretation. To elucidate this process, 10 subjects who repeatedly experienced a visual/vestibular conflict (Purkinje) over trials and days, were then tested in a similar but not identical perceptual situation (pseudo-Coriolis) to determine whether any savings in perceptual adaptation had occurred as compared to an unpracticed control group (N = 10). The practiced subjects experienced lessening dizziness and ataxia within and over sessions. Their response to the new perceptual situation was markedly less than the control group (p less than 0.001). Assessment of ""adaptability,"" in addition to the provocative vestibular tests now in use, may improve prediction of susceptibility to the space adaptation syndrome. An adaptability trait may exist in humans which, properly measured, could be used to predict who would adapt more readily to visual/vestibular conflict and perhaps to environmental stressors in general.</abstract>', '<title>Human performance time model of spacecraft control panel operation in simulated microgravity</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Human performance modeling plays an important role in the design and management of human spaceflight missions. Previous studies reported that manual control task time increased in microgravity conditions. The current study aimed to find a modeling method that can quantify and predict the task time of spacecraft control panel operation in the simulated microgravity condition. METHODS: We proposed the application of a predetermined elemental task method together with an information processing time model to quantify both physical motion time and cognitive time. The time increment due to microgravity was hypothesized to be proportional to physical motion time. The total task time in the microgravity condition could be calculated as the model time from the normal ground condition plus the predicted time increment. Human data were collected from an experiment asking participants to perform six emergency operating procedure tasks in both normal ground and simulated microgravity conditions. RESULTS: The proposed method resulted in good fitness to human data in both conditions, as shown by both regression fitness (R2 values = 0.99) and modeling error measures (root mean square error ≤ 3.3 s; mean absolute percentage error ≤ 16.1%).

In addition to the conservative physiological homeostasies, the quantitative description of the astronaut's motor activity in microgravity is postulated in terms of an innovative regulation, within a temporal dynamic. The proposed ethological method consists of first drawing up a specific behavioural repertoire and then of using video recordings of space missions to describe each of the behavioural units observed in the ongoing flux context in which it occurred. Finally the data is quantified into frequencies of occurrence, transition and association and completed with factorial correlation analysis. Comparison of ground training (g = 1) and space flight (g = 0) between the first and last day of a mission up to return to Earth gravity simulated by an anti-orthostatic decubitus experiment, reveals the nature of the adaptive strategies implemented. These strategies are evidence of changes in the behavioural repertoire including the search for predominantly visual environmental cues and the progression of motor skill during the flight. The pre-flight period is defined as a phase involving automizing of motor patterns and the post-flight period as rehabituation of strategies which have already been acquired. The phenomena observed are discussed in terms of the new spatial representation and the body image, constructed by the astronaut during his adaptation. They are considered to be optimizing for the subject's relation to his environment. © 1994.</abstract>"", '<title>Self-motion perception: Assessment by computer-generated animations</title> <abstract>The goal of this research is more precise description of adaptation to sensory rearrangements, including microgravity, by development of improved procedures for assessing spatial orientation perception. Thirty-six subjects reported perceived self-motion following exposure to complex inertial-visual motion. Twelve subjects were assigned to each of 3 perceptual reporting procedures: (a) animation movie selection, (b) written report selection and (c) verbal report generation. The question addressed was: do reports produced by these procedures differ with respect to complexity and reliability? Following repeated (within-day and across-day) exposures to 4 different ""motion profiles,"" subjects either (a) selected movies presented on a laptop computer, or (b) selected written descriptions from a booklet, or (c) generated self-motion verbal descriptions that corresponded most closely with their motion experience. One ""complexity"" and 2 reliability ""scores"" were calculated. Contrary to expectations, reliability and complexity scores were essentially equivalent for the animation movie selection and written report selection procedures. Verbal report generation subjects exhibited less complexity than did subjects in the other conditions and their reports were often ambiguous.

First we explored the impact of deliberate practice on pilot decision-making performance for crisis flying scenarios that had been practiced in their entirety. Then we looked at the impact of deliberate practice in which one aspect of the crisis scenario - the particular malfunction - was unpracticed. We analyzed pilot decision-making performance in response to 160 airborne mechanical malfunctions. We initially found that deliberate practice significantly improves decision-making performance for wholly practiced crises but does not improve decision-making performance when the specific malfunction has not been practiced. We then split decision making for each crisis into two phases: assessment and action selection. For wholly practiced crisis scenarios, additional deliberate practice positively impacts each decision-making phase. However, for part-practiced scenarios, deliberate practice appears to differentially affect phase of error. Specifically, pilots with more deliberate practice erred in action selection, whereas less-practiced pilots erred in assessment.

Through extensive research since 1977, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that the predominant underlying cause of these types of accidents involved decisional problems or cognitive information processing. To attack these problems, Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) training materials were developed and tested for ten years. Since the publication of the ADM training manuals in 1987, significant reductions in human performance error (HPE) accidents have been documented both in the U.S. and world wide. However, shortcomings have been observed in the use of these materials for recurrency training and in their relevance to more experienced pilots. The following discussion defines the differences between expert and novice decision makers from a cognitive information processing perspective, correlates the development of expert pilot cognitive processes with training and experience, and reviews accident scenarios which exemplify those processes. This introductory material is a necessary prerequisite to an understanding of how to formulate expert pilot decision making training innovations; and, to continue the record of improved safety through ADM training.</abstract>', '<title>Aeronautical decision making: Instructor-pilot evaluation of five Mnemonic methods</title> <abstract>Introduction: The ability to make good decisions is a critical component of pilot proficiency. Results of recent research suggest that aeronautical decision making (ADM) can be improved by training. The purposes of this research are to identify the best ADM mnemonic-based methods for training military pilots in decision making in tactical environments. Methods: There were 60 instructor pilots in the Republic of China Air Force Academy who evaluated the suitability of 5 different ADM methods including SHOR (Stimuli, Hypotheses, Options, Response); PASS (Problem identification, Acquire information, Survey strategy, Select strategy); FOR-DEC (Facts, Options, Risks & Benefits, Decision, Execution, Check); SOAR (Situation, Options, Act, Repeat); and DESIDE (Detect, Estimate, Set safety objectives, Identify, Do, Evaluate). Each was evaluated for six different types of decisions: go/no go; recognition-primed; response selection; resource management; non-diagnostic procedural; and creative problem-solving. Results: The instructor-pilots regarded the SHOR method as the best for time-limited and critical, urgent situations, while they preferred DESIDE for knowledge-based decisions that needed more comprehensive consideration and were less time limited. Discussion: To optimize training effectiveness, it is necessary to provide instruction based around both the SHOR and DESIDE decision-making mnemonic methods to provide comprehensive instruction for coping with all situations in the demanding military aviation environment.

This study investigated whether flight time, cognitive reflection, task-load, metacognition, and perceived stress predicted decision-making (DM) performance during two in-flight training simulations with 104 commercial pilots at Bogota International Airport. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the predictors accounted for 56% of the variance. Cognitive reflection, flight time and performance task load emerged as significant positive predictors. Cognitive reflection significantly moderated the relationship between flight time and DM performance, with pilots scoring lower on cognitive reflection showing improved DM with increased flight time, while controlling for performance task load. The study did not find significant relationships between stress metacognition and DM performance. The study emphasises the significance of advanced training methods in improving pilots’ DM, especially for those with low cognitive reflection. Future research should expand to multiple airlines, address gender balance, and incorporate direct measures of metacognitive monitoring. © 2024 The Author(s).

Background: The captain must quickly make appropriate decisions once an aircraft faces emergency. Usually, human error is one primary cause of accidents, which inevitably affects the captain’s decision progress. Method: Ten participants carried out a standard non-normal scenario (cargo smoke). Each participant is equipped with simulation experience and executed three sessions using three different decision models: the DOGAM, DECIDE, and CLEAR. After each session, the situation awareness (SA) and perceived workload were assessed using the Situational Awareness Rating Technology (SART) and NASA-TLX. An in-depth interview was also completed to comprehend their subjective perception of decision-making. Results: Although the CLEAR outperformed the other models in SART and NASA-TLX scores, their performance regarding workload and SA was comparable. The fixing time of DOGAM was the longest, and the other two models were no significant difference. Subjectively, the DECIDE may require a high mental demand by simultaneously processing lots of information and measuring significant changes, whilst the DOGAM may encourage participants follow their own idea, promoting aggressive decisions. Conclusion: This paper clarifies the importance of incorporating decision models into the cockpit and investigates the relatively feasible decision-making model. Variation across our results illustrated applying different decision models to train pilots and solve problems is suggested, thereby improving flight safety. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

Background: Air traffic control is an example of work in which operators have to schedule their tasks as a partially predictable work flow emerges. To date, little attention has been paid to such on-the-fly scheduling situations. Method: We present a series of discrete-event models fit to conflict resolution decision data collected from experienced controllers operating in a highfidelity simulation. Results: Our simulations reveal air traffic controllers\' scheduling decisions as examples of the partialorder planning approach of Hayes-Roth and Hayes- Roth. The most successful model uses opportunistic first-come-first-served scheduling to select tasks from a queue. Tasks with short deadlines are executed immediately. Tasks with long deadlines are evaluated to assess whether they need to be executed immediately or deferred.

Background: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance. Method: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to ""adaptable"") automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a ""level of automation"" as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook® is described. Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team\'s ""playbook."" Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles. Conclusion: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level. Application: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate.

DCS can sometimes be observed as a cluster of cases, which is referred to as epidemic DCS. In this report, we aim to evaluate an epidemic DCS episode that occurred following two consecutive HHT sessions. METHODS: A total of 16 trainees, all of whom were medical doctors, attended the aviation medicine training course in the aeromedical research and training center. They went through HHT in two sessions, each with eight trainees. RESULTS: Following two HHT sessions, five Type 1 DCS cases occurred among 18 personnel (16 trainees and 2 inside observers). DCS incidence rate was found to be 27.77%. They were successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). DISCUSSION: S ince the DCS incidence rate was found to be higher than the average in such a short period of time, this cluster of cases was labeled as epidemic DCS. We carried out a thorough investigation into all possible causes by following some templates that were developed to conduct comprehensive investigations into epidemic DCS episodes. According to the psychological arguments discussed here, we placed a special emphasis on hysterical and psychosocial components, among other probable factors. In cases where the possibility of hysteria and placebo-nocebo responses exist, it is appropriate to conduct the training and treatment processes with these factors in mind.

This ongoing change makes it a difficult condition to diagnose and even more difficult to identify. Both Flight Surgeons and Undersea Medical Officers (UMOs) must keep DCS on the differential. These two cases describe altitude DCS after unique pressure patterns, with one at a markedly lower than expected altitude for DCS. CASE REPORT: Both cases occurred in the F/A-18C and resulted in DCS requiring hyperbaric chamber treatment. The aviator in case 1 experienced an over-pressurization to an unknown depth with a subsequent rapid decompression during a carrier approach at 600 ft (182.9 m) above sea level. The aviator in case 2 experienced cabin pressure fluctuations between 9000 ft (2743.2 m) and 18,000 ft (5486.4 m). Both cases demonstrate the progression of DCS after partial treatment on ground-level oxygen therapy, and the case sequence illustrates how evaluations and protocols changed with experience. DISCUSSION: Decompression sickness is difficult to identify since it does not have a diagnostic test. These cases were even more difficult because of subtle exam findings, reliance on subjective symptoms, and atypical pressure profiles. Environmental, physiological, and psychosocial factors specific to the aviation community can delay the diagnosis and treatment. Descending in altitude and using in-flight emergency oxygen or ground-level oxygen partially treats and masks symptoms for both the aviator and the physician. The Flight Surgeons' integration within the squadron and collaboration with UMOs is important to identify the first signs of DCS and decrease time to treatment. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", '<title>A case of penetrating head wound due to helicopter rotor blade injury in a 34-year-old naval helicopter pilot who returned to active service 5 years later</title> <abstract>Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Head trauma, defined as damage to the brain, skull, or scalp when the head is hit by an external force, is a major cause of mortality in military personnel. Therefore, we report a novel case involving a naval helicopter pilot who sustained a helicopter propeller rotor blade injury. Case Report: We describe a case involving a pilot struck on the head by a helicopter rotor blade. He received care from medical staff shortly after the injury and was en route to the nearest trauma center. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a comminuted fracture of the right occipital bone, with bone fragment retention in the right cerebral hemispheres. We performed an emergency right occipital craniotomy. The visual field patterns demonstrated right homonymous hemianopia when the patient was discharged. The patient underwent delayed titanium mesh cranioplasty about 3 months after the right occipital craniotomy. From discharge to 5 years, the patient had performed rehabilitation exercise for at least 3 days every week. The patient’s continued recovery was confirmed at the 5-year follow-up in 2019. The bilateral visual acuity was 20/20, and the right homonymous hemianopia problem also disappeared. In the same year, after a physical and psychological assessment by an aviation doctor, he was able to resume flying. Conclusions: This report has shown that despite safety regulations for military and civilian helicopter personnel, which include the wearing of helmets, helicopter rotor blade injuries still occur and can have long-term consequences due to the severity of head injury. © 2021, International Scientific Information, Inc..

Effective pain relief was obtained with over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray. 2) A 49-yr-old man presented with a 3-yr history of flight-related headache that appeared at airplane touchdown, when he had mental stress, or when he was suffering from a lack of sleep. Pain was of a severe jabbing quality, localized over the forehead with no additional accompanying symptoms. He had a past history of episodic tension-type headache. Intracranial and paranasal CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Headache ceased spontaneously within 40 min of the end of the flight and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug premedication did not prevent the headache. Discussion: Sinus barotrauma was thought to be a plausible explanation for the headache in Case 1. In Case 2, an anxiety disorder could be considered as an underlying etiology. The etiology of so-called airplane headache is probably protean and this should be taken into account when assessing cases of in-flight cephalalgia. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

The relationship between auditory warning sound parameters and perceived urgency is, therefore, an important topic of enquiry in aviation psychology. The present investigation examined the relationship among subjective assessments of urgency, reaction time, and brainwave activity with three auditory warning signals. Subjects performed a tracking task involving automated and manual conditions, and were presented with auditory warnings having various levels of perceived and situational urgency. Subjective assessments revealed that subjects were able to rank warnings on an urgency scale, but rankings were altered after warnings were mapped to a situational urgency scale. Reaction times differed between automated and manual tracking task conditions, and physiological data showed attentional differences in response to perceived and situational warning urgency levels. This study shows that the use of physiological measures sensitive to attention and arousal, in conjunction with behavioural and subjective measures, may lead to the design of auditory warnings that produce a sense of urgency in an operator that matches the urgency of the situation. © 1995 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Cognitive Response Efficiency Under Varying Audiovisual Display Modalities of Flight Deck Warnings</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Warning information is mainly transmitted to pilots through visual and auditory forms in flight, with only a small portion transmitted through vibration. Poorly designed flight deck warnings have negative effects on pilot performance and safety. This study aimed to give insights into how different encoding forms of warnings act on pilot performance from a cognitive modeling perspective. METHODS: Four encoding forms were designed using voice prompts and flashing messages. An Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational based model was built to simulate the perception process. Flight simulator tests were carried out with four types of warnings triggered randomly for comparison with simulation results and thereby performed model validation. Statistical tests were performed to examine the significant differences and effect sizes. RESULTS: Both cognitive models (response time 0.82 ± 0.06 s with voice vs. 1.37 ± 0.09 s without voice in static forms; 1.35 ± 0.56 s with voice vs. 1.83 ± 0.32 s without voice in flashing forms) and subjects’ response time (1.42 ± 0.37 s with voice vs. 1.53 ± 0.42 s without voice in static forms; 1.43 ± 0.44 s with voice vs. 1.65 ± 0.43 s without voice in flashing forms) suggest the benefits of using voice prompts to improve performance, while flashing forms of warnings may impose an extra burden on cognition even though they bring the benefit of attracting attention. DISCUSSION: By carrying out a joint analysis with cognitive modeling and flight simulator tests, this work shows that designers can make use of alternative sensory channels for achieving a timely transfer of attention, but with a risk of increasing cognitive load. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Multisensory Cues for Encoding Urgency of System Hazards: Effect of Operator Experience on Perceived Urgency</title> <abstract>Objective: This study evaluated sonification and tactification for encoding urgency of system health status presented in the ground control station (GCS) visual interface of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and the observer’s perception of urgency. Background: The barrage of data in the GCS visual interface has the potential to isolate the operator from detecting system hazards that threatens the ability of the operator to operate the UAS effectively. Method: The pitch of the UAS’s engine revolutions per minute was mapped to a sonification, and excessive attitude upset of the UAS was mapped to a tactification in order to present a continuous awareness of the system’s health without being invasive and obtrusive. Participants with and without flying experience were required to monitor system health, while carrying out a secondary task. Results: Regardless of flying experience, sonification enhanced hazard detection compared to a visual-only GCS interface, but tactification did not aid performance. Conclusion: While multimodal displays have been studied in remotely piloted vehicles, this is the initial effort to demonstrate that sonification can influence perceived urgency leading to greater warning compliance. Further research is warranted to develop guidelines to ensure that non-visual signals can convey different levels of urgency for a continuous awareness of a system’s health, and thereby permit the operator to establish the appropriate level of priority to address the alarmed condition. © 2019, © 2019 Crown Copyright.</abstract>', '<title>Synthesized warning messages: effects of an alerting cue in single- and multiple-function voice synthesis systems</title> <abstract>The present study examined the effectiveness of preceding synthesized voice warning messages with an alerting cue as a function of the amount of information presented by the voice synthesizer and the workload level in the primary task.

Background: Teleoperation is a key operation during spaceflight. Comprehensive scientific evaluation techniques for teleoperation performance are important for astronaut selection and training. Method: Four categories of indices, i.e., completion performance, safety performance, subjective cognitive performance and physiological parameters, were adopted in this model. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to compute the weight coefficients of the indices to construct the linear performance model. Sixty-four male subjects were recruited to complete three teleoperation tasks, including point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance, in simulated environments. Their performance was rated by the researchers after the tasks. Results: The safety performance index had the highest weight coefficient (0.5274) of the first level indices, and the weight coefficient of the collisions index (0.8227) was the highest of the second level indices for safety performance. The linear performance model was constructed to calculate comprehensive performance values. Conclusion: Safety considerations are the most important factors for astronauts to consider in teleoperation. The collision of the robotic arm is the most vital safety index. The comprehensive value derived from the model was significantly related to overall performance. The validity of our model was verified, and it is anticipated that the model will be used to evaluate the performance of remote robotic arm operations. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Astronaut Candidate, Candidate-Like, and Undergraduate Subjects Compared on Retention and Transfer</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The present study examined long-term retention and transfer of knowledge and skills, as well as the effect of cognitive load on retention and transfer, using a sample of astronaut candidates and two comparison groups. The first comparison group, recruited from Johnson Space Center, was similar in age, education, and general health to the astronaut candidate group; the second comparison group included university undergraduate students. METHODS: This study employed two different tasks—a simple perceptual-motor task involving data entry and a complex memory updating task requiring both prospective and retrospective memory. Subjects completed multiple sessions involving both tasks over a 500-d period, with test sessions involving transfer and/or a cognitive load manipulation. For the perceptual-motor task, transfer involved changes to the stimuli that increased intrinsic cognitive load or changes to the required motoric procedures. For the memory updating task, extraneous cognitive load was increased by the addition of a concurrent secondary task. RESULTS: For both the perceptual-motor and memory updating tasks, astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects performed more accurately, with greater speed, and were less impacted by increased cognitive load than undergraduate students. Despite the generally superior performance of astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects, they were more likely to experience negative transfer on the perceptual-motor task, whereas undergraduate students demonstrated positive transfer. DISCUSSION: Candidate-like subjects provided a more accurate approximation of astronaut candidate performance than did undergraduate students, especially with regard to negative transfer effects and cognitive load. © copyright by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Personality Characteristics and Trait Clusters in Final Stage Astronaut Selection</title> <abstract>Introduction: This paper presents personality testing data from final stage applicants to the NASA astronaut program. Questions addressed include whether personality predicted final selection into the astronaut corps, whether women and men demonstrated typical gender differences in personality, and whether three characteristic clusters found in other high performance populations replicated in this group. Methods: Between 1989 and 1995, 259 final stage astronauts completed the Personal Characteristic Inventory (PCI) which assesses personality characteristics related to the broad traits of Instrumentality and Expressivity. In addition, 147 of these individuals also completed an abbreviated version of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) which assesses the ""Big Five"" traits of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, And Conscientiousness. Results: Three previously identified trait clusters (Right, Wrong, and No Stuff) were found to replicate in this population. No differences were found on the PCI or on the modified NEO-FFI between applicants who were chosen to become astronauts (n = 63) and those who were not (n = 196). Men scored higher than women on competitiveness, but lower on expressivity and achievement strivings. Discussion: These analyses suggest that the ""Right Stuff,"" ""Wrong Stuff"" and ""No Stuff"" clusters originally described in airline pilots and other high performance groups also exist within this population. Consistent with findings from other high performance populations, men and women tend to differ to a lesser extent than found in the general population, particularly on traits related to achievement motivation. Personality trait testing did not predict which applicants were most likely to be accepted into the astronaut corps.</abstract>', '<title>Association of individual characteristics with teleoperation performance</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: A number of space activities (e.g., extravehicular astronaut rescue, cooperation in satellite services, space station supplies, and assembly) are implemented directly or assisted by remote robotic arms. Our study aimed to reveal those individual characteristics which could positively influence or even predict teleoperation performance of such a space robotic arm. METHODS: There were 64 male volunteers without robot operation experience recruited for the study. Their individual characteristics were assessed, including spatial cognitive ability, cognitive style, and personality traits. The experimental tasks were three abstracted teleoperation tasks of a simulated space robotic arm: point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance. Teleoperation performance was measured from two aspects: task performance (completion time, extra distance moved, operation slips) and safety performance (collisions, joint limitations reached). The Pearson coefficients between individual characteristics and teleoperation performance were examined along with performance prediction models. RESULTS: It was found that the subjects with relatively high mental rotation ability or low neuroticism had both better task and safety performance (|r|=0.212~0.381). Subjects with relatively high perspective taking ability or high agreeableness had better task performance (r=20.253; r=20.249). Imagery subjects performed better than verbal subjects regarding both task and safety performance (|r|=0.236~0.290). Compared with analytic subjects, wholist subjects had better safety performance (r=0.300). Additionally, extraverted subjects had better task performance (r=20.259), but worse safety performance (r=0.230). CONCLUSIONS: Those with high spatial cognitive ability, imagery and wholist cognitive style, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness were seen to have more advantages in working with the remote robotic arm. These results could be helpful to astronaut selection and training for space station missions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

The nature of mass casualty incidents and the work environment can impact psychological resilience, but the psychological resilience of members of EMTs has not been evaluated. Context: In Singapore, EMTs are deployed from public hospitals, polyclinics and the Singapore Red Cross to disaster sites, where they triage, stabilize and treat casualties before evacuating them to public hospitals for further management. Action: Twenty-four members of EMTs responded to a cross-sectional survey based on a psychological resilience tool developed for health-care rescuers involved in mass casualty incidents to evaluate their psychological resilience after a full-scale exercise involving an aviation accident. Respondents completed a psychological resilience tool that was developed by experts in disaster work and research using a modified Delphi approach. There were 27 items across eight domains: optimism, altruism, preparations for disaster rescue, social support, perceived control, self-efficacy, coping strategies and positive growth. Outcome: The key observations from the survey were that (i) staff demonstrated a strong sense of altruism and had good social support; (ii) staff were not confident about their preparedness, and this led to a lack of optimism, perceived control and ability to deal with emotions; and (iii) it was necessary for respondents to reflect on their experience to find meaning to support growth after the deployment. Discussion: Optimizing casualty survival and outcomes during mass casualty incidents requires not only excellent procedural training and robust standard operating procedures and work processes but also dedicated efforts to enhance the psychological resilience of members of EMTs. © 2025, World Health Organization.

One type of influence on these interactions is conformity, whereby an individual changes his or her own behaviour to match incorrect responses of others in a group. Conformity to peer pressure has been replicated in experimental research conducted in many countries over the last 60 years. There is newly emerging empirical evidence of this effect in medical education, suggesting that subtle motivations and pressures within a group may prevent students from challenging or questioning information that seems incorrect. Objectives: This narrative review aims to present an overview of theory and findings in research into conformity in the fields of social psychology, business, sociology and aviation theory to demonstrate its direct relevance to medical education and the health professions. Methods: We searched online databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and ProQuest) from the University of Calgary catalogue. We also searched citations in articles reviewed and references provided by colleagues. We limited our narrative review to publications released between 1950 and 2012. Results: Group conformity behaviour may be one of a number of communication challenges associated with interprofessional care, and may represent a factor contributing to the burden of adverse events. This paper calls for a new programme of research into conformity in medical education that provides systematic empirical evidence of its relevance and applications in education, health care and practice. Conclusions: This review reveals decades of anecdotal and empirical evidence that conformity is a pervasive phenomenon across disciplines. Further research is needed to elucidate which situations pose the greatest risk for the occurrence of conformity, how to manage it in practice and its implications for patient safety. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>', ""<title>A cognitive blueprint of collaboration in context: Distributed cognition in the psychiatric emergency department</title> <abstract>Objective: The complex cognitive processes that underlie human performance in 'messy' contexts such as critical care medicine suggest a need for a cognitive model with broad scope to support the understanding of error in such domains. The objective of this research is to characterize the cognition that underlies patient care in the domain of emergency psychiatry in order to enhance the understanding of error in this context. Methods and materials: The theoretical framework of distributed cognition has been used to study collaborative decision-making in a number of similarly complex environments such as airline cockpits and air traffic control towers. These environments share certain characteristics with the critical care domain: the work is collaborative in nature, it is supported by artifacts that can be studied directly, and the consequences of error are dire. However, the nature of the work in this domain and the artifacts used to support it are unique. The application of the theoretical constructs of distributed cognition to this context is necessary in order to characterize the collective thinking that underlies critical care. Our research uses a combination of ethnographic and interview data to derive a distributed cognitive model of the psychiatric emergency department (PED), a high volume clinical unit dealing exclusively with the acute phases of psychiatric crises. The dynamics of workflow within the department are complex: several types of clinician collaborate by forming temporary multidisciplinary teams that attach to and manage particular patients. The component members of these teams change over time. Results: Using the theoretical framework of distributed cognition, we interpreted the collected data to derive a cognitive model of the distribution of work and information flow in the PED. This modeling process has revealed several latent flaws in the system related to the underlying distribution of cognition across teams, time, space and artifacts. Conclusions: The characterization of this distribution has enhanced our understanding of the cognitive dynamics underlying error in this environment, and will serve to guide future research on error management in the ED and inform the development of context-appropriate error-management systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A multi-professional qualitative study</title> <abstract>Background: Professional intrapersonal and interpersonal competences (IICs) form an important part of medical expertise but are given little attention during clinical training. In other professional fields such as psychotherapy, education and aviation, training in IICs is an integral part of education and practice. In medicine, IICs tend to actually decline during studies. To date it is unclear why IICs are given less attention in medicine, despite evidence for their importance in the treatment process. In view of this, the study examined the role of IICs in the treatment process, the current situation of IIC training in medicine and, most importantly, the reasons for the comparatively low focus on IICs in the clinical training of medical students. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 experts from a variety of medical specialties and non-medical professions that provide a training with a stronger focus on IIC development. The interviews were evaluated using grounded theory. Results: The experts confirmed the idea that IICs are an equally important component in the treatment process, along with medical knowledge and technical skills. They also described large differences between the IICs possessed by physicians but noted a general developmental need. The key shortcoming was perceived to be a deep-seated defensiveness towards learning from mistakes and deficits e.g. through reflection and feedback. The interaction of different factors that seem to be reasons for this defensiveness and perpetuate it were identified: lack of support in dealing with insecurities in the face of responsibility; the notion of medicine as a science with the categories of right and wrong answers; and a range of pressures arising from the setting, such as hierarchical, economic and competition pressures. Conclusion: Our study showed, that the defensive attitude towards learning from mistakes and deficits especially in the field of IICs appears to be a subtle but powerful obstacle for implementing IICs in medical training, in contrast to other professional fields. This obstacle is sustained by various underlying barrier factors. We therefore propose that changes should be made within a cultural transformation targeting this defensive mindset and culture and its presumed reasons. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract>', '<title>""You\'re a trainee telling your consultant to hold their question until later"": Using a resident-led faculty development workshop to explore trainee-consultant expertise role-reversal</title> <abstract>Background: Medical education traditionally involves directional flow of knowledge/skills/attitudes from a senior to junior individual. However, medical training also provides opportunities for expertise role-reversal, where the direction of flow is reversed. Unlike fields such as aviation, medicine has not yet begun to fully realise the educational potential of this approach. Objective: To better understand how role-reversal is viewed by medical education participants, necessary for its use as a tool to advance both education and patient care. Methods: A senior resident designed and led a feedback-writing workshop for her own consultants (conducted 2022). After the session, eight consultants were interviewed in a semi-structured format. Analysis was conducted using the Stenfors-Hayes phenomenographical approach. Results: A multiplicity of experiential perspectives was identified by both consultants (teacher/participant/supporter/hierarchy member/colleague/holder of multiple perspectives) and trainee (presenter/subordinate/learner/researcher). The exercise increased appreciation and awareness of the complexity of the trainee-consultant educational-power relationship, though both parties maintained traditional hierarchy despite altered informational flow. Participants often held multiple articulated experiential perspectives simultaneously. Conclusions: Consultants were able to assume a learning mindset while simultaneously maintaining awareness of their existing hierarchical relationship to the trainee-presenter; the trainee, conversely, struggled to adopt the teacher mindset. Deliberately viewing moments where trainees present new information to consultants as expertise role-reversal may provide a starting point for more equitable knowledge exchange between both parties in the clinical routine, and a foil for epistemic injustice. Increasing recognition and use of expertise role reversal can play a critical role in improving educational culture.; Hintergrund: Während der ärztlichen Ausbildung werden traditionellerweise Wissen und Fähigkeiten von erfahrenen Ärzt:innen und Fachkräften auf die auszubildenden Ärzt:innen übertragen. Die Ausbildung bietet jedoch auch Gelegenheiten zur didaktischen Rollenumkehr, wo ältere oder erfahrenere Ärzt:innen von jüngeren lernen. Im Gegensatz z.B. zur Luftfahrt, ist dieser Ansatz in der Medizin in seinem didaktischen Potential noch nicht gründlich erforscht. Zielsetzung: Die Zielsetzung dieser Studie ist es, zu untersuchen, wie Teilnehmende an einer ärztlichen Fortbildung eine didaktische Rollenumkehr erleben. Dies könnte sowohl in der Ausbildung als auch in der Praxis zu Verbesserungen der Zusammenarbeit und des Wissensaustauschs führen. Projektbeschreibung: Ein:e Ärzt:in im 2. Jahr ihrer Facharztausbildung (Onkologie, „resident“ im kanadischen Ausbildungssystem) führte eine an ihre Ausbilder („consultants“) gerichtete Fortbildung durch. Das Thema der Fortbildung war das Verfassen von schriftlichem Feedback. Acht an der Fortbildung teilnehmende Fachärzt:innen und die vortragende Ärzt:in nahmen danach an halbstrukturierten Interviews teil; die Daten wurden phenomenografisch nach Stenfor-Hayes ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Es konnten mehrere Perspektiven identifiziert werden, auf deren Basis die anwesenden Fachärzt:innen und die auszubildende Ärzt:in die Fortbildung bewerteten. Dazu gehörten: Lehrkraft, Workshop-Teilnehmer:in, Unterstützer:in, Kolleg:in, Vorgesetze:r innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie (Fachärzt:innen), bzw Vortragende, Untergebene, Forscher:in (vortragende Assistenzärzt:in). Teilnehmende beschrieben auch mehrere gleichzeitig eingenommene Perspektiven. Die Fortbildung führte allseits zu einer klaren Anerkennung und tieferem Verständnis des Arbeitsverhältnisses und der Ausbildungsverantwortung zwischen Lehrkräften und Auszubildenden. Die deutlich unterschiedlichen Positionen in der traditionellen Hierarchie wurden jedoch durchweg gefühlt eingehalten, trotz der umgekehrten Richtung der didaktischen Tätigkeit. Schlussfolgerung: Fachärzt:innen und auch der/die anwesende Chefärzt:in konnten sich in die Rolle der/des Lernenden hineinversetzen, obwohl sie sich gleichzeitig der Verantwortung und Weisungsbefugtheit gegenüber der auszubildenden Ärzt:in bewusst waren. Diese jedoch tat sich zunächst schwer damit, innerlich die Rolle der Lehrkraft einzunehmen. Im klinischen Alltag gibt es häufig Situationen, in denen Assistenzärzt:innen, PJler, usw Fachärzt:innen oder Chefärzt:innen neue oder zusätzlich Informationen zu ihren Patienten geben, und solche Situationen könnten auch als didaktische Rollenumkehr aufgefasst werden. Falls eine situationsbezogen bewusste didaktische Rollenumkehr zu einer akzeptierten Praxis während der ärztliche Ausbildung werden sollte, könnte dies auch der epistemischen Ungerechtigkeit entgegenwirken, die sonst leicht aufgrund der Differenzen innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie auftreten kann und etwaige wichtige Beiträge und Einblicke innerhalb eines Teams unterbinden kann. © © 2025 Preti et al.</abstract>']"

One particularly interesting example is that manual rotation actions facilitate mental rotations in the same direction. The present study extends this research in two fundamental ways. First, Experiment 1 demonstrates that not only manual rotations facilitate mental rotations but that mental rotations also facilitate subsequent manual rotations. Second, Experiments 2 and 3 targeted the mechanisms underlying this interplay. Here, manual steering wheel rotations produced salient visual effects, namely the rotation of either a plane or a horizon in an aviation display. The rotation direction of these visual effects either did or did not correspond to the direction of the manual rotation itself. These experiments clearly demonstrate an impact of sensory action effects: Mental rotations facilitate manual rotations with visual effects of the same direction (as the mental rotation), irrespective of the direction of the manual rotation. These findings highlight the importance of effect anticipation in action planning. As such they support the contentions of ideomotor theory and shed new light on the cognitive source of the interplay between visual imagery and motor control. © 2012 American Psychological Association.</abstract>', '<title>The effects of repeated rotary acceleration on the oculo-gyral illusion</title> <abstract>""The effects of repeated angular acceleration and deceleration on visual perception were studied in three subjects to establish whether any change in the oculo-gyral illusion would occur\xa0.\xa0.\xa0...

Some students were trained in a control condition with no visual display. Transfer was assessed in the airplane in relation to the amount of landing training required prior to release for solo. Training with a low-detail scene was better for transfer than was training with a moderate-detail scene. An interaction between scene detail and augmented guidance showed that augmented guidance enhanced transfer when used in training with a low-detail scene but degraded transfer when used in training with a moderate-detail scene.

Visual displays simulated landing approaches with trial-to-trial variations in glideslope, lighting, and scene detail. Twenty-four participants (8 private pilots, 8 student pilots, and 8 nonpilots) were instructed to initiate the flare when they perceived that their TTC with the runway (30 m wide by 840 m long) had reached a critical value of 2 seconds. Our results demonstrated a significant effect of flight experience on flare timing accuracy and dominance of the height-based strategy over the runway-width-angle and TTC-based strategies. © 2008 American Psychological Association.</abstract>', '<title>Visual Augmentation and Scene Detail Effects in Flight Training</title> <abstract>Flight students were taught landings in a flight simulator with a visual landing display to examine the effects of scene detail, visual augmentation (prediction and guidance), and speed of roll response on the acquisition and transfer of landing skills. Transfer was from moderate-detail and low-detail scenes; from constant, adaptive, and no visual augmentation; and from fast, normal, and slow roll response. Transfer was assessed in the simulator with a moderate-detail pictorial scene, no visual augmentation, and a normal roll response. Training with visual augmentation was superior to training without it, although a Scene Detail x Visual Augmentation interaction revealed that the nonpredictive guidance augmentation enhanced transfer only when it was combined in training with the low-detail scene. Transfer from a low-detail, unaugmented display was poor, and there was some evidence of poor transfer from a fast roll response. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In both cases, a very important question for designers of such displays is which elements of pictorial detail in the presented image are needed for satisfactory task or mission performance. Two elements of pictorial detail, a visible runway outline and ground texture, are considered in this article. An experiment is described in which the participants were required to initiate the landing maneuver during a simplified aircraft-landing task. This experiment was developed with 2 goals in mind: The first objective was to determine whether performance was influenced by the addition of ground texture; a second objective was to find out whether participants based their timing of the initiation of the landing maneuver on altitude perception or on the so-called time-to-contact (TTC; Lee, 1974). In the landing case, TTC is defined as the time remaining to the moment that the wheels make contact with the runway if no pilot action is taken. The results of the experiment show that landing performance is improved when ground texture is added to the display. The results also suggest that participants change their timing behavior from a strategy based on altitude perception when only a runway outline is present, to one based on TTC perception when texture is added to the display.</abstract>', '<title>Progress in the development of guidance strategies for the landing flare manoeuvre using tau-based parameters</title> <abstract>Purpose – To provide a progress report into research conducted to establish guidelines for the development of guidance vision aids. Design/methodology/approach – The first stage of the research is to establish a coherent engineering basis for the methods of (visual) motion perception and control to inform the design of pilot aids that will support flight in degraded visual conditions, particularly when close to the ground. The next stage will then be to construct and evaluate synthetic displays that recover the visual cues necessary to allow flight in degraded visual conditions for a range of manoeuvres using the flight simulation facilities at the University of Liverpool (UoL). The research is guided by tau (time to contact) theory from the field of ecological psychology. Findings – The closure of spatial gaps for a number of aircraft manoeuvres are presented in the tau domain. Analysis of the landing flare manoeuvre suggest that both a constant rate of change of tau strategy and an intrinsic tau-guidance strategy will yield benefits in terms of touchdown descent rate if presented as display symbology. Research limitations/implications – Results are presented from trials where only one professional pilot was used. Results from a wider population of pilots need to be analysed to ensure that the observed trends are generic. Practical implications – The reported results are being used in the next phase of the research project to inform the design of a guidance vision-aid for the flare manoeuvre. These displays will be tested in flight simulation trials. Originality/value – The research takes a theory of motion perception and applies it to aircraft guidance display technology. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited</abstract>']"

The primary focus was on identifying factors linked to pilots' Job Satisfaction differentiations over the time course of the pandemic, and proposing measures to mitigate their negative effects. Survey Job Satisfaction data were collected from 203 pilots during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021, and were subsequently measured in a quasi-identical sample of 205 pilots after the pandemic in May 2023. During the pandemic, the results indicate that airline pilots experienced an acute decrease in Job Satisfaction due to the disruptive nature of COVID-19. This decline was primarily attributed to factors such as pay cuts and reduced promotion prospects, which consequently resulted in feelings of limited job security and future uncertainty. Importantly, a substantial recovery of airline pilots JS was observed following the end of the pandemic. In contrast, military pilots' levels remained relatively constant over the duration of the pandemic, as military organizations typically received government provided financial security. To improve commercial sustainability, it is recommended that airline companies enhance their preparedness for future crises by minimizing the financial impact experienced by pilots. Additionally, effective communication strategies should be implemented to address and alleviate uncertainty among pilots. It is crucial to prevent adverse psychological conditions among pilots, as they play a critical role in maintaining flight safety. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>"", '<title>Impact of COVID-19 on Job Satisfaction: The Case of Military and Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the military and airline pilots’ Job Satisfaction (JS), and identify important contributory factors to support the development of future mitigating strategies. Background: The aviation industry has undergone a series of devastating changes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the implications of the pandemic on pilots’ JS are unknown. Methods: Quantitative JS measurements were taken from 203 European and Middle Eastern pilots, during the pandemic (March, 2021), using the shortened Job Descriptive Index and Job In General validated scales. Follow-up semi-structured interviews (April 2021) were conducted with 16 participants to establish pre-pandemic JS levels and identify the degree of change due to COVID-19. Results: Significant JS differences (p <\xa0.001) were observed between military and airline pilots; the former having higher levels. Qualitative findings revealed that airline pilots’ levels decreased due to factors such as job security, pay cuts, opportunities for promotion and skill-fade concerns. Military pilots experienced an increased JS, as state-funded organizations were not substantially affected by COVID-19, which led to a feeling of appreciation and thankfulness. Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to JS of military and airline pilots. Suggested mitigation measures for the civil aviation sector comprised effective communication between pilots and managers to reduce the pandemic-induced job uncertainty. Solutions such as extra flight simulator sorties were recommended to tackle the skill-fade effect. © 2022 The Author(s).

Material and Methods: The study involved 930 Polish soldiers –members of aircrew. The study was conducted by using a survey designed by the author, as part of the implementation of the National Health Programme 2021–2025. The survey used the research technique computer assisted web interview. Results: Approximately half of the soldiers surveyed (49%) declared that they did not contract COVID-19. Analysis of the results on the frequency of consumption of selected food items showed that most food items respondents consumed at similar levels during the pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period. There was a positive increase in the frequency of consumption of nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables in 14.8%, 15.9% and 19% of respondents, respectively. More than 20% of those surveyed declared that they consumed less restaurant meals, fast food, sweets and sugary drinks. The vast majority of the respondents (77.6%) answered that they did not feel more negative emotions compared to the pre-pandemic period COVID-19 and emotions did not affect their diet. The frequency of physical activity remained the same for 71.9% of soldiers, while 14.9% respondents said they played sport less often than before the pandemic. Overweight was diagnosed in 50.2% of respondents, while 12.8% were obese. More than half of the respondents (56%) declared that their weight had not changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, 25.1% declared that their weight had increased and 8.9% that it had decreased. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic condition did not disrupt the existing lifestyles of most military flying personnel. More than half of the military flying personnel surveyed reported no effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight change. A quarter of soldiers reported weight gain, which was associated with negative changes in diet and physical activity. © 2025, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. Objective To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. Design An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. Setting Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) Participants 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. Results The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p = 0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p = 0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively). The aircrews were satisfied with the protocol and provided several practical suggestions. Conclusion The protocol was well received by the passengers and aircrews of the repatriation flights with some suggestions for improvement. © 2020 Pongpirul et al.

Analysis of safety resilience in flight operations during COVID-19 disruptions</title> <abstract>The unexpected spread of the pandemic raised concerns regarding pilots’ skill decay resulting from the significant drops in the frequency of flights by about 70%. This research retrieved 4761 Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) occurrences based on the FDM programme containing 123,140 flights operated by an international airline between June 2019 and May 2021. The FDM severity index was analysed by event category, aircraft type, and flight phase. The results demonstrate an increase in severity score from the pre-pandemic level to the pandemic onset on events that occurred on different flight phases. This trend is not present in the third stage, which indicates that pilots and the safety management system of the airline demonstrated resilience to cope with the flight disruptions during the pandemic. Through the analysis of event severity, FDM enables safety managers to recommend measures to increase safety resilience and self-monitoring capabilities of both operators and regulators. Practitioner summary: The onset of the pandemic led to a rise in the severity of flight data monitoring events in a large airline, likely linked to a lack of operational practice and skills decay. This was demonstrated across different flight phases and aircraft types. In the settled pandemic period, the severity index returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the resilience of individual pilots and safety management systems is critical to operational safety.HIGHLIGHTS The FDM event severity scores significantly increased following the pandemic onset, especially for event categories involving pilot core competencies. The FDM event severity scores stagnated or decreased during the later pandemic stage indicating resilience among the airline pilots and the airline’s safety management system. The airline and pilots demonstrated resilience by effectively mitigating the effects of proficiency decay which took place as the pandemic started. FDM analysis has shown to be effective in establishing a proactive SMS programme to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on aviation safety. © 2023 The Author(s).

Background: Periods of persistent, intensive work demands are known to compromise recovery and attentional capacity. The effects of 4-month MT on salivary cortisol and performance on 2 computer-based cognitive tasks were tested on a military helicopter unit exposed to a prolonged period of high workload. Methods: MT participants were compared to a wait list control group on levels of saliva cortisol and performance on a go–no go test and a test of stimulus-driven attentional capture. Participants also reported mental demands on the go–no go test, time of wakeup, sleep duration, quality of sleep, outcome expectancies, physical activity level, self-perceived mindfulness, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The results from a mixed between–within analysis revealed that the MT participants compared to the control group had a larger pre to post increase in high- and low-cortisol slopes, and decrease in perceived mental demand imposed by the go–no go test. Conclusion: MT alleviates some of the physiological stress response and the subjective mental demands of challenging tasks in a military helicopter unit during a period of high workload. © 2016, Anders Meland, Kazuma Ishimatsu, Anne Marte Pensgaard, Anthony Wagstaff, Vivianne Fonne, Anne Helene Garde, and Anette Harris.</abstract>', '<title>Exploring the relationship between trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation from a network perspective: is there any difference between pilots and other non-pilot civil aviation employees?</title> <abstract>To explore the role of trait mindfulness in the psychological adaptation of civil aviation personnel, and compare the importance of this role between airline pilots and other civil aviation practitioners. A total of 198 civil aviation pilots and 804 other civil aviation practitioners were recruited to complete surveys on mindfulness, SCL-90, job burnout, core self-evaluation, and psychological resilience. The network relationship between trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation was constructed. The results showed that trait mindfulness played an important role in the psychological adaptation network of civil aviation employees. Specifically, trait mindfulness was negatively correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and emotional exhaustion, and positively correlated with core self-evaluation. However, no significant difference was found in trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation network between pilots and non-pilots. These findings show that mindfulness has a unique positive effect on the psychological adaptation of civil aviation personnel. Specifically, the mindfulness trait may alleviate compulsive symptoms or reduce emotional exhaustion, enabling airline personnel to maintain a good self-evaluation. At the same time, the role of mindfulness traits in the network is similar, indicating that the positive role of mindfulness intervention in civil aviation may be universal. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract>', '<title>Effects of animated pedagogical agent-guided loving-kindness meditation on flight attendants’ spirituality, mindfulness, subjective wellbeing, and social presence</title> <abstract>Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) was first practiced by Buddhists and then developed by clinical psychologist. Previous studies on LKM have mainly focused on the impact of real person-guided meditation on depression, anxiety, and other negative psychology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explored the effect and mechanism of media-guided LKM on the improvement of social presence, mindfulness, spirituality, and subjective wellbeing (SWB). From the viewpoint of positive psychology, this study compared the different media effects of animated pedagogical agent (APA)-guided LKM and audio-guided LKM. A total of 82 flight attendants were recruited from airlines; then, they were randomly assigned to two groups: APA group (41 participants) and audio group (41 participants), which both underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention. The aforementioned four main variables were measured pre and post the meditation experiment. The results indicated that both APA-guided meditation and audio-guided meditation significantly improved subjects’ spirituality and SWB. Compared with audio-guided meditation, APA-guided meditation significantly improved the subjects’ spirituality, SWB, and social presence. Audio-guided meditation has no significant effect on social presence. This study highlights APA-guided meditation has a positive effect on spirituality, SWB, and social presence, which may provide individuals with a simple and easy method to improve their mental health. © © 2022 Liu, Chen, Zhou, Chiang, Chen, Wu, Huang, Liu and Chiou.</abstract>', '<title>A Sense of Fellowship: Mindfulness Improves Experienced Interpersonal Benefits and Prosociality in A Military Aviation Unit</title> <abstract>Objective: Explore how personnel in a military aviation unit experienced personal as well as interpersonal aspects concerning their participation in a group-based four-month MBT programme. Background: mindfulness-based training (MBT) have been used as a personal stress management tool in stressful working environments, including military aviation. There is little knowledge about the interpersonal mechanisms involved when engaging in MBT. Method: Adhering to Grounded Theory (GT), we conducted post-intervention interviews with 42 programme participants. We selected 30 interviews with evidence of interpersonal effects for in-depth analyses to build a theoretical model of the pathways through which interpersonal effects might develop. Results: The majority of the interviewees (30/42\xa0= 71%) experienced significant interpersonal effects from MBT. The in-depth analyses revealed an increase in the common theme “Sense of Fellowship” (SOF). SOF comprised three primary change processes: “Attention to others,” “Self-observation” and “Reflection.” In addition, five behavioral changes emerged: “Direct communication,” “Increased patience,” “Decreased anger expression,” “Calmness,” and “Acceptance.” Finally, four contextual factors appeared to have particular importance for the development of SOF: “Plenary sessions,” “Sharing experiences,” “Doing something new together,” and “Sitting in silence.” Conclusion: These findings indicate that MBT has prosocial effects in a military aviation setting, and the constructed model contributes theoretically by suggesting how these psychosocial effects may arise and develop. © 2021 The Author(s).

Sixty-nine male subjects practising several occupations (air traffic controllers, railway station controllers, managers, chemical operators, etc.) participated in the study. The common characteristic of all jobs was the presence of neuro-emotional strain of various degrees. The ECG Holter Medilog 4500 system was used for monitoring the HR during the working day. The HR at work was applied as a single dependent variable in the multiple regression analysis and the independent contribution of the following variables was evaluated: HR at rest, neuroticism and Type A behaviour pattern. They appeared to be the most significant determinants in this model and explained about 23% of the variation in HR during work. As second-rank predictors, age and leisure time physical activity led to a non-essential increase (up to 25%) of the multiple regression coefficient.

Method The voices of a group of 45 ATCs were recorded before and after a 2-hour shift, regardless of their operational position or number of previously worked shifts; both genders were included, participants had a mean age of 25 years, and they had a mean length of occupational experience of 4 years and 2 months. Each of these professionals was recorded phonating a sustained /a/ vowel and counting from 1 to 20, and the recordings were acoustically analyzed using the Praat software. A perceptual-auditory analysis of the recordings was then performed by three speech therapists specializing in voice, who evaluated the characteristics of each emission using a visual analog scale (VAS). The acoustic analysis was performed on the sustained /a/ vowel. The measures of intensity; frequency; maximum phonation time (MPT); and the first, second, third, and fourth formants were considered in this analysis. Results There were no significant differences between the random pre- and postshift samples, either in the acoustic or in the perceptual-auditory analysis. The perceptual-auditory analysis revealed that 44% (n\u2009=\u200920) of ATCs showed alterations in vocal quality during the sustained /a/ vowel emission, and this dysphonia was also observed in connected speech in 25% (n\u2009=\u20095) of this group.

During two one-hour work sessions continuous EKG, ear pulse, and audio recordings were obtained individually from 24 male ATCs. In one session the controller actively controlled aircraft, while in the other he worked in a support/coordinator position. Session time in both conditions was partitioned on the basis of audio recordings into four mutually exclusive activities: Radio/Phone Talk, Radio/Phone Listening, Casual Talk, and Silence. Change in cardiovascular response pattern as a function of these activities, as well as the influence of a series of moderator variables on cardiovascular response, was assessed by examining heart rate (HR) and the EKG R-wave to ear pulse interval (RPI) relative to a pre-session baseline. The RPI index was employed as a means of unobtrusively tracking blood pressure on a beat-by-beat basis. Although reliable, the overall changes in CVS response were modest. Speech-associated reactivity was expressed exclusively by the RPI index. HR changes were not evident in response to speech, rather, the HR index appeared to be most sensitive to situational demand. Discrepancies between the present pattern and magnitude of speech-associated CVS response and those reported previously are discussed in terms of the nature of speech in laboratory versus field settings and measurement methodologies.</abstract>', '<title>A wearable system for the stress monitoring of air traffic controllers during an air traffic control refresher training and the trier social stress test: A comparative study</title> <abstract>Background: Air Traffic Control (ATC) is a complex and demanding process, exposing Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) to high stress. Recently, efforts have been made in ATC to maintain safety and efficiency in the face of increasing air traffic demands. Computer simulations have been a useful tool for ATC training, improving ATCs skills and consequently traffic safety. Objectives: This study aims to: a) evaluate psychophysiological indices of stress in an ATC simulation environment using a wearable biomonitoring platform. In order to obtain a measure of ATCs stress levels, results from an experimental study with the same participants, that included a stress-induced task were used as a stress ground truth; b) understand if there are differences in stress levels of ATCs with different job functions (“advisors” vs “operationals”) when performing an ATC Refresher Training, in a simulator environment. Methods: Two studies were conducted with ATCs: Study 1, that included a stress-induced task - the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and Study 2, that included an ATC simulation task. Linear Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features from ATCs were acquired using a medical grade wearable Electrocardiogram (ECG) device. Self-reports were used to measure perceived stress. Results: TSST was self-reported as being much more stressful than the simulation task. Physiological data supports these results. Results from study 2 showed more stress among the “advisors” group when comparing to the “operational” group. Conclusion: Results point to the importance of the development of quantified Occupational Health (qOHealth) devices to allow monitoring and differentiation of ATCs stress responses. © 2018 Donato and Denaro.</abstract>', '<title>Auditory skills of figure-ground and closure in air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>Purpose: To investigate the auditory skills of closure and figure-ground and factors associated with health, communication, and attention in air traffic controllers, and compare these variables with those of other civil and military servants. Methods: Study participants were sixty adults with normal audiometric thresholds divided into two groups matched for age and gender: study group (SG), comprising 30 air traffic controllers and control group (CG), composed of 30 other military and civil servants. All participants were asked a number of questions regarding their health, communication, and attention, and underwent the Speech-in-Noise Test (SIN) to assess their closure skills and the Synthetic Sentence Identification Test - Ipsilateral Competitive Message (SSI-ICM) in monotic listening to evaluate their figure-ground abilities. Data were compared using nonparametric statistical tests and logistic regression analysis. Results: More individuals in the SG reported fatigue and/or burnout and work-related stress and showed better performance than that of individuals in the CG for the figure-ground ability. Both groups performed similarly and satisfactorily in the other hearing tests. The odds ratio for participants belonging in the SG was 5.59 and 1.24 times regarding work-related stress and SSI-ICM (right ear), respectively.

When part of the control was released by allowing the subjects to sleep beyond 7 a.m., they slept an average of 67 min longer and showed sleep latencies which averaged 73 min. From these data it is concluded that control of the sleep portion of the sleep wakefulness cycle, particularly control of the wake up time, is sufficient to contain the free running sleep wakefulness rhythm to a 24 hr cycle.</abstract>', '<title>The use of constant routines in unmasking the endogenous component of human circadian rhythms</title> <abstract>A major problem in the study of the internal clock(s) that drives human circadian rhythms is that due to the effect produced by rhythmicity of habits and external influences (""masking"" A particularly potent factor in this respect is the sleep-wake cycle.

An account is given of the different circumstances in which the constant routines have been used together with the results derived from such studies. Briefly, they indicate that nychthemeral studies can give misleading information about the rate of adjustment of the internal clock to various manipulations, e.g. time-zone transition, shift work.

Six job stressors were identified through a literature review and focus group interviews. To determine the causal relationships, a survey was conducted from February 8 to April 9, 2022, targeting Korean cabin crew members in Middle Eastern airlines. A total of 201 valid samples were used for the statistical analysis. The findings revealed that flight attendants' job stress negatively impacts their mental health, while mental health deterioration positively impacts service sabotage behavior. Job insecurity, vertical communication, and acculturation stress negatively impacts flight attendants' mental health. The findings indicate that mental health deterioration is important in mediating the relationship between job stress and service sabotage. Finally, it is confirmed that there are differences in job stress, mental health deterioration, and service sabotage based on various demographic and occupational characteristics. This study is noteworthy because it approaches the dependent variable of job stress from the perspective of employees’ mental health rather than job-related variables. Service sabotage is introduced as a new variable because this behavior by flight attendants, whose primary job is to interact with customers, can have serious consequences for airline organizations and customers alike. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"", '<title>Self perceived health and mental health among women flight attendants</title> <abstract>Aims: The authors investigated associations of work related risk factors with self perceived health as less than ""good"" and psychological distress among Italian women flight attendants. Methods: The authors conducted a cross sectional survey on health and mental health among 1955 former and current flight attendants, using a postal questionnaire. Results: More current than former flight attendants reported self perceived health as fair to poor and psychological distress measured as a GHQ-12 score of six or more. Among current flight attendants, reporting health as fair to poor was associated with low job satisfaction (OR 1.89) and recent experiences of sexual harassment by passengers (OR 2.83). Psychological distress was associated with low job satisfaction (OR 2.38) and frequent tension with partner over childcare (OR 1.79). Conclusions: Perceived health as fair to poor and psychological distress were greater among current flight attendants and were related to job characteristics and family difficulties. Perceived poor health has been shown in the literature to be related to mortality, high job strain, and early retirement, and psychological distress is associated with work absence. The effect of sexual harassment by passengers on perceived health of flight attendants may be relevant to other working women dealing with the public.

Flight attendants are a predominantly female workforce with an occupational heritage of female and male sexualized stereotypes. Method: Data represented perception and prevalence of sexual harassment related to hostile work environment among 8,700 North American (U.S. and Canada) and 1,887 United Kingdom (UK) flight attendants in the Flight Attendant Health Study. Results: Sexual harassment, mostly from passengers, pilots, and coworkers, was reported by 26% of North American flight attendants and 11% of UK flight attendants. Yet, 61% of UK flight attendants experienced unwanted sexual behaviors, pointing to possible underreporting of the sexual harassment problem. Sexually offensive behaviors received variable labeling as sexual harassment depending on gender of the victim and perpetrator profile. Conclusion: Sexual harassment is a potentially underreported workplace problem for flight attendants with underreporting resulting from gender-specific differences in individual perceptions. Understanding these differences is vital to addressing sexual harassment and the concomitant health risks. Traditional client and customer attitudes might lead to rose-colored victims’ judgment, especially in the case of customer service jobs involving emotional labor.

Flight attendants are an understudied occupational group and are susceptible to harassment due to working in a feminized, client-facing occupation with few protections or sanctioned responses against aggressive behaviors. Objective: We investigated the relationship between workplace abuse and health in a cohort of cabin crew. We also aimed to characterize perpetrator profiles. Methods: We conducted our study among 4,459U.S. and Canada-based participants from the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study using multivariate logistic regression. Our exposures of interest were episodes of workplace abuse in the past year. We evaluated several mental and physical health outcomes, including depression, fatigue, musculoskeletal injuries, and general workplace injuries. Results: We report that exposures to verbal abuse, sexual harassment, and sexual assault are common among cabin crew, with 63, 26, and 2% of respondents, respectively, reporting harassment in the past year alone. Workplace abuse was associated with depression, sleep disturbances, and musculoskeletal injuries among male and female crew, with a trend toward increasing odds ratios (ORs) given a higher frequency of events. For example, sexual harassment was related to an increased odds for depression (OR = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-2.30), which increased in a dose response-like manner among women reporting harassment once (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.93-1.95), 2-3 times (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.29-2.38), and 4 or more times (OR = 4.12, 95% CI: 3.18-5.06). We found that passengers were the primary perpetrators of abuse. Conclusions: Our study is the first to comprehensively characterize workplace abuse and harassment and its relation to health in a largely female customer-facing workforce. The strong associations with health outcomes observed in our study highlights the question of how workplace policies can be altered to mitigate prevalent abuses. Clinicians could also consider how jobs with high emotional labor demands may predispose people to adverse health outcomes, educate patients regarding their psychological/physical responses and coping strategies, and be aware of signs of distress in patients working in such occupations in order to direct them to the appropriate treatments and therapies. © 2019 Gale, Mordukhovich, Newlan and McNeely.</abstract>', '<title>Integrating qualitative methods into occupational health research: A study of women flight attendants</title> <abstract>Aims: To identify possible work related sources of psychosocial stress in order to develop pertinent questionnaire items for a cross-sectional health survey of 3000 Italian women flight attendants, and to solicit suggestions on improving survey participation. Methods: Qualitative study in which 26 current and former women flight attendants participated: three focus groups of 6-7 participants each and six in-depth individual interviews. The session themes included positive and negative aspects of the job; relationships with colleagues, superiors, and passengers; perception of occupational risk for serious diseases; compatibility of work and family; and experiences of work related sources of stress and their effect on health. A transcript based analysis of the focus groups and interviews was used to identify emerging themes related to risk factors for mental health problems. Results: The participants indicated that mental health was a major concern. Several work related risk factors possibly related to adverse outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, were highlighted. These included isolation and solitude, fears of being inadequate partners and mothers due to job demands, passenger relationships, and lack of protection by employers with respect to workplace exposures and violent passengers. The information gained was used to develop a mental health module for inclusion in the health survey questionnaire which included questions on history of severe depression or anxiety, suicidal ideation or attempt, substance abuse, workplace sexual harassment, social support, leisure time activities, relationship with a partner, and role as mother. Conclusions: Employing qualitative methods to identify work related sources of psychosocial stress enabled development of pertinent questionnaire items for a cross-sectional epidemiological study of women flight attendants.

Demographic characteristics and standardized questionnaires, including the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist and the Psychotherapy Outcome Assessment and Monitoring System-Trauma Version, were sent in June 2002 to approximately 26,000 AA flight attendants. Of the 2050 respondents, 18.2% reported symptoms consistent with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Those living alone were 1.48 times more likely to have a probable PTSD diagnosis than those living with someone else. Age or years of service as a flight attendant did not predict probable PTSD; however, marital status did. Substance abuse was not endorsed as a coping strategy. Given the traumatic events experienced by AA flight attendants, and persistent threats of future terrorist attacks, these results reveal that additional assessment and treatment interventions for stress-related symptoms in this population seem warranted.</abstract>', '<title>PTSD reactions and coping responses of American Airlines flight attendants who were former employees of Trans World Airlines: Further support of a psychological contagion effect</title> <abstract>Previous findings comparing the psychological reactions and functional coping of East Coast- and West Coast-based American Airlines (AA) flight attendants after the attacks on September 11 provide support for a psychological contagion phenomenon (Lating, Sherman, Lowry, Everly, & Peragine, 2004). The purpose of this investigation was to expand these results by creating an additional comparison group consisting of current AA flight attendants not working on either the East Coast or the West Coast and who were also previously working for Trans World Airlines (TWA) before AA took over operating authority in April 2001. As predicted, the results revealed that the rate of probable posttraumatic stress disorder for the former TWA flight attendants (15.1%) was not significantly different from the East Coast and the West Coast AA flight attendants. Moreover, there were no significant differences among the three groups on measures of life functioning, and as hypothesized, there was no difference between the West Coast-based flight crews and the former TWA flight attendants in whether they knew someone who lost his or her life in the aftermath of September 11.

The objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of the post-accident sequelae for professionals who have survived AMT accidents. The hope is that this understanding will empower the industry to better support survivors and plan for the contingencies of post-accident recovery.Methods: Qualitative methods were used to explore the experience of flight crew members who have survived an AMT accident. ""Accident"" was defined using criteria established by the National Transportation Safety Board. Traditional focus group methodology explored the survivors\' experiences following the accident.Results: Seven survivors participated in the focus group. Content analysis revealed themes in four major domains that described the experience of survivors: Physical, Psychological, Relational and Financial. Across the themes survivors reported that industry and company response varied greatly, ranging from generous support, understanding and action to make safety improvements, to little response or action and lack of attention to survivor needs.Conclusion: Planning for AMT post-accident response was identified to be lacking in scope and quality. More focused efforts are needed to assist and support the survivors as they regain both their personal and professional lives following the accident. This planning should include all stakeholders in safe transport; the individual crewmember, air medical transport companies, and the industry at large.</abstract>', '<title>PTSD reactions and coping responses of East Coast and West Coast American airlines flight attendants after September 11: A possible psychological contagion effect?</title> <abstract>Psychological reactions and functional coping of East Coast and West Coast-based flight attendants were compared after the attacks on September 11.

Moreover, corporate aviation departments and commercial air carriers have vested interests in hiring those applicants who have the propensity to perform effectively in a team environment. As a continuation of ongoing research in pilot resource selection, the authors have examined the efficacy of binary logistic regression in screening candidates for instructor pilot upgrade by analyzing psychological surveys of 77 commercial pilots based on the Big Five Personality Inventory, the Leadership Intelligence Quotient (LIQ) Self-Assessment and three select attribute scales (Mach V, locus-of-control, and self-monitoring scales). Results of this research indicated a significant relationship between leader decision-making and personality attributes complementing team formation. In this particular study, 36 experienced instructor pilots and 41 line pilots were categorized with an overall accuracy of 93 percent employing a two-variable model based on Machiavellian view and self-monitoring as independent or predictor variables. These results underscored the efficacy of logistic regression as a statistical methodology in human resource selection and these psychological dimensions as a means of screening pilot candidates for program assignment. The demand among commercial air carriers and corporate aviation for greater consistency and validity of aircrew resource selection methods grows continuously. In the past, the emphasis has been on evaluating technical qualifications and operational experience. There has been no shortage of applicants meeting the basic standard in these areas. The challenge today and in the future is to go beyond that stage of evaluation to develop more effective means of measuring the social aspects of the human variable in the aviation safety equation. Selection protocols are under close, continuous scrutiny and now include personality and temperament characteristics related to crew coordination and team assimilation (Chidester, 1991). Research suggested that in the past selection protocols have suffered in predictive validity with content remaining basically unchanged (Damos, 1995). These protocols in the past have indicated higher predictive validity in the training program, not in the operational environment (Damos, 1996).

In a manoeuvering aircraft, visual information is often a crucial factor in the pilot's ability to judge the aircraft's altitude and position with respect to external and terrain features. A body of research evidence supports the following conceptual framework. (1) The human visual system processes a limited number of visual dimensions almost independently of each other (for example, colour, luminance, spatial frequency, orientation, changing size, motion in depth, time to contact). (2) Each of these selective sensitivities shows considerable intersubject variability. (3) Intersubject variability is far from perfectly correlated across the set of selective sensitivities.

This historical article explores Gemelli’s groundbreaking contributions to understanding spatial cognition, particularly in aviation contexts, decades before contemporary scientific findings. During World War I, Gemelli, a medical officer and pilot, focused on selecting pilots based on their attitudes rather than their physical abilities. His work predated crucial developments in spatial cognition, including concepts of field dependence/independence and environmental representation. Gemelli examined perception through Gestalt psychology, showing that people create mental images of space instead of just recording what they see. Gemelli critically analyzed spatial orientation, distinguishing between ground and aerial navigation and recognizing the complex interaction between internal cognitive characteristics and external environmental factors. He anticipated modern research on spatial representation, emphasizing the dynamic nature of spatial perception and individual differences in cognitive processing.

It was found that: 1) increasing vehicle approach velocity yielded a very small (but significant) effect of faster detection of vehicle movement, nevertheless, response variability was relatively large; 2) including the fixed reticle in the FOV produced significantly slower detection at the largest range and the magnitude of the effect was only about 15% of the one sigma value; and 3) increasing background star velocity during this judgment led to slower detection of vehicle movement. While statistically significant, this effect was small and occurred primarily at the largest range. A possible explanation for the last two findings is that other static and dynamic objects within the visual field may compete for available attention which otherwise would be available for judging image expansion; thus, the target's retinal image has to expand more than otherwise for its movement to be detected.

Unfortunately, little is known about how effective this simulation training is in regard to cognitive and physiological responses. Methods: Ten qualified pilots completed six flight simulations while real-time eye tracking and physiological data were collected.

A deterioration in psychomotor performance of a helicopter pilot may be detrimental to operational safety. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that psychomotor performance deteriorates over time during sustained operations and that the effect is more pronounced in the feet than the hands. The subjects were helicopter pilots conducting sustained multicrew offshore flight operations in a demanding environment. The remote flight operations involved constant workload in hot environmental conditions with complex operational tasking. METHODS: Over a period of 6 d 10 helicopter pilots were tested. At the completion of daily flying duties, a helicopter-specific screen-based compensatory tracking task measuring tracking accuracy (over a 5-min period) tested both hands and feet. Data were compared over time and tested for statistical significance for both deterioration and differential effect. RESULTS: A statistically significant deterioration of psychomotor performance was evident in the pilots over time for both hands and feet. There was also a statistically significant differential effect between the hands and the feet in terms of tracking accuracy. The hands recorded a 22.6% decrease in tracking accuracy, while the feet recorded a 39.9% decrease in tracking accuracy. DISCUSSION: The differential effect may be due to prioritization of limb movement by the motor cortex due to factors such as workload-induced cognitive fatigue. This may result in a greater reduction in performance in the feet than the hands, posing a significant risk to operational safety. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Helicopter simulator performance prediction using the Random Forest method</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Different aspects of the aviation system, such as pilot's fitness, supervision, and working conditions, interact to produce or protect against flight safety hazards.

Background: Non-technical skills encompass the interpersonal and cognitive skills necessary for safe and efficient team performance in high-risk environments. There is a lack of research investigating non-technical skill use during helicopter flight or assessing differences in skills according to mission parameters. Method: The current study comprised 28 semi-structured qualitative interviews based upon the critical incident technique (16 offshore transport pilots, 12 search and rescue pilots). Interviews were thematically coded to identify, and compare, non-technical skills. Results: All key non-technical skills were reported across both pilot groups. Differences were identified at the element level of skills across the groups (e.g., while both groups reported utilizing situational awareness, elemental sub-components were based upon different attentional factors). A category for cognitive readiness was identified specific to search and rescue—this category encapsulated the elements necessary for a swift, effective response to emergencies. Conclusion: The results indicate helicopter pilots’ non-technical skills vary according to mission parameters, suggesting specific flight goals require different nuances of non-technical skills for mission achievement. We suggest that non-technical skills training should be tailored to the mission focus of helicopter pilots in order to further error mitigation strategies, enrich training relevance, and enhance effectiveness. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Cognitive workload and psychophysiological parameters during multitask activity in helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Helicopter pilots are involved in a complex multitask activity, implying overuse of cognitive resources, which may result in piloting task impairment or in decision-making failure. Studies usually investigate this phenomenon in well-controlled, poorly ecological situations by focusing on the correlation between physiological values and either cognitive workload or emotional state. This study aimed at jointly exploring workload induced by a realistic simulated helicopter flight mission and emotional state, as well as physiological markers. Method: The experiment took place in the helicopter full flight dynamic simulator. Six participants had to fly on two missions. Workload level, skin conductance, RMS-EMG, and emotional state were assessed. Results: Joint analysis of psychological and physiological parameters associated with workload estimation revealed particular dynamics in each of three profiles. 1) Expert pilots showed a slight increase of measured physiological parameters associated with the increase in difficulty level. Workload estimates never reached the highest level and the emotional state for this profile only referred to positive emotions with low emotional intensity. 2) Non-Expert pilots showed increasing physiological values as the perceived workload increased. However, their emotional state referred to either positive or negative emotions, with a greater variability in emotional intensity. 3) Intermediate pilots were similar to Expert pilots regarding emotional states and similar to Non-Expert pilots regarding physiological patterns. Discussion: Overall, high interindividual variability of these results highlight the complex link between physiological and psychological parameters with workload, and question whether physiology alone could predict a pilot's inability to make the right decision at the right time. © 2015.

This study investigates the opportunities and challenges associated with backseating in an aircraft when another student is learning to fly. An ethnographic study of a flight school in Australia was conducted via observation and in-depth interviews. The results show opportunities such as learning from common mistakes, recognizing patterns, and reinforcing struggling areas in a stress-free environment, without any extra costs. The reported concerns included weight limits and regulatory issues, student nervousness when observed, and insufficient time to backseat flights.

This claim is inconsistent with many of the mainstream approaches to education and cognition. I describe what it means to be situated, and I outline the central issues raised in the literature on situated cognition and situated learning. The ideas outlined here have several implications for the conduct of flight instruction. The most pervasive implications are that current and potential training practices in aviation can create a breach between instruction and practice and can lead to the development of inert skills. A recurrent theme for situated cognition is that there is a self-organizing character to learning. If adequately supported by the design of the workspace and the structure of the training program, this self-organizing character of learning will limit the possibility of a breach between instruction and practice and will ensure development of robust skills. A further implication of the research reviewed here is that the role of aviation specialists in the design of systems and training programs has been too limited for it to be fully effective. I introduce the procedure of participatory design as an alternative approach that may ensure the effectiveness of flight training. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The quality of flight instructor training also varies greatly because there is no standardized syllabus for the instructor course. Both flight instructors and inspectors felt that flight instructor training should provide competency in teaching methods and a more thorough understanding of learning and evaluation theories. They also stressed the need for senior instructors who teach the flight instructor course to receive additional training before they are authorized to teach others how to teach because the quality of flight training rests with them. Flight instructors conveyed strong feelings about the methods used by Transport Canada to evaluate their teaching effectiveness. The main objections concerned the use of role playing as a means of assessing the teaching ability of flight instructors and the use of a flight test record to hold flight instructors accountable for the success or failure of their students. By far, the most contentious issue was the flight test record. Because flight instructors are not protected by tenure or a permanent teaching qualification, they saw the evaluation process, based on accountability, not so much as a useful tool for personal improvement, but as an interference or a threat to their livelihood. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Background: Pilot training has remained relatively unchanged for over thirty years. The syllabi for flight training contains little information about specific educational techniques or instructions that may assist the flight instructor in his/her role. Matching the learning style of the student, to that of the teaching style of the educator/instructor has the potential to improve learning outcomes. Method: Eighteen trainee pilots were divided into either visual or auditory learners based on the VARK learning styles model and asked to complete three test flights involving a left-hand circuit using a flight simulator. After each flight, pilots received feedback (control–no feedback, visual, auditory) about a different aspect of their flight performance (actual compared to target). Results: The results revealed when the modality in which the feedback was provided matched the preferred learning style of the pilot, improvements in performance resulted. When there was a mismatch between the two, adverse effects were evident for auditory learners only. Conclusion: From a theoretical perspective, the results provide clear evidence of the link between learning and teaching styles. From an applied perspective, these results highlight the potential benefits of aligning teaching and learning styles in flight training. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

Twenty subjects prone to motion sickness were selected and assigned to one of four groups after pretesting in a Dichgans and Brandt drum to determine their susceptibility to visually-induced apparent motion. They were also pretested with a VDT display of an expanding surface, and on a revolving/tilting chair. Subjects were assigned to one of the four groups by matching their mean tolerance to visually-induced motion. Subjects in the first group served as controls and received only cognitive counseling regarding their ability to tolerate motion environments. Subjects in the other group received the same counseling coupled with incremental exposures to the drum, chair, or VDT, respectively. Posttests on each apparatus revealed that the treatments involving the chair and the drum provided specific increases in tolerance to the device used during treatment, and that the treatment involving the chair provided a generalized tolerance to visually-induced motion. These results support the notion that there are both specific and general components in learning to tolerate motion environments.</abstract>', ""<title>The retention of adaptation to motion sickness eliciting stimulation</title> <abstract>Purpose: This study compared the retention of adaptation to motion sickness eliciting stimulation after 1 mo and 1 yr.

METHODS: Two cohorts of healthy male Chinese subjects received either a single (SSV) or repeated (RSV) sea voyage training program on different vessels. A seasickness incidence (SSI) questionnaire was administered to assess the prevalence of seasickness symptoms (vomiting, nausea, other, or no symptoms). A WLD questionnaire was used to survey the general feeling of WLD (severe, moderate, slight, and none) by a 4-point score as well as the incidence rate (IR) of specific WLD items within 24 h after landing. RESULTS: The RSV cohort had lower overall IR of WLD than the SSV cohort (54.64% vs. 63.78%, N 5 657 for both cohorts). The landing ship trainees in both cohorts showed higher general WLD score and higher IRs of physical fatigue, sleep disorder, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those trained on the small vessels. Subjects with vomiting or nausea had higher general WLD score and higher IRs of concentration distraction, physical fatigue, anorexia, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those with no symptoms. Higher IRs of firing accuracy decline (SSV: 21.35% vs. 7.13%, 9.14%; RSV: 22.11% vs. 9.28%, 5.27%), equipment operation disturbance (SSV: 16.85% vs. 3.57%, 6.85%; RSV: 20.47% vs. 7.85%, 7.03%) were also observed in the vomiting subjects than those with other symptoms and no symptoms.

Because sopite symptoms are often subtle, it is important to assess for their presence, and to distinguish true sopite symptoms from changes in mood and drowsiness that are due to non-motion related factors such as fatigue and boredom. We compared sopite symptoms in the optokinetic drum (OKD) with symptoms in a control condition in which the drum's motion cues were removed. Methods: There were 48 Introductory Psychology students who were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the rotating stripes group (RS) sat inside a drum lined with black and white stripes. The drum rotated at 5 rpm. The control group (Ctrl) sat inside the same drum without stripes or rotation. All participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at pre- and post-drum exposures. Results: The RS, but not the Ctrl, showed increases on all four MSAQ subscales (gastric, peripheral, central, sopite). The groups showed equivalent decreases in positive and negative affect. These findings show that some sopite-related symptoms were due specifically to the motion stimuli, while others could be attributed to non-motion aspects of the experimental situation. Discussion: The findings have implications for the use of control conditions in the study of sopite syndrome, and for methods of assessing the changes in mood and drowsiness that are the cardinal symptoms of sopite.</abstract>""]"

The mediating roles of evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect.</title> <abstract>The present study examined the daily relationship between job performance, relaxation, positive affect, and emotional labor. Drawing on the effort–recovery model and broaden-and-build theory, we proposed that job performance on a particular day fosters evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect and that this leads to increased deep acting and decreased surface acting the next day. To test our propositions, we conducted 2 diary studies using the experienced sampling method. In Study 1, 93 flight attendants participated in morning and end-of-workday surveys for 5 workdays. In Study 2, 98 hotel employees responded to morning, end-of-workday, and evening surveys for 5 workdays. In both studies, we found positive relationships between daily job performance, evening relaxation, next-morning positive affect, and next-day deep acting. We further found support for the indirect effect of daily job performance on next-day deep acting through evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect. Although next-morning positive affect had a marginally negative relationship with next-day surface acting in Study 1, this relationship became nonsignificant when next-morning negative affect was included in the model (Study 2).

The data was collected from airline passengers by utilizing the convenient sampling method. A total of 488 surveys out of 520 participants were included in the analyses conducted using Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) software. The results show that the appearances and attitudes of uniformed cabin crews significantly affect the repurchase intention, and while the brand perception only mediates the effect of attitudes on repurchase intention, the brand imagery both appearances and attitudes of uniformed cabin crews. Results suggest that airlines need to pay attention to both the attitudes and the appearance of the cabin crew to make the passengers feel that the airline is their own extent and, in return, to increase passengers’ repurchase intention. Unlike previous studies, this research focuses on the interplay between visual branding through uniforms and passengers’ psychological mechanisms driving loyalty explained by Social Identity Theory and Aesthetic Labor Theory.

We also analyzed the effect of empathy on variables such as team performance, organizational atmosphere, and instances of irregularity. We analyzed 230 samples obtained from an online questionnaire and convenience sampling of full-service domestic and international carriers in South Korea. A structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that uncommonly attentive behavior, courteous behavior, connecting behavior, and information-sharing behavior showed a positive effect on empathy among colleagues, which in turn positively influenced team performance, organizational atmosphere, and possible irregularities. Moreover, we found that the presence of participants’ closest colleagues within the same team did not moderate the relationship between rapport-building and empathic behavior between airline crew members. Our study has important implications for crew members’ dignity and protection from emotional labor while working in high-pressure environments. Our findings can be used to revise the airline industry’s crew management guidelines and improve the crew’s psychological health and quality of life. © 2021 by the authors.

Although emotional labour can be performed face-to-face (in person) or voice-to-voice (on the telephone), little is known about whether the type of emotional demands and the relationships with strain outcomes differ according to mode of delivery. The purpose of this paper is to research these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Relationships are assessed between three dimensions of emotional labour (emotional display rules, and the faking and suppression of emotions) and strain outcomes (psychological distress, work-life conflict and job satisfaction) in a sample of 124-cabin crew (face-to-face interaction) and 122 telesales agents (voice-to-voice interaction). The emotional labour dimensions that are significant predictors of strain outcomes for both groups are examined by multiple regression. Findings - No significant differences were observed between groups in mean levels of emotional labour variables. A greater proportion of variance in all types of strain was explained by the emotional labour components for participants who interact with customers face-to-face but these differences did not reach statistical significance. The emotional labour dimensions that predicted each strain outcome varied according to mode of delivery. Practical implications - Ways by which service sector organisations might counteract the potentially negative effects of performing emotional labour are discussed. Originality/value - The study provides some initial evidence that the impact of mode of delivery in emotion work is worthy of further investigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.</abstract>']"

The number of aircraft under control per hour was recorded as index of workload. Recordings involved subjective ratings (mood, physical fitness, fatigue) and objective measures (hean rate, vanilJyl mandelic acid excretion, reaction times, critical flicker fusion, oral temperature). In addition, the subjects fined out questionnaires for personality traits (extroversion, neuroticis, anxiety) and behavioural characteristics (momingness, rigidity of sleeping habits, vigourness to overcome drowsiness). The volume of air traffic varied greatly with peaks during the day and low levels at night. Nevertheless, the heart rates of the group members showed quite constant levels in all the three shifts, irrespective of the workload. The same pattern appeared in the controllers' excretion of VMA, which remained high during both day and night shifts, regardless of the reduced workload. The subjective mood and physical fitness decreased similarly, while feelings of fatigue increased on all three shifts, particularly on the night shift. The circadian rhythm of the oral temperature showed a slight modification of the noctural depression during the night shift, caused by the state of awakeness and activity. However, the rhythm was not altered in its normal circadian phase, due to the fast shift rotation adopted.

There were two subjects in a room, they could not be alone and it was difficult for them to have their own personal space and intimacy. In these circumstances, as in outer space, interpersonal relationships were of prime importance. This situation enabled us, through systematic observation, to analyze the evolution of the relational behavior in dyads, and to quote some social indicators of adaptation. Results show significant withdrawal, and the time spent alone was marked by the emergence, during the experiment, of specific preferential activities. Behavioral contagion was observed in each dyad (people engaged in the same activities at the same time), except in the one case of abandon. Moreover, the highest rates of inactivity and withdrawal were noted in this case. Verbal indicators were useful to comment these results and showed that, for all the dyads, one of the two subjects always played a regulating role by expressing a very positive perception of the situation. These results emphasize the importance of psycho-sociological factors in isolation and confinement.

However, psychomotor performance is difficult to assess. A battery of standardized and computerized tests, so-called ""Automated Portable Test System"" (APTS) was devised to ascertain the cognitive, perceptive and motor abilities and their possible fluctuations according to environmental effects. Antiorthostatic bedrest, often used to simulate weightlessness, (particularly cardiovascular modifications) also constitutes a situation of social confinement and isolation. During two bedrest experiments (with head-down tilt of -6°) of 28 days each, we intended to assess psychomotor performance of 6 males so as to determine whether: &#x02022; -on the one hand, it could be altered by remaining in decubitus; &#x02022; -on the other, the Lower Body Negative Pressure sessions, designed to prevent orthostatic intolerance back on Earth, could improve the performance. To accomplish this, part of the APTS tests as well as an automated perceptive attention test were performed. No downgrading of psychomotor performance was observed.

Behavioral health services, similar to those offered to the U.S. astronauts who undertake 6-mo missions onboard the International Space Station, were provided to 13 long-duration head-down bed rest participants. Long-duration missions pose unique challenges and stressors, including separation from primary support group, monotonous environment, and loss of privacy and autonomy. Methods: The psychological services team, consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a master's level psychological support scientist, provided behavioral health services throughout all phases of the Flight Analogs Project (FAP) long-duration head-down bed rest study. During the initial screening phase, potential candidates completed 4 h of psychological testing and a 1.5-h clinical interview with a psychologist to assess their psychological fitness and ability to complete the study successfully. Additionally, the psychological services team provided pre-admission trainings on time management, stress management, and communication skills and conflict resolution. Throughout their stay on the research unit, study participants received regular individual and group visits from the psychological services team. Training was also provided to study personnel to address personality and behavioral management challenges. Results: Psychological support and training provided to both subjects and study personnel have successfully improved the well being of study participants.

METHODS: subjects completed the Balloon analog Risk task (BaRt) and two psychological scales once during the acclimation period, six times during the hDBR period, and twice during the recovery period. During the hDBR period, subjects were required to maintain a −6° head-down position for most daily activities and only permitted to change positions around the longitudinal axis of their bodies. RESULTS: the results demonstrated that subjects’ risk-taking behaviors were significantly affected by bed rest, with an increased propensity to engage in risky activities during the head-down stage. in addition, BaRt scores did not return to baseline when subjects entered the recovery stage. in terms of psychological variables, the results indicated that scores of general self-efficacy and recovery were negatively correlated with BaRt indicators, while stress levels were positively correlated with risky behaviors. compared to other psychological variables, the perceived physical stress, including fatigue, somatic complaints, and sleep quality, exhibited the strongest correlations with BaRt indicators. DISCUSSION: the findings of this study implied that prolonged exposure to a simulated microgravity environment and confined isolation conditions may have a sustained impact on risk-taking tendencies, with changes in risky behaviors in the head-down state more closely associated with physiological symptoms. © © by The Authors.</abstract>', ""<title>Chinese herbal medicine and cognitive and emotional functions during 60-day head-down bed rest</title> <abstract>Introduction: This study aimed to test the efficacy of an oral-intake Chinese herbal medicine in enhancing the cognitive and emotional functions of individuals in a simulated microgravity condition.

Methods: There were 14 healthy male subjects who were randomly assigned to a Chinese medicine (CMG) or a control (CG) group and underwent a 60-d 6° head-down bed-rest protocol. Testing was conducted before (Day -3), throughout (Days 3, 7, 20, 40, 57), and after (Days +3, +10) the bedrest protocol. The Arrow Test, Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), Dual Task, and Affect Grid were administered on all testing days. Results: The CMG demonstrated consistently higher scores on the BART (Days 20 to 40; Mean: CMG, 43.0 to 46.2 and CG, 30.2 to 25.5) and lower levels of arousal on the Affect Grid (Days 7 to 40; Mean: CMG, 6.9 to 6.7 and CG, 8.1 to 8.0) than did the CG. The CMG showed significantly higher performance on the Arrow Test (incompatible condition) at the beginning of the bed-rest period (Day 3 to 7; Mean: 799.5 ms and 763.1 ms, respectively) which was not observed in the CG. Discussions: Results suggest that the Chinese herbal medicine may calm subjects' emotions by lowering the arousal level.

Low probability of need satisfaction leads to negative emotions, actively minimized by the subject. Increased probability of satisfaction, as compared to earlier forecast, generates positive emotions, which the subject tries to maximize, i.e. to enhance, to prolong, to repeat. The informational theory of emotions encompasses their reflective function, the laws of their appearance, the regulatory significance of emotions, and their role in organization of behavior. The level of emotional stress influences the operator's performance. A decrease in the emotional tonus leads to drowsiness, lack of vigilance, missing of significant signals and to slower reactions. An extremely high stress level disorganizes the activity, complicates it with a trend toward incorrect actions and reactions to insignificant signals (false alarms).

This might be an effective self-defense mechanism against mental overload caused by situations such as increased time on task, extremely fast speakers, unintelligible speakers, and long working hours. It seems to occur rather automatically, without being noticed by the performing interpreter.

In order to better understand the effect of stress on cognitive performance, and whether this effect is related to an autonomic response to stress, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used as a testing platform along with a 2-Choice Reaction Time Task. When considering the nature and importance of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) work and the fact that they are subjected to high levels of stress, this study was conducted with a sample of ATCs (n = 11). Linear Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features were extracted from ATCs electrocardiogram (ECG) acquired using a medical-grade wearable ECG device (Vital Jacket® (1-Lead, Biodevices S.A, Matosinhos, Portugal)). Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were also used to measure perceived stress. TSST produced statistically significant changes in some HRV parameters (Average of normal-to-normal intervals (AVNN), Standard Deviation of all NN (SDNN), root mean square of differences between successive rhythm-to-rhythm (RR) intervals (RMSSD), pNN20, and LF/HF) and subjective measures of stress, which recovered after the stress task. Although these short-term changes in HRV showed a tendency to normalize, an impairment on cognitive performance was evident. Despite that participant’s reaction times were lower, the accuracy significantly decreased, presenting more errors after performing the acute stress event. Results can also point to the importance of the development of quantified occupational health (qOHealth) devices to allow for the monitoring of stress responses. © 2018 by the authors.

Based on a comprehensive approach to the problem of stress, we have decided to evaluate all components of a stress response – immunological (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, CRP, TNF-alpha) and hormonal one (CRH, ACTH), as well as to evaluate the psychological indicators of stress, coping with stress, and controlling emotional reactions as psychological markers that predispose to the most beneficial adaption in relation to stressors affecting flight personnel taking part in peace missions abroad. Material and method. The research studies being the subject matter of the project were conducted among 113 antiterrorists and 123 representatives of aircrew (236 respondents in total) who participated in peace missions outside Poland. The study was conducted both before departure and during the missions. The study included a biochemical evaluation (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, CRP, TNF-alpha, CRH, ACTH) as well as a psychological assessment based on the Perceived Stress Scale by S. Cohen (PSS-10) and the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS) by M. Watson and S. Greer, and the COPE Inventory by J. Carver. Results. Based on a statistical analysis of the variables, a relationship between the level of perceived stress and the methods of coping with it as well as between the selected methods of emotion control and inflammatory response indicators, was found. Conclusions. In difficult situations, accompanied by an increase in the variables responsible for the biochemical inflammatory response of an organism, the effective model of coping with difficult situations and emotion control increases, while the subjective level of perceived stress drops. © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association.

It is particularly true in complex working environments (e.g. flight deck, air traffic control tower), where individuals have sometimes to cope with a high mental workload and stressful situations. Several models (i.e. processing efficiency theory, cognitive-energetical framework) have attempted to provide a conceptual basis on how human performance is modulated by high workload and stress/anxiety. These models predict that stress can reduce human cognitive efficiency, even in the absence of a visible impact on the task performance. Performance may be protected under stress thanks to compensatory effort, but only at the expense of a cognitive cost. Yet, the psychophysiological cost of this regulation remains unclear. We designed two experiments involving pupil diameter, cardiovascular and prefrontal oxygenation measurements. Participants performed the Toulouse N-back Task that intensively engaged both working memory and mental calculation processes under the threat (or not) of unpredictable aversive sounds. The results revealed that higher task difficulty (higher n level) degraded the performance and induced an increased tonic pupil diameter, heart rate and activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, and a decreased phasic pupil response and heart rate variability. Importantly, the condition of stress did not impact the performance, but at the expense of a psychophysiological cost as demonstrated by lower phasic pupil response, and greater heart rate and prefrontal activity. Prefrontal cortex seems to be a central region for mitigating the influence of stress because it subserves crucial functions (e.g. inhibition, working memory) that can promote the engagement of coping strategies. Overall, findings confirmed the psychophysiological cost of both mental effort and stress. Stress likely triggered increased motivation and the recruitment of additional cognitive resources that minimize its aversive effects on task performance (effectiveness), but these compensatory efforts consumed resources that caused a loss of cognitive efficiency (ratio between performance effectiveness and mental effort). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>']"

METHODS: T he study performed a path analysis on survey data from 106 Chinese civil aviation pilots to explore the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and job burnout. RESULTS: T he findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal affects job burnout through perceived stress and psychological resilience while expressive suppression impacts it via perceived stress.

Background: Adversity in the workplace causes occupational stress, influencing resiliency, and reducing job performance and wellness. This can lead to burnout and attrition. Female pilots in male-dominated work environments experience adversity, resulting in occupational stress. Resilience may be a mitigating factor for coping with occupational stress. Women in male-dominated professions remain the extreme minority. Further, a severe pilot shortage magnifies the need to recruit and retain pilots from underrepresented groups. Method: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to validate the use of the CD-RISC for measuring resilience in female pilots. Inter- and intra-group resilience score comparisons of the 1,302 female pilots were analyzed. Results: An abridged version of the CD-RISC was found applicable to measuring resilience in female pilots. Age and work experience of the female pilots imply that they may influence higher resilience. A significantly lower resilience score was found in the sample in comparison to a national sample average resilience score. Conclusion: Female pilots’ resilience is likely influenced by workplace adversity, which may lead to increased occupation stress, greater attrition, and fewer pilot entrants. Interventions aimed at increasing the resiliency of female pilots are critical to solving the pilot shortage. The findings provide insight into the recruitment, retention, and development of women in male-dominated occupations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Rumination and psychological resilience in Chinese civil aviation flight students: the chain mediating role of proactive coping and generalized anxiety disorder</title> <abstract>Background: As the focus of aviation safety shifts from technology to human factors, the central role of psychological resilience in flight safety has become increasingly prominent. However, the internal mechanism of how rumination affects psychological resilience, particularly the chain mediating effect of proactive coping and generalized anxiety, has not been thoroughly explored in high-stress populations. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, 1,235 flight students from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China were surveyed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to gather data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and the Bootstrap method were used to test the chain mediating effect. Results: Rumination exhibited a significant negative correlation with psychological resilience (r\u202f=\u202f−0.365, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and proactive coping (r\u202f=\u202f−0.285, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), and a positive correlation with generalized anxiety (r\u202f=\u202f0.337, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Psychological resilience showed a positive correlation with proactive coping (r\u202f=\u202f0.727, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and a negative correlation with generalized anxiety (r\u202f=\u202f−0.270, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Mediation effect analysis revealed that proactive coping and generalized anxiety each played a partial mediating role between rumination and psychological resilience. The mediating effect comprised three paths: “rumination → proactive coping → psychological resilience,” “rumination → generalized anxiety → psychological resilience,” and “rumination → proactive coping → generalized anxiety → psychological resilience,” with effect sizes of 91.22, 7.80, and 0.98%, respectively. Conclusion: Rumination in civil aviation flight students not only directly impairs psychological resilience but also indirectly influences it through the chain mechanism of inhibiting proactive coping and intensifying generalized anxiety. Consequently, it is recommended that civil aviation psychological training focus on cognitive-behavioral interventions to interrupt the activation of rumination, foster adaptive coping strategies, and construct a psychological resilience development model tailored to the specific demands of the aviation profession. © © 2025 Liao, Wang, Liu and Hu.</abstract>', ""<title>Exploring the measurement of psychological resilience in Chinese civil aviation pilots based on generalizability theory and item response theory</title> <abstract>Understanding and accurately measuring resilience among Chinese civil aviation pilots is imperative, especially concerning the psychological impact of distressing events on their well-being and aviation safety. Despite the necessity, a validated and tailored measurement tool specific to this demographic is absent. Addressing this gap, this study built on the widely used CD-RISC-25 to analyze and modify its applicability to Chinese civil aviation pilots. Utilizing CD-RISC-25 survey data from 231 Chinese pilots, correlational and differential analyses identified items 3 and 20 as incongruent with this population's resilience profile. Subsequently, factor analysis derived a distinct two-factor resilience psychological framework labeled “Decisiveness” and “Adaptability”, which diverged from the structure found in American female pilots and the broader Chinese populace. Additionally, to further accurately identify the measurement characteristics of this 2-factor measurement model, this study introduced Generalized Theory and Item Response Theory, two modern measurement analysis theories, to comprehensively analyze the overall reliability of the measurement and issues with individual items. Results showed that the 2-factor model exhibited high reliability, with generalizability coefficient reaching 0.89503 and dependability coefficient reaching 0.88496, indicating the 2-factor measurement questionnaire can be effectively utilized for relative and absolute comparison of Chinese civil aviation pilot resilience. However, items in Factor 2 provided less information and have larger room for optimization than those in Factor 1, implying item option redesign may be beneficial. Consequently, this study culminates in the creation of a more accurate and reliable two-factor psychological resilience measurement tool tailored for Chinese civil aviation pilots, while exploring directions for optimization. By facilitating early identification of individuals with lower resilience and enabling the evaluation of intervention efficacy, this tool aims to positively impact pilot psychological health and aviation safety in the context of grief and trauma following distressing events. © 2024, The Author(s).</abstract>"", '<title>The Moderating Role of Resilience in the Relationship Between Occupational Stressors and Psychological Distress Among Aviation Pilots in Pakistan</title> <abstract>Background: Aviation is one of the most demanding professions, exposing pilots to persistent stressors such as fatigue, irregular schedules, and high safety responsibility. These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots. Method: A sample of 200 pilots completed validated self-report measures: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro. Results: Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = −0.46, p < 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p < 0.01. Conclusions: Resilience emerged as both a direct and indirect buffer against psychological strain in aviation. These findings underscore the importance of promoting adaptive coping and resilience training, alongside effective fatigue management, to enhance pilot well-being and maintain safety in aviation systems. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>']"

While prior studies have focused on the Big Five and HEXACO models in ethical decision-making, empirical applications of the Eysenck framework to honesty prediction remain scarce-particularly in aviation, where dishonest acts (e.g., underreporting safety incidents) carry severe public safety consequences. Methods: We collected behavioral data from 102 flight and air traffic control cadets using a coin-toss task. Explainable machine learning (XGBoost) was employed to model nonlinear relationships between personality, gender, and honesty. Model performance was evaluated via AUC, with SHAP analysis identifying key predictors. Results: XGBoost achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.802). SHAP analysis revealed: (1) neuroticism as the strongest predictor of dishonesty; (2) significant gender differences (higher dishonesty rates in males); and (3) threshold effects for Psychoticism and Extraversion. Discussion: This work makes three key contributions: (1) first systematic application of the Eysenck model to aviation honesty prediction; (2) identification of gender as a critical moderating variable; and (3) development of a SHAP-driven interpretable framework that connects machine learning outputs with psychological theory. Practically, these findings enable data-driven screening of cadets' honesty tendencies during recruitment, facilitating targeted interventions for safer aviation operations. © © 2025 Meng, Peng, Zhang, Chen, Huang, Chen and Zhao.</abstract>""]"

Crews also had strongly differing perceptions of employer views on self-grounding, depending upon employment setting. Conclusions: There were sizable disparities between aircrew fl ying for U.S. regional, European mainline, and large corporate aviation departments with respect to self-grounding when ill and routinely receiving a seasonal infl uenza vaccination.

The oxygen mask model - which takes its name from flight attendants' directives to parents to put on their own oxygen mask before putting on their child's - says that parents should consider their own interests only insofar as doing so is, ultimately, good for the sick child. The wide interests model suggests that in doing well by my child I am at the very same time doing well by myself. My interests can, and plausibly do, encompass the interests of others; they are, to that extent, wide. There is, then, no sharp separation between the interests of the sick child and the interests of other family members. In the family interests model, families themselves are seen as having interests that are neither identical to the sum, nor a simple function, of the interests of individual family members. The family has goals, values, and aspirations that are essentially corporate rather than individual. According to this model, these family interests can explain why sacrifices can sometimes be demanded of some family members for the sake of others in a medical setting. Finally, the direct model takes a simpler view of family members' interests; it claims that these interests matter simply on their own and should be taken into account in making treatment decisions for a sick child. This model openly considers the competing interests that parents and other family members often have when caring for a sick child, and advocates for weighing those interests when making decisions for and about the sick child. While there is room for all four models at the bedside, I argue that the direct model should be highlighted in clinical decision-making. © © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</abstract>""]"

In this study we investigated if these two measures of workload were generalisable to controllers (ATCs) working in radar facilities serving major airports. 3,110 observations were made on radar sectors at the 13 major radar control rooms in the U.S.A. A large number of air traffic variables and communication tasks were measured. Behavioural ratings were made by expert-observer ATC's. The results replicated previous findings that peak traffic and the duration of radio-communications functioned as behavioural stressors. Time monitoring and stand-by time also were found to predict behavioural responses. Careful consideration of these and other results led to the conclusion that peak traffic is the most generalisable environmental stressor for ATC's behaviour whereas the other workload measures are more correctly viewed as concomitants of the demand characteristics of ATC work. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"", ""<title>The taskload-effciency-safety-buffer triangle - development and validation with air traffic management</title> <abstract>The Taskload-Efficiency-Safety-Buffer Triangle (TEST) was developed as a new computerised scaling tool for quickly visualising changes in and trade-offs between the three critical factors that determine the work situation of air traffic management (ATM), i.e. taskload, efficiency and safety-buffers. Based on a task analysis of ATM and backed up by the stress-strain model, an easy-to-interpret triangle was constructed and validated both in simulated and real ATM workplaces. Results from the validation studies show that TEST does not only reflect the most relevant task characteristics, but also provides additional insights in the controllers' working styles. The TEST tool can make ATM safety surveys more efficient and help supervisors to decide about optimal times for opening or closing additional sectors. Statement of Relevance: TEST is a new tool to assess taskload, efficiency and safety-buffers in a joint scaling. It reflects increases in taskload and effects of taskload on safety-buffers and efficiency, as well as trade-offs in opposite directions.

Expert observers rated the degree of activity and behavioural arousal of ATCs working the 47 radar sectors at the same time the objective measures were made. These ‘pace’ ratings were signficantly related to peak traffic count and duration of radio-communications. The control load factors were not related to behavioural responses. Statistical analyses indicated several refinements for the definition and measurement of the control load factors. For example, airspace control load was reliably estimated by sector type and number of transitioning planes, while co-ordination control load was most appropriately estimated by duration of radio-communications ' These results suggested that estimations of workload may be made by a relatively few objective measures, and that at least one estimate of individual’s behavioural responses, i.e. pace ratings, can be predicted by peak traffic counts. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"", '<title>Mental Workload in Air Traffic Control: An Index Constructed from Field Tests</title> <abstract>Background: Mental workload assessment is a recurrent issue in air traffic control (ATC). Studies of ATC have used either objective aspects, i.e., numbers and distribution of aircraft, or subjective factors, such as self-imposed performance and stress levels, with mixed results. This is partly due to the difficulty in bringing together comparable data pertaining to both air traffic, with its ever-changing distribution, and judgement or quickly fluctuating psychophysiological variables. Methods: We propose a method of mental load estimation devised to take into account both objective traffic variables and the additional load imposed by subjective effects, including the seriousness of conflicts and the time-pressure for their resolution. First, we developed a traffic load index (TLI) to identify time boundaries during which additional load may occur. Then we quantified the additional load according to the air traffic situation. Results: TLI was developed from analysis of 25 h of recordings of radar control sessions involving 25 professional air traffic controllers at a major airport. Results were then compared with a simple objective index (number of aircraft) and subjective workload ratings (NASA-TLX test). The whole population (intersubjects analysis) showed a better correlation between the TLI and the self-rated workload than for the number of aircraft alone. Among the controllers who rated more than one level of workload through the TLX-test, 77.8% showed better correlation between TLI and TLX than between N and TLX (intrasubjects analysis).

Background: In affective experience studies, people’s evaluation of a period of experience is strongly influenced by the most intense (peak) point and the endpoint. However, whether the effects exist in mental workload evaluations made by professional operators is still not known. Method: In Study 1, 20 ATCos performed air traffic control scenarios on high-fidelity radar simulators and reported their mental workload. We used a 2 (high peak, low peak) × 2 (high end, low end) within-subject design. In Study 2, another group of 43 ATCos completed a survey asking them to predict their mental workload given the same air traffic control scenarios. Results: In Study 1, ATCos reported higher mental workload after completing the high-peak and the high-end scenarios. In contrast, in Study 2, ATCos predicted the peak workload effect but not the end workload effect when asked to predict their experience in dealing with the same scenarios. Conclusion: Peak and end effects exist in subjective mental workload evaluation, but experts only had meta-cognitive awareness of the peak effect, and not the end effect. Application: Researchers and practitioners that use subjective workload estimates for work design decisions need to be aware of the potential impact of peak and end task demand effects on subjective mental workload ratings provided by expert operators. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>']"

Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers' urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively. Three candidate biomarkers were selected on the basis of statistical significance, coefficient of variance, and compared with data of the three groups.

Background: Air medical professionals face unique challenges above and beyond the difficulty of working in a hospital setting or prehospital ground medicine. Providers frequently work multiple 24-hour shifts, resulting in circadian rhythm disturbance and cumulative sleep loss. The plane environment and the effects of flight are also contributory to fatigue; however, air medics must engage in emergent, time-sensitive, life-saving procedures despite these challenging circumstances. Although the aeromedical industry has rapidly expanded in the past several decades, the field of flight medicine lacks validated tools to evaluate fatigue levels, and many companies rely on flight providers’ recognition of fatigue to prevent work-related mistakes. Method: To establish construct validity, scores on the FRA were compared to scores on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), an objective measure of fatigue. Results: The results indicate that a total of five questions on the FRA was significantly and strongly correlated with mean reaction time on the PVT (r =.60, p =.001). Perceived fitness for duty was poorly correlated with fatigue levels as measured by the FRA (r <.01) suggesting medics may have difficulty recognizing when they are fatigued and fit for duty. Conclusion: The air medical industry is rapidly expanding, and valid and reliable measures are indicated to assess fatigue levels among providers. Initial findings suggest the FRA is an efficient tool to objectively measure the fatigue levels of air medics through a self-report measure. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Assessing air medical crew real-time readiness to perform critical tasks</title> <abstract>Background. Air medical transport has had problems with its safety record, attributed in part to human error. Flight crew members (FCMs) must be able to focus on critical safety tasks in the context of a stressful environment. Flight crew members'™ cognitive readiness (CR) to perform their jobs may be affected by sleep deprivation, personal problems, high workload, and use of alcohol and drugs. Objective. The current study investigated the feasibility of using a computer-based cognitive task to assess FCMs'™ readiness to perform their job. Methods. The FCMs completed a short questionnaire to evaluate their physiologic and psychological state at the beginning and end of each shift. The FCMs then performed 3 minutes of a computer-based cognitive task called synthetic work environment (SYNWIN test battery). Task performance was compared with the questionnaire variables using correlation and regression analysis. Differences between the beginning and end of each shift were matched and compared using a paired Students t test. Results. SYNWIN performance was significantly worse at the end of a shift compared with the beginning of the shift (p = 0.028) primarily because of decrement in the memory component. The SYNWIN composite scores were negatively correlated to degree of irritability felt by the participant, both before (r = -0.25) and after (r = -0.34) a shift and were significantly correlated with amount of sleep (0.22), rest (0.30), and life satisfaction (0.30). Conclusions. Performance by FCMs on a simple, rapid, computer-based psychological test correlates well with self-reported sleep, rest, life satisfaction, and irritability. Although further studies are warranted, these findings suggest that assessment of the performance of FCMs on a simple, rapid, computer-based, multitasking battery is feasible as an approach to determine their readiness to perform critical safety tasks through the SYNWIN task battery. © 2011 National Association of EMS Physicians.</abstract>"", '<title>Detecting fatigue in car drivers and aircraft pilots by using non-invasive measures: The value of differentiation of sleepiness and mental fatigue</title> <abstract>Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most crucial factors that contribute to a decrease of the operating performance of aircraft pilots and car drivers and, as such, plays a dangerous role in transport safety. To reduce fatigue-related tragedies and to increase the quality of a healthy life, many studies have focused on exploring effective methods and psychophysiological indicators for detecting and monitoring fatigue. However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and field studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, fitness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufficient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters. © 2020 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd</abstract>']"

In Norway, the Aeromedical Section of the Civil Aviation Authority assesses whether pilots are medically fit to fly. This study presents the reasons for medical disqualification among the Norwegian commercial pilot population during a 20-yr period. Methods: Files on all disqualified commercial pilots were reviewed and subdivided into age groups and diagnostic categories. Different disqualification rates were calculated. Results: From the study population of 48,229 pilot-years, 275 pilots were permanently grounded, which gives a 20-yr average disqualification rate of 5.7 per 1,000 pilot-years. Discussion and Conclusions: For cardiovascular diseases the disqualification rate was lower after 1997 than before, which is explained by improved treatment and more lenient requirements. In the diagnostic categories, neurology, musculoskeletal, and psychiatric diseases, the disqualification rate increased after 1997. This fact is probably not attributed to more stringent health requirements, but possibly to the attitudes of the pilots, who have become more critical with respect to their subjective perception of their working environment and psychosocial factors.</abstract>', '<title>Grounding of Pilots: Medical Reasons and Recommendations for Prevention</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: this article presents the results of an EASA-commissioned study aimed at analyzing the medical causes of grounding of a broad European pilot population and recommending measures to reduce the risk of in-flight incapacitation in commercial air transport pilots. method: European National Aviation Authorities (NAAs) were requested to provide data concerning the total number of pilots that were examined, their age and license category, number of unfit pilots, and the medical causes of each case of grounding.

Of these cases, 2.1% were assessed as unfit to fly. Frequent causes for grounding a pilot were cardiovascular (19%), psychiatric (11%), neurological (10%), and psychological (9%). Cardiovascular conditions were the most frequent cause for grounding in the older age groups, with 21% in the age 51-60 cohort, 28% in the age 61-65 cohort, and 48% in those beyond 65 yr. Psychiatric and psychological diagnoses were most frequent in the age 20-40 cohort. discussion: Cardiovascular conditions were the most frequent cause for grounding.

The majority (45) of these were unsuitable for psychological reasons. Medical disability accounted for approximately 20% of the pilots separated from the company during the period of study. Age-specific disability rates increased rapidly after age 45 years, with cardiovascular disease responsible for more than 50% of these medical losses.

The putative mechanism for this increase in safety is that previously demonstrated improvements in lateral and vertical control of the aircraft in flight should carry over to the landing situation. Alternatively, it is possible that, during approach and landing, the HUD might affect the pilot's ability to assimilate outside cues at the decision height, thereby reducing the success ratio for landings using an HUD. This article reports a pair of experiments that test these competing hypotheses. Taking advantage of the opportunity when an air transport operator introduced HUD in an existing aircraft fleet, we were able to use a Boeing 737-700 full-motion simulator flown by commercial airline pilots. We explored the effects of (a) HUD use, (b) ambient visibility, and (c) length of approach lighting on the size and location of the touchdown footprint. We also explored the effects of HUD use on approach success ratio. HUD use reduced the width of the touchdown footprint in all tested visibility and lighting conditions, including visibility below the minimum allowed. HUD use had no effect on the length of the touchdown footprint. We could not detect any decrease in approach success rate for HUD approaches. Based on these empirical data, the minimum visibility for approaches using HUDs could be set lower than for approaches without an HUD.

Several tunnel-in-the-sky and pathway-in-the-sky concepts including scene-linking elements have been evaluated. Pathway-in-the-sky displays enable pilots to accurately fly difficult trajectories. However, these displays may drive pilots' attention to the aircraft guidance task at the expense of other tasks, particularly when the pathway display is located head-down. A pathway head-up display (HUD) might be a viable solution to overcome this disadvantage. Moreover, the pathway might mitigate the perceptual segregation between the static near domain and the dynamic far domain and hence might improve attention switching between both sources. To more comprehensively overcome the perceptual near-to-far domain disconnect, alphanumeric symbols could be attached to the pathway leading to an HUD design concept called scene linking. A scene-linked pathway-predictor concept was implemented on a monocular retinal scanning head-mounted device (HMD) in combination with an optical head tracker. The evaluation comprises low-fidelity part-task simulations, high-fidelity simulator runs, and flight trials. Where laboratory experiments found evidence in favor of scene-linked pathway HUDs or HMDs, the real flight tests could not fully support this display concept.

Results: Application of the procedure in the test scenarios was high (90.0% full, 100.0% partly), and pilots evaluated the procedure positively (median: 4 on a 1–5 point scale). There was significantly superior decision-making in the experimental group, but immediate responses were significantly less optimal. Pilots sometimes applied the procedure at inappropriate moments. Conclusion: The results of the tested mnemonic-type procedure were promising. The procedure may benefit, however, from modifications to reduce complexity and to stimulate application at the appropriate moment. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this case, we wanted to discuss the response after the rTMS protocol, which we applied to our patient who had startle reactions that severely impair functionality and who did not meet the post traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) criteria or have a major brain lesion after a traffic accident. A 30-year-old single female patient who works as a stewardess in an airline company with no known history of physical or psychological illness but lost consciousness for about three hours after an in-vehicle traffic accident a week ago was admitted to our clinic. The patient had a history of having difficulty in doing her daily work due to the splashing movements that started in her body. No major brain lesion was detected in imaging studies. She did not meet the criteria for PTSD and her EEG results were normal. Medication did not help with the symptoms, so, rTMS was planned. After 6 sessions of rTMS, her movements had stopped completely. Our patient, who did not fully meet the criteria for PTSD and whose imaging and EEG results did not reveal any pathological findings had developed severe onset startle reactions after an in-vehicle traffic accident, fully responded to rTMS treatment and improved her functionality quickly and effectively. Thus, we think that rTMS should be investigated as an effective treatment method in such patients. © 2022 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.</abstract>', '<title>The Influence of Surprise on Upset Recovery Performance in Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to test if performance of airline pilots, in performing an aerodynamic stall recovery procedure, decreases when they are surprised, compared to when they anticipate a stall event. Background: New flight-safety regulations for commercial aviation recommend the introduction of surprise and startle in upset prevention and recovery training. This calls for more evidence on the effects of surprise on pilot performance, as well as methods to effectively induce surprise in training simulators. Method: The study took place in a motion-base simulator with a poststall aerodynamic model. Using a within-subjects design, the recovery performance of 20 pilots was tested in 2 conditions: 1 anticipated condition, and 1 surprise condition. In addition to flight parameters, subjective and physiological data relating to surprise and startle were measured. Results: Pilots had significantly more difficulties with adhering to the recovery procedure in the surprise condition compared to the anticipation condition. The subjective and physiological measures confirmed that the manipulation mainly increased surprise, and to a lesser extent also startle. Conclusion: The results suggest that pilots have more difficulty in managing an upset situation (i.e., an aerodynamic stall) when this situation is presented unexpectedly, underlining that upset prevention and recovery training should include elements of surprise. ©, © The Authors.

Anecdotal reports have indicated Dexedrine (Dex) is effective in ""real world"" sustained operations, and controlled laboratory tests have yielded positive results as well. The aim of this study was to substantiate the efficacy of Dex for sustaining the alertness and performance of pilots during periods of sleep deprivation by showing the robust effects of the medication and its consistent effects across several research efforts. Methods: In the present report, selected data from several controlled aviation studies were reviewed and combined to corroborate the efficacy of Dex as a fatigue countermeasure. Results: The results showed Dex to be effective for maintaining flight skills, psychological mood, and physiological activation (measured via electroencephalograph data) in sleep-deprived pilots. The positive benefits of the medication were not offset by marked disruptions in recovery sleep, although some negative effects were observed (sleep was lighter for several hours following drug administration). Conclusions: Dex is a viable remedy for fatigue in aviation sustained operations. However, Dex is not a substitute for proper crew-rest scheduling because there is no replacement for adequate restful sleep.</abstract>', ""<title>Triazolam impairs learning and fails to improve sleep in a long-range aerial deployment</title> <abstract>Of the soldiers deployed from the 18th Airborne Corps, Ft.

Sleep and activity were measured during the flight by means of a wrist-worn activity monitor. Cognitive performance, mood, and sleepiness were measured 8 h after drug administration during a refueling stop in Europe. Triazolam did not increase the duration or improve the continuity of sleep during the 8-h flight from the U.S. to the refueling point. The scheduling of an inflight meal contributed to this lack of effect. There were no differences in mood or sleepiness between the two groups as assessed by the Profile of Mood States and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Ability to recall verbal material presented immediately prior to testing was impaired by triazolam 8 h after ingestion, as evidenced by fewer items recalled on the Logical Memory portion of the Wechsler Memory Scale. These results suggest that triazolam at a dose of 0.5 mg is unsuitable for use in long-range aerial deployments when unimpaired cognitive functioning is required immediately upon arrival.</abstract>"", '<title>Methamphetamine effects on cognitive processing during extended wakefulness</title> <abstract>We examined the effects of both 5- and 10-mg/70 kg body weight of d-methamphetamine HCl on high event rate vigilance and tracking performance in a 13.5-hr sustained-performance session during one night of sleep loss. At 0116 hours, participants were administered either a 5 mg/70 kg oral dose of d-methamphetamine (n = 10), 10 mg/70 kg d-methamphetamine (n = 10), or a placebo (n = 10) using standard double-blind procedures.

No evidence that amphetamine treatment increased impulsive responding (fast guesses) was observed. The magnitude of the performance effects of the methamphetamine treatments was similar at 3 hr postadministration. However, the effects of the 5-mg dose were shorter-lived, disappearing by the last testing session (6.5 hr postadministration), whereas effects of the 10-mg dose tended to remain throughout testing.

Background: High levels of cognitive performance in pilots is required for flight safety. Methods: Students at a military flight school in Thailand were invited to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria was positive screening for caffeine use disorder. We examined three cognitive functions required for flight performance: (1) vigilance (Mackworth Clock Test), (2) situational awareness, including memory (Corsi block-tapping test) and spatial reasoning (mental rotation test), and (3) reaction time (Deary-Liewald task). Neuropsychological tasks were performed before and 30\xa0minutes after drinking a bottle of 220\xa0ml coffee containing 143 mg of caffeine. Sleep quality was measured by the Thai-Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Twenty-nine healthy males without caffeine use disorder with a mean age of 25.1\xa0years were enrolled. After low-dose caffeine intake (<3 mg/kg body weight), cognitive performance improved significantly in vigilance, situation awareness, and reaction time. Baseline cognitive performance was not different between high (HSQ) and low sleep quality (LSQ) groups. After drinking coffee, however, participants with HSQ demonstrated improvements in vigilance and reaction time, while the LSQ group had improved vigilance only. Conclusion: Low dose caffeine improved vigilance, situational awareness, and reaction time which were cognitive functions required for flight performance.

Strategies to overcome the debilitating effects of sleep deprivation include the ingestion of caffeine. Unknown is the efficacy of caffeine use on specific elements of target detection and marksmanship following a modest period of sustained wakefulness. Methods: There were 20 subjects (mean ± SD of 26.7 ± 7.2 yr of age, 179 ± 6 cm in height, and 84.5 ± 10.8 kg in weight) who participated in double-blind caffeine and placebo trials where each trial involved a 24-h control period (with sleep) followed by 22 h of mixed mental and physical activity with no sleep. At the end of this period, subjects engaged in a 1-h rifle-shooting task. Subjects ingested 400, 100, and 100 mg of caffeine or placebo at 7.5, 3, and 0 h, respectively, prior to shooting. Measures of shooting performance included target engagement time (between target appearance and firing), friend-foe discrimination, accuracy, and precision. Results: Most measures of performance were degraded in the placebo sleep-deprived condition, but only the target engagement time and the number of shots fired were restored by caffeine ingestion. Conclusions: These findings concur with other research involving different periods of sleep deprivation, and indicate that the cognitive component of the shooting task (i.e., target detection) can benefit from caffeine whereas the psychomotor component (marksmanship) does not. It appears that once the target is detected, the subject is sufficiently aroused to engage the target regardless of the subject's level of alertness prior to detection.</abstract>""]"

However, studies have not discussed aircrew experiences related to ejection or how they would like to advise other aircrew to successfully handle ejection as an event. Such information can assist in designing realistic indoctrination and training programs. This study was conducted to fill gaps in our understanding of aircrew perspectives of successful ejections. Methods: Aircrew reporting to the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), Indian Air Force, for post-ejection evaluation during the period of May 2003 to January 2005 completed a questionnaire that was designed for the study. Results: A total of 20 aircrew completed this questionnaire. The mean age of the aircrew was 30.25 ± 4.45 yr. Most of them had logged more than 500 flying hours. Some aircrew described their initial moments of ejection as ""blacked out,"" ""dazed, yet conscious,"" or as ""a shock that gradually decreased."" Practicing ejection drills on the ground, being prepared at all times, making a timely decision to eject, and assuming correct posture were identified as the most important factors for success. Descriptions of ejection as an event suggest intense emotional arousal could occur following ejection.

Selection of causal factors is often distorted by rumors and inaccurate teaching concerning how specific types of injuries occur and/or the consequences of using specific types of Aircrew Automated Escape Systems (AAES) and Aircrew Life Support Systems (ALSS) equipment. Unfortunately, aiding and abetting the selection of incorrect causal factors is the 'strength-in-numbers'-type legitimacy that many of these factors have acquired through frequent usage over the years. Thus, if one should query the Naval Safety Center computer concerning either 1) how many ejectees under certain conditions and/or using specific AAES/ALSS equipment sustained specific injuries, or 2) how many ejectee received a specific type of injury caused by a specific factor, that computer will obligingly and non-critically provide numbers. Because those numbers are generated by a computer, they gain an overwhelming appearance of irrefutability in demonstrating the correctness of any assessment that conforms. Careful, detailed investigation (and also general statistical investigation), however, often has revealed that these accepted causal factors either cannot be applicable or are of extremely doubtful applicability for the specific situations. This paper discusses some of the recent results of investigating many of the accepted causal factors and some methodologies that might aid an investigator in determining the causal factors.

This is a cross-sectional survey-based study on the current urine collection device employed in the U.S. Air Force's U-2S airframe, examining effi cacy, problems with wear, device maintenance, and complaint reporting. Methods: An anonymous survey consisting of 18 questions was generated inquiring about problems with wear of the urine collection system, care of the device, and education. The survey was offered at Beale AFB and overseas U-2 locations to pilots with at least 180 h of flying experience with the airframe. Results: There were 57 subjects who completed the survey with 62.5% reporting complications, including mechanical dysfunction, pain and poor fi t, skin irritation, allergic reaction, embarrassment, and urethral issues. Variation was seen in the degree of problem reporting and care of the device. Discussion and literature review is provided on in-flight and space urine collection and evacuation systems, sheath catheters, urine and contact dermatitis, urethritis, external catheter sizing methods, and psychological aspects of catheter use. Conclusions: The majority of surveyed pilots experienced various problems associated with wear of their urine collection device. Also, variation in reporting and care of the device exists. Potential improvements include standardization of fi tting procedures and device maintenance, increased catheter draining capacity, use of skin barriers to urine, enhanced privacy measures, and incorporation of less injurious structural materials such as silicone.

They were both successfully rescued and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. In this study, we investigate their ejection injuries and recovery process. CASE SUMMARY We analyzed the clinical data of the traumatic condition and recovery process from ejection injuries of two pilots who ejected from a failed trainer jet and survived. After being successfully rescued and sent to the hospital, they were diagnosed with multiple ejection injuries, including eye trauma, limb bone and joint injury, rib and spine injury, and so on. Both cases underwent fluid replacement, acid suppression, nutritional support, hemostasis, bone metabolism improvement, phlegm elimination, psychological measurement, blood circulation promotion and detumescence, physical therapy, and external fixation with braces for 1 mo before being discharged from hospital. They then recuperated in a sanatorium for 2 mo, and the related laboratory tests and supplementary examinations show that they recovered from all the above injuries. After successfully passing the psychological test and physical examination, they returned to flight duty 3 mo after ejection. CONCLUSION The causes and conditions of ejection injury in the pilots were very complex. Although they finally recovered quickly and were released, it also serves as a reminder that attention should be paid to pilots’ ejection and parachute training in order to significantly reduce ejection injury and improve the ejection success rate. In addition, air defense support personnel should strengthen search and rescue and on-site emergency measures, and locate and rescue pilots in distress as early as possible to reduce subsequent injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.

OBJECTIVE.: This preliminary study was undertaken to try and develop an understanding of the factors that may affect recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Clinical recovery from musculoskeletal disabilities is generally achieved after the patient undergoes definitive therapy and rehabilitation. However, a proportion of patients may continue to suffer from morbidity and pain long after clinical and radiological finality has been reached. In these cases, psychosocial factors may have played a contributory role. There has been no research documenting or studying such factors in aviation and pilots in particular. METHODS.: The study was carried out at the Department of Human Engineering from 2004 to 2006. A detailed questionnaire was designed to elicit basic clinical details and psychosocial factors at work and home. RESULTS.: A total of 57 male aircrew participated voluntarily in this study. Of these, 41 (71.9%) achieved normal recovery, whereas in the remaining 16 (28.1%), recovery was considered delayed. The mean age of aircrew in the normal recovery group (33.1 ± 4.6 years) was slightly higher than those in the delayed group (31.0 ± 3.2 years). All the aircrew who had delayed recovery had a spinal disability, whereas spinal disabilities constituted only 46.3% in the normal recovery group. Of the spinal disabilities in aircrew with delayed recovery, 12 had low backache. Aircraft accidents and ejection accounted for almost one-fifth of the total disabilities (n = 11, 21.9%). The respondents identified multiple sources of emotional support viz., friends, family, and parents. CONCLUSION.: A hypothetical model is proposed that possibly explains to some extent the role of psychosocial factors affecting recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities. Further research in psychological and emotional consequences of trauma, in particular ejection and the best means/timings to address these, is recommended. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.</abstract>']"

Heart rates after flights were generally higher than before the same flights. Heart rates on the ground tended to increase over 20-25 hrs of flight instruction. This trend toward increases in heart rates was also observed during dual flights, whether the instructors or students were flying. During solo flight, in contrast, heart rates tended to decrease in most students. Student heart rates were highest during flight checks in eight of nine subjects. These data are indicative of a moderate and sequentially increasing level of psychological stress in students undergoing dual flight instruction in helicopters. The exception to the sequential trend was solo flying. These trends may be a reflection of stress induced by the evaluatory role of the flight instructors.</abstract>', '<title>Impact of real and simulated flights on psychophysiological response of military pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: The present research aimed to analyse the autonomic, anxiety, perceived exertion, and self-confidence response during real and simulated flights. Methods: This cross-sectional study participated 12 experienced male pilots (age = 33.08 (5.21)) from the Spanish Air Force. Participants had to complete a real and a simulated flight mission randomly. The heart rate variability (HRV), anxiety, self-confidence, and rating of perceived exertion were collected before and after both manoeuvres, and HRV was also collected during both simulated and real flights. Results: When studying the acute effects of real and simulated flights, the mean heart rate, the R-to-R interval, the cognitive anxiety and the perceived exertion were significantly impacted only by real flights. Fur-thermore, significant differences in the mean heart rate and RR interval were found when compared to the acute effects of real and simulated flights (with higher acute effects observed in real flights). Additionally, when compared the HRV values during simulated and real flights, significant differences were observed in the RR and heart rate mean (with lower RR interval and higher heart rate mean observed during real flights). Conclusion: Real flights significantly reduced the RR interval and cognitive anxiety while increased the heart rate mean and the rating of perceived exertion, whereas simulated flights did not induce any significant change in the autonomic modulation. © 2021 by the authors.

Method: The subjects performed the same flight mission twice; first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with the BA Hawk MK 51 jet trainer with Gz-forces below +2. The mission included: a) 2 min rest after seating; b) take-off; c) ILS approach in the minimum weather conditions (initial, intermediate and final approach); d) landing tour (visual approach); and e) landing. The heart rates were continuously measured using a small portable recorder developed at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland. The R-R intervals were stored and analyzed with an accuracy of 1 ms. The different phases of each flight were marked in the data by using codes given beforehand for each critical event. Results: The take-off resulted in a significant increase in the heart rate from the resting levels both in the cadets and the flight instructors in both planes. In the simulator the heart rate decreased during the initial approach and slightly increased after it during the intermediate approach. Thereafter the heart rate decreased during the landing tour which seemed to be the least psychologically demanding phase of the simulated flight. The heart rate increased again during the landing but did not exceed the heart rates measured during the take-off and the ILS- approach. There were no statistical differences between the groups. In the jet trainer no decrease in the heart rate could be observed immediately after the take-off, unlike in the case of the simulated flight. The inflight heart rate increased during the final approach, decreased during the landing tour and finally increased during the landing. According to the heart rate analysis the final approach was the most loaded phase of the real flight. The changes towards the phases of final approach and landing were greater among the flight instructors. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between the mean heart rates during the real and the simulated flight. It is suggested that the heart rate changes for most reflected the changes in cognitive workload.</abstract>', '<title>A Comparative Study of Psychophysiological Reactions During Simulator and Real Flight</title> <abstract>During selection tests in a flight simulator and a real aircraft, physiological workload measures were evaluated. The selection context guaranteed high motivation in the participant to exert additional effort during difficult flight tasks. The aim of the study was to obtain information about the sensitivity to mental effort of several physiological measures and to explore the applicability of these measures in real flight. The following measures were used: heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration (frequency and amplitude), blood pressure, eye blinks (frequency, duration, and amplitude), and saliva cortisol. Blood pressure was the only measure that was difficult to obtain during real flights. All physiological measures showed large differences between baseline and flight tasks. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory frequency showed similar results in the simulator and real flight. Blink frequency showed an expected decrease during simulator flight, whereas a large increase was found during real flight. This can be partly explained by eye movements, which were made more frequently during real flight. Blink duration was shorter and amplitude was larger during both flights. This indicates that a combination of blink parameters provides better information about workload than blink frequency alone. Cortisol was not affected by the simulator flight, whereas greatly increased levels were found after the real flight. This indicates that cortisol is not affected by mental effort. G-forces during the real flight most likely caused the increased cortisol levels.</abstract>', '<title>The Effect of Expertise during Simulated Flight Emergencies on the Autonomic Response and Operative Performance in Military Pilots</title> <abstract>Heart rate variability (HRV) and performance response during emergency flight maneuvers were analyzed. Two expert pilots (ages 35 and 33) and two rookie pilots (ages 25) from the Portuguese Air Force participated in this case–control report study. Participants had to complete the following emergency protocols in a flight simulator: (1) take-off engine failure, (2) flight engine failure close to the base, (3) flight engine failure far away from the base, and (4) alternator failure. The HRV was collected during all these maneuvers, as well as the performance data (the time it took to go through the emergency protocol and the subjective information from the flight simulator operator). Results regarding autonomic modulation showed a higher sympathetic response during the emergency maneuvers when compared to baseline. In some cases, there was also a higher sympathetic response during the emergency maneuvers when compared with the take-off protocol. Regarding performance data, the expert pilots accomplished the missions in less time than the rookie pilots. Autonomic modulation measured from HRV through portable devices can easily relay important information. This information is relevant since characterizing these maneuvers can provide helpful information to design training strategies to improve those psychophysiological responses. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>']"

Just as applied sciences such as fluid mechanics and solid-state electronics benefitted from breakthroughs in physics, so it may be expected that social psychology and economics, for example, will similarly benefit from our expanding knowledge of psychosomatic and psychological function. Economics, however, with its basic concepts dating from the nineteenth century, must endure an extensive renewal. Toward this end, a new mathematical theory of behavior was formulated in the early 1990s based on the contributions of prominent psychologists and economists over the past two centuries.

In contrast, several approaches in cognitive engineering argue for a shift of unit of analysis from what is going on in the heads of operators to the workings of whole socio-technical systems. This shift is sometimes presented as part of the development of a new understanding of what cognition is and where the boundaries of cognitive systems are. Cognition, it is claimed, is not just situated or embedded, but extended and distributed in the world. My main question in this article is what the practical significance is of this framing of an expanded unit of analysis in a cognitive vocabulary. I focus on possible consequences for how cognitive engineering practitioners think about function allocation in system design, and on what the relative benefits and costs are of having a common framework and vocabulary for talking about both human and technical system components. I argue for what I call an expansive but deflated conception of cognition, primarily on pragmatic grounds. In addition, I claim that the important lesson of the ""boundaries of cognition"" debate in cognitive science is the negative claim that there is not anything special about the biological boundary of the skin and skull per se, rather than some positive claim about where the boundaries of extended or distributed cognitive systems really are. I also examine the role of the concept of cognition in the theoretical frameworks of distributed cognition, joint cognitive systems (also known as cognitive system engineering), and cognitive work analysis. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Industry Application of Behavioral Science</title> <abstract>One of the more significant errors in the history of science occurred during the ""marginal revolution"" in economics near the end of the nineteenth century. Rather than explicitly recognize in basic theory that the happiness we seek to maximize in life originates within oneself, the early theorists formulated their equations as though human satisfaction resided in external things - as in so much utility (economist\'s term for satisfaction) per pound of sugar. Over the past 125 years, economists have developed mainstream mathematical economics on this incorrect basis resulting in the ill-founded neoclassical Equilibrium Theory. Because of this error economic theory is fundamentally timeless. The present theory, in its canonical form, corrects the early marginalist\'s error by identifying utility (time-integrated pleasure) exclusively with the stream-of-consciousness attending (expected) mental and physical activity. Time is now explicit in basic theory, thereby allowing, for the first time, the substantive computer-modeling of time-dependent, small- and large-scale economic systems. Furthermore, this new approach is methodologically compatible with mainstream sociology and institutional economics, allowing increased interdisciplinary cooperation that may influence policy -and thereby affect industry and markets.

The results provide the first empirical evidence of the performance consequences of automation-induced “complacency”. We relate findings to operator attitudes toward automation and discuss implications for cockpit automation design. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Past research has shown the potential of this advanced form of automation to enhance pilot engagement and lower cognitive workload. However, there have been concerns voiced regarding issues, such as automation surprises, associated with the use of adaptive automation. This study examined the use of psychophysiological self-regulation training with adaptive automation that may help pilots deal with these problems through the enhancement of cognitive resource management skills. Eighteen participants were assigned to 3 groups (self-regulation training, false feedback, and control) and performed resource management, monitoring, and tracking tasks from the Multiple Attribute Task Battery. The tracking task was cycled between 3 levels of task difficulty (automatic, adaptive aiding, manual) on the basis of the electroencephalogram-derived engagement index. The other two tasks remained in automatic mode that had a single automation failure. Those participants who had received self-regulation training performed significantly better and reported lower National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores than participants in the false feedback and control groups. The theoretical and practical implications of these results for adaptive automation are discussed.</abstract>', '<title>Number of Interrupting Events Influences Response Time in Multitasking, but not Trust in Automation</title> <abstract>Objective: The present study examined how the number of interrupting events (interruption load) influences the effect of task load on human-automation trust and resource allocation in a low-fidelity flight simulation environment. Background: Trust is one critical factor that influences successful human-automation interaction. In the previous research, operators reported lower trust scores and made fewer fixation toward an automated system, which assisted a task, when competing task in the same workspace demanded more attention from the operator. However, it is unclear whether human-automation trust is influenced by frequent shift of attention away from a task assisted by an automated signaling system. Methods: Participants concurrently performed a tracking task, a system monitoring task, and a communication task. An automated signaling system was employed to assist the system monitoring task with 70% reliability. Task load was manipulated by the difficulty of the tracking task while interruption load was manipulated by the varying the frequency of auditory messages in the communication task. Results: Results demonstrated an effect of task load on human-automation trust and resource allocation, replicating previous findings. Further, participants responded faster to an auditory message that occurred less frequently when performing a tracking task at the low difficulty level but automation trust did not vary. Conclusion: While operators reported higher trust levels to imperfect automation under lower task load, number of interrupting events does not influence their trust. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Transitioning to future air traffic management: Effects of imperfect automation on controller attention and performance</title> <abstract>Objective: This study examined whether benefits of conflict probe automation would occur in a future air traffic scenario in which air traffic service providers (ATSPs) are not directly responsible for freely maneuvering aircraft but are controlling other nonequipped aircraft (mixed-equipage environment). The objective was to examine how the type of automation imperfection (miss vs. false alarm) affects ATSP performance and attention allocation. Background: Research has shown that the type of automation imperfection leads to differential human performance costs. Method: Participating in four 30-min scenarios were 12 full-performance-level ATSPs. Dependent variables included conflict detection and resolution performance, eye movements, and subjective ratings of trust and self confidence. Results: ATSPs detected conflicts faster and more accurately with reliable automation, as compared with manual performance. When the conflict probe automation was unreliable, conflict detection performance declined with both miss (25% conflicts detected) and false alarm automation (50% conflicts detected). Conclusion: When the primary task of conflict detection was automated, even highly reliable yet imperfect automation (miss or false alarm) resulted in serious negative effects on operator performance. Application: The further in advance that conflict probe automation predicts a conflict, the greater the uncertainty of prediction; thus, designers should provide users with feedback on the state of the automation or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of the data underlying the conflict probe algorithm. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>']"

It is as much a threat to the viability of online social networks for youth today as spam once was to email in the early days of the Internet. Current work to tackle this problem has involved social and psychological studies on its prevalence as well as its negative effects on adolescents. While true solutions rest on teaching youth to have healthy personal relationships, few have considered innovative design of social network software as a tool for mitigating this problem. Mitigating cyberbullying involves two key components: robust techniques for effective detection and reflective user interfaces that encourage users to reflect upon their behavior and their choices. Spam filters have been successful by applying statistical approaches like Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. They can, like Googles GMail, aggregate human spam judgments because spam is sent nearly identically to many people. Bullying is more personalized, varied, and contextual. In this work, we present an approach for bullying detection based on state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense knowledge base, which permits recognition over a broad spectrum of topics in everyday life. We analyze a more narrow range of particular subject matter associated with bullying (e.g. appearance, intelligence, racial and ethnic slurs, social acceptance, and rejection), and construct BullySpace, a common sense knowledge base that encodes particular knowledge about bullying situations. We then perform joint reasoning with common sense knowledge about a wide range of everyday life topics. We analyze messages using our novel AnalogySpace common sense reasoning technique. We also take into account social network analysis and other factors. We evaluate the model on real-world instances that have been reported by users on Formspring, a social networking website that is popular with teenagers. On the intervention side, we explore a set of reflective user-interaction paradigms with the goal of promoting empathy among social network participants. We propose an ""air traffic control""-like dashboard, which alerts moderators to large-scale outbreaks that appear to be escalating or spreading and helps them prioritize the current deluge of user complaints. For potential victims, we provide educational material that informs them about how to cope with the situation, and connects them with emotional support from others. A user evaluation shows that in-context, targeted, and dynamic help during cyberbullying situations fosters end-user reflection that promotes better coping strategies. © 2012 ACM.</abstract>', '<title>Ethical considerations when working with older adults in psychology</title> <abstract>The growing number of older adults in America will result in an increasing demand for psychotherapists familiar with their psychological needs. To treat this population in an ethical manner, practitioners need to be aware of the unique characteristics of the aging process, especially in regards to age-related vulnerabilities, such as cognitive decline. Unfortunately, recent research has shown that those currently in practice do not have sufficient knowledge of the aging process and age specific issues of older adults. To address these deficits the American Psychological Association published a report outlining six general concepts: attitudes, general knowledge about adult development, clinical issues, assessment, intervention, and education. These concepts are described. Furthermore, this article extends the current thinking on ethical issues regarding older adults by addressing their vulnerabilities. In addition, ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, and elder abuse are addressed as they apply to both clinical and research situations. In addition, methods of resolving these important issues are suggested throughout the article.

Also, some pilots will sustain head injuries that will affect their flying careers. The complex and unforgiving nature of aviation demands a conservative approach to occupational return after neurological insult. Therefore, a neuropsychological assessment is required to return to flying. The lack of pre-injury neuropsychological data, however, hinders accurate assessment of post-injury functioning. Hypotheses: a) Psychological data may improve the pilot selection and assignment processes as military resources dwindle; and b) baseline intellectual/cognitive data may support the scientific basis of aeromedical decision-making. Methods: Neuropsychiatrically Enhanced Flight Screening (N-EFS) attempts to validate the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB), CogScreen, Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PI-R), and Personal Characteristics Inventory (PCI) for pilot selection and cockpit assignment. N-EFS also measures baseline intelligence (using the MAB) and cognitive functioning (using the CogScreen) for comparison purposes if a future medical flying waiver is needed after neurological insult. These assessments will compare the aviator's postinjury functioning to a personal intellectual functioning baseline captured at entry into aviation training. Results: N-EFS students are scoring from below average to very superior in intellectual assessment. Very preliminary personality testing results suggest few significant differences between male and female student pilots, with high extraversion being the most striking personality characteristic.

Efforts to effectively screen aviators for these disorders are continually sought, as under-diagnosis may negatively impact aviation safety. This study evaluates screening tools that have been validated in non-aviators in terms of their utility for aviator patients. Methods: There were 111 male aviation patients (27 ± 7 yr) referred for psychiatric evaluation at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute who completed the Self-Administered Alcohol Screening Test (SAAST), the Alcohol-Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Common Alcohol Logistical Scale-Revised (CAL-R) prior to evaluation by a staff psychiatrist or psychologist. Results: There were 40 patients who were qualified psychiatrically with no diagnosis and 49 patients who were disqualified for psychiatric reasons due to a non alcohol-related diagnosis. The remaining 22 patients were disqualified for psychiatric reasons with an alcohol-related diagnosis. The optimal aviator cut-off scores were consistent with those of the general population, although the cut-off score used for the SAAST was set at the published sub-threshold level to provide greater sensitivity. The sensitivity/specificity values for the SAAST, AUDIT, and CAL-R were 59%/94%, 46%/96%, and 68%/81%, respectively. Conclusion: The psychometrically sophisticated CAL-R is sensitive, specific, and has good negative predictive value, although its use requires a psychologist and its availability is limited. The SAAST and AUDIT can be administered by a flight surgeon or aviation medical examiner (AME). Given the higher sensitivity of the SAAST it may be the most beneficial if administered first. The AUDIT can be used as a follow-up diagnostic test given its higher specificity.

However, subtle but safety-significant post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments may go unreported or undetected. The Trail Making Test (TMT) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) can detect these impairments in domains essential to pilot performance, though further investigation is needed to assess their effectiveness and clinical utility in routine pilot aeromedical examinations. This short communication presents preliminary findings for using these tests. METHODS: A study identified the TMT and SDMT as appropriate screening tools for evaluating pilot neurocognitive performance after COVID-19. Mixed methods were then used to compare the screening tools' performance between post-COVID-19 cases and healthy controls, while also assessing their acceptability and feasibility in routine aeromedical examinations for pilots. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 neurocognitive disorders affect skills that are essential for pilot performance. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tests, with area under the curve values of 0.853 for TMT Part B, 0.817 for the SDC version of SDMT, and 0.769 for TMT Part A, indicating their effectiveness in identifying cognitive impairments. Airline pilots considered screening an important flight safety intervention. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots, together with international aviation psychologists and aviation medicine experts, endorsed the safety-critical importance and value of screening pilots for post-COVID-19 impairments. Given the numerous practical implications of implementing such a strategy, we recommend that pilots be screened for potential post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments. A larger study is necessary to validate these preliminary findings and recommendations. Beka SG, Griffiths RF, Myers JA, Skirrow PM.

A sufficiently sensitive screening test of cognitive function, based on the typical cognitive effects of COVID-19 and skills considered most relevant to pilot performance, would be highly beneficial to be used alongside other performance checks. This study aimed to identify appropriate screening tests for post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: I nitially, a systematic search and narrative review identified 13 screening tools that are likely to be effective in screening pilots for post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairment. Following a more in-depth evaluation of the identified tools, five tests including the Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Color Word Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were chosen for a Delphi evaluation exercise. A two-round modified Delphi process was undertaken with international aviation medicine and psychology experts to obtain a consensus on which of the identified tests would be appropriate to screen for cognitive dysfunction in pilots. RESULTS: Based on evaluation of literature review findings and Delphi consultation with subject matter experts, the Trail Making Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were identified as quick and suitable screening tests likely to detect post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. DISCUSSION: T hese tools are objective, have good utility, are available in multiple versions, and assess cognitive abilities relevant to pilot performance.

External aids such as note-taking help pilots manage communication demands, and may especially benefit older pilots. Emerging technologies provide new opportunities for external aids that are integrated with other systems. We compared an electronic notepad (epad) positioned next to the instrument panel of a flight simulator to conventional note-taking (kneepad) on a read-back task. In Experiment 1, 6 older and 6 younger instrument-rated pilots listened to and read back ATC messages while using the epad, kneepad, or no aid. Epad use in this communication-only condition was compared to a condition in which pilots used the epad to support communication while flying the simulator. Read-back accuracy was higher when pilots used either aid compared to no aid, and the pattern of results suggested a smaller age difference with either aid than in the no-aid condition. Accuracy supported by the epad was not reduced in the multitask condition, suggesting the epad would support communication during flight.

Participants accepted aircraft into sectors and detected aircraft conflicts during an air traffic control simulation. They were sometimes required to substitute new actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft traveling at certain speeds or altitudes, or with certain call signs. In Experiment 1, prospective memory error increased with intent to deviate from strong compared to weak routine, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to speed intentions. In addition, errors increased when intentions were general compared to specific. Participants also missed more conflicts when deviating from strong compared to weak routine. In Experiment 2, errors increased for intentions nonfocal to ongoing tasks compared to focal, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to call sign intentions. Participants were slower to accept aircraft when holding nonfocal compared to focal intentions, and slower to accept aircraft and detect conflicts when holding focal intentions compared to no intentions. These findings are consistent with theories that assume that individuals allocate limited-capacity attentional resources to prospective memory tasks. Increased error for altitude intentions, together with the effect of routine strength, suggest a vulnerability to error with increased strength of association between prospective memory cues and competing ongoing tasks. Ongoing tasks that focus attention on cues may sometimes impair, rather than benefit, intention retrieval. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>', '<title>Reducing prospective memory error and costs in simulated air traffic control: External aids, extending practice, and removing perceived memory requirements</title> <abstract>In air traffic control (ATC), forgetting to perform deferred actions-prospective memory (PM) errors- can have severe consequences.

We examined the extent to which PM errors and costs were reduced in simulated ATC by providing extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with instructions that removed perceived memory requirements. Participants accepted/handed-off aircraft and detected conflicts. For the PM task, participants were required to substitute alternative actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft. In Experiment 1, when no aids were provided, PM errors and costs were not reduced by practice. When aids were provided, costs observed early in practice were eliminated with practice, but residual PM errors remained. Experiment 2 provided more limited practice with aids, but instructions that did not frame the PM task as a ""memory"" task led to high PM accuracy without costs.

Sessions began at about 5.00 p.m. and continued through midnight to about 11:00 a.m. the next day. Subjects were tested in groups of three or four and were not told whether they were drinking alcohol or placebo. The ordering of sessions was approximately counterbalanced. Subjects were given all tests in the evening (before and after a monitored dinner), drank prepared beverages from 8:30 p.m. to midnight, and were tested again. subjects slept 4 to 5 hr. They were awakened around 7:00 a.m., fed and asked to perform all tasks again, beginning at 8:00 a.m. (8 hr after they had finished drinking). Results showed clear deleterious effects of alcohol on the MTPB and the tracking tasks immediately following drinking. During the morning (hangover) tests, scores on the MTPB and on the static and dynamic tracking tasks showed small circadian effects (scores were better) without impairment due to the alcohol. There were no congener effects. These results offer no evidence contrary to the '8 hour rule'.</abstract>""]"

A cross-sectional survey was used to determine the self-reported 1-yr prevalence of neck pain and to compare individual, work-related, and flight-related characteristics in F-16 pilots with and without neck pain. Method: There were 90 male F-16 pilots of the Belgian Air Force and The Royal Netherlands Air Force who voluntarily completed an anonymous survey. Resorts: The 1-yr prevalence of neck pain was 18.9%. Pilots were divided into two groups: healthy (HG) and neck pain group (NPG). This study could not identify individual or specific flight-related differences between these two groups. High force demands, often sitting for a long time, frequently holding the neck in a forward bent posture, and being physically tired were all physical work-related factors that were reported significantly more often in the NPG. The NPG also reported significantly more psychosocial factors, such as being mentally tired at the end of the day and being annoyed by others at the workplace. Discussion: Since the specific flight-related factors were not significantly different between the HG and the NPG, physical and psychosocial factors could have been important factors in the development or maintenance of neck pain in F-16 pilots. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight for the first time that, in addition to flight-related issues, other aspects must be considered in analyzing neck pain. These other aspects stress the importance of a broader approach when considering neck pain, even in this population that is exposed to very high loads during flight.

The Aircrew Conditioning Programme and direct access physiotherapy exist to minimise the impact on military capability, but a population specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) is required to investigate the effectiveness of these. We aimed to explore the experiences of flight-related neck pain to inform the content validity and development of a population specific PROM. Methods Qualitative semistructured interviews combining phenomenological and grounded theory methods, reported using Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines. A purposive sample of 10 fast jet pilots with neck pain was recruited. Concept elicitation interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim along with field notes. Data analysis involved subject and methodological expertise used a concept elicitation approach. Results Participants included 10 male fast jet pilots, age 34.7 years. Identified themes included: (1) physical symptoms associated with flying activities; (2) occupational effects revealed modifications of flying, or suboptimal' performance owing to neck pain; (3) psychological effects revealed feelings or worry and (4) social and activity effects showed impact on out of work time.

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and degree of the pain intensity in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, subjective risk factors and their effect on the pilots' performance while flying high maneuver aircrafts and the consequences for cognitive deficiencies. Material and Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective, anonymous questionnaire survey, collecting data on the age, aircraft type, flying hours, pain characteristics, physical activity, etc. The study was participated by 94 pilots aged 28-45 years (mean age: 35.9±3.3 years), actively flying fast jet aircrafts Su-22, Mig-29 and F-16. The estimates regarding the level of the subjective back pain were established using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: The values of the Cochran and Cox T-test for heterogeneous variances are as follows: for the total number of flying hours: F = 2.53, p = 0.0145, for the pilot's age: F = 3.15, p = 0.003, and for the BMI factor F = 2.73, p = 0.008. Conclusions: Our questionnaire survey showed a significant problem regarding spinal conditions in high performance aircraft pilots. The determination of the risk factors may lead to solving this problem and help eliminate the effect of the unfavorable environment on piloting jet aircrafts. Experiencing back pain during the flight might influence the mission performance and flight safety. The costs of pilots education are enormous and inability to fly, or even disability, leads to considerable economic loss.

There is currently no consensus regarding the best training methods for this population. Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) and Luke AFB have multidisciplinary teams specializing in aircrew training, performance, and injury mitigation. All student pilots (SPs) completing Basic Course training at these locations engage in an 8-week Spine Training Program (STP). The STP originated at Luke AFB in 2020 and was expanded to Eglin AFB in 2022. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether the STP led to significant changes in the performance measure studied, Cervical Endurance Hold (CEH). Further, this study aimed to determine if the CEH training effect was independent of location of STP administration. We hypothesized that SPs would exhibit statistically significant CEH training adaptations irrespective of base location. Materials and Methods: Air Force F-16 and F-35 SPs from Luke AFB and Eglin AFB were actively enrolled in the Basic Course and participated in the standardized STP from 2020 to 2023. The CEH test was administered prior to (intake) and following (exit) the 8-week STP. SPSS for Windows version 29 software (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to retrospectively analyze the data from this study. Participants were excluded if they were unable to perform the CEH test at intake or exit. The study was approved by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Results: One hundred and ninety-eight SPs (Luke AFB, males n = 170, females n = 12; Eglin AFB, males n = 16) completed the STP program. There was no significant difference between intake and exit concerning age, height, weight, % body fat, and fat-free mass at Luke AFB or Eglin AFB (P < 0.05). Statistically significant improvements in CEH were observed within all groups from intake to exit (P < 0.001). When considering all participants collectively, there was a notable 33.6% increase in CEH from intake to exit (P < 0.001) with an overall effect size of d = 1.14. When analyzing specific subgroups, females from Luke AFB experienced a significant 20.4% increase in CEH (P < 0.001, d = 1.14), males from Luke AFB exhibited a significant 34.5% increase (P < 0.001, d = 1.09), and males from Eglin AFB demonstrated a significant increase of 55.7% in CEH (P < 0.001, d = 1.97). Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed significant improvements in the CEH across all groups following the completion of the STP. Furthermore, CEH results from both bases exhibited a large effect size indicating a meaningful change was found between intake and exit regardless of training location. These preliminary study results should be interpreted with caution as a control group was unable to be established. In the future, a randomized control trial should be performed to test the STP used in this study against other STP programs.

Despite the high prevalence of neck pain and growing operational demands, there remains no consensus regarding best practices for mitigating aircrew pain and injury. Although most pilot training locations have established aircrew performance teams, only select locations have mandated training hours to support injury mitigation training. Eglin Air Force Base (EAFB) F-35A student pilots (SPs) engage in a mandatory 8-week standardized spine training program (STP). In contrast, the F-15E Flying Course at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (SJAFB) does not have syllabus hours to support the STP, resulting in the capability to utilize this site as a comparison group for this analysis. The primary objective of this study was to determine if completion of the STP led to significant differences in the Cervical Endurance Hold (CEH). We hypothesized that SPs would exhibit significant training adaptations only if they had dedicated training hours that could support the completion of the STP. Materials and Methods: SPs from EAFB who were actively enrolled in the F-35A Flying Course from 2022 to 2024 participated in an 8-week STP. The CEH test was administered before the start of the Flying Course (pre-flying training), after the 8-week STP intervention (post-8 week), after the air-to-air phase of training (post air-to-air), and after the completion of the Flying Course (post-flying training). SPs from SJAFB who were actively enrolled in the F-15E Flying Course from 2022 to 2024 did not participate in the standardized STP. The CEH test was administered before the Flying Course (pre-flying training) and following the completion of the Flying Course (post-flying training). JMP 16.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) was used to retrospectively analyze the data from this study. Results: There was a significant effect from the STP between the intervention (EAFB) and comparison (SJAFB) groups (F(1,81.28) = 7.456; P = .008). Additionally, the STP had a significantly positive effect on CEH time, following the initial 8-week intervention (pre-training = 96.28s ± (37.95s), 8-week = 132.81 seconds ± (30.96s) P < .001), which was maintained throughout the duration of the Flying Course (pre-training = 96.28s ± (37.95s), post-training = 117.34s ± (29.73s) P = .013). Conclusions: The study results show a significant improvement in CEH outcomes after the 8-week STP intervention, which was not seen at the comparison site. Notably, the benefits of the STP at the intervention site were sustained even after the Flying Course was completed, indicating that the program may have a sustained protective effect. Future analysis of flight profiles between locations that implement the STP and those that do not should be conducted. This comparison could help determine whether the STP is contributing to a reduction in duty limitations. Furthermore, if a relationship exists, these findings may provide valuable insights for experts seeking the most effective spine training methods to mitigate pain, injury, and attrition in fighter aircrew. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2025.</abstract>']"

Background: In recent years the proportion of male cabin crew has increased, still few studies have investigated gender differences in PSYJS and MSP in this occupational group. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire concerning work-related psychosocial demands, control, social support, and MSP was answered by 107 male and 329 female cabin crew members from the three major airline companies in Norway. Binary logistic regression models were used for the analysis. Results: There were no gender differences in PSYJS, but female cabin crew reported higher levels of social support from colleagues (p =\xa0.001) and nearest supervisor (p =\xa0.006). Multi-site MSP was reported by 70%. No gender differences in prevalence of single-site or multi-site MSP were found, except from a higher prevalence of pain in feet in female cabin crew (p =\xa0.020). Both a high strain (33%) and a passive (17%) work situation were associated with significantly higher risks of most single and multi-site MSP.

Despite this, there is little knowledge about work-related stress and subjective health complaints (SHCs) affecting Norwegian aircrew. Aims To investigate the relationships between work-related stress, self-efficacy and SHCs in commercial aircrew in Norway and to explore differences between cockpit and cabin crew. Methods Aircrew members from the three major airlines operating from Norway completed an electronically distributed questionnaire. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between work-related stress, self-efficacy and SHCs. Results There was a 21% response rate. Among the 843 study subjects, tiredness, sleep problems, bloating, low back pain, headaches and neck pain were the most prevalent SHCs. Cabin crew reported significantly higher numbers, prevalences and mean values for all SHCs compared with cockpit crew (P < 0.05). In total, 20% reported high stress levels. High levels of work-related stress were significantly associated with all SHC factors in both groups. Self-efficacy partly moderated the relationship between stress and psychological complaints in both cockpit and cabin crew, and for musculoskeletal complaints in cockpit crew. The model explained 23 and 32% of the variance in psychological complaints for cockpit and cabin crew, respectively. Conclusions Commercial aircrew in Norway reported high numbers of SHCs, and high levels of work-related stress were associated with high numbers of SHC. More knowledge is needed on the physical, organizational and psychosocial stressors affecting cockpit and cabin crew in order to create a healthier work environment for these groups.</abstract>', '<title>Psychosocial risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the lower-back among long-haul international female flight attendants</title> <abstract>Title. Psychosocial risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the lower-back among long-haul international female flight attendants Aim. This paper is a report of a study to examine the relationships between work-related psychosocial factors and lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders among long-haul international female flight attendants. Background. Recent attention has focused on the influence of work-related psychosocial factors on work-related musculoskeletal disorders. To date, however, little is known about the influence of psychosocial factors at work on lower back work-related musculoskeletal disorders in female flight attendants. Method. A cross-sectional, mailed survey was conducted in 2004 with flight attendants in one major airline who were randomly selected from a union membership list. The work-related psychosocial factors included psychological job demand, decision latitude, social support, job insecurity, and external environmental concerns. Physical load was defined by overall strenuousness across 41 job tasks and measured by a 4-point scale of strenuousness. Lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders were defined as lower-back symptoms that occurred at least once a month or lasted at least 1 week in the past year and caused at least moderate pain. Findings. The flight attendants with lower back work-related musculoskeletal disorders, compared with those without lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders, had higher perceived psychological job demands, job insecurity, and physical load. After controlling for physical load and personal factors, high job insecurity significantly increased the risk for lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion. Occupational health nurses in the airline industry should be cognizant of the importance of assessing the influence of both job tasks and work-related psychosocial factors on lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract>', ""<title>Self-assessed occupational health and working environment of female nurses, cabin crew and teachers</title> <abstract>Aim: The aim of this study was to describe and compare the self-assessed occupational health among female nurses, cabin crew and teachers, in relation to their working environment. Background: Similarities between the three occupations, i.e. predominantly female and service-oriented, render them interesting in comparison with respect to health and working environment. Methods: The participants were female Icelandic cabin crew, nurses and elementary school teachers. A questionnaire including items on socio-demographics, working environment (addressing work pace, job security, monotonous work, assistance, physically strenuous work and physical environmental factors) and a symptom list was used for data collection. Factor analyses on the symptom list resulted in five symptom scales: Musculoskeletal, Stress and exhaustion, Common cold, Gastrointestinal and Sound perception scale. A total of 1571 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 65.7-69%, depending on occupation. Data were collected in 2002. Results: Cabin crew reported worse gastrointestinal, sound perception and common cold symptoms than nurses and teachers. Cabin crew and teachers reported worse symptoms of stress and exhaustion than nurses (p < 0.05). When compared with teachers and nurses cabin crew reported less job security and more physically strenuous and monotonous work. Nurses were likelier to seek assistance from co-workers or patients as well as to take care of an older relative than teachers and cabin crew. Regression analysis found that within each occupation distress from environmental factors resulted in higher score on all the symptom scales. Conclusions: Nurses experience less stress and exhaustion than teachers and cabin crew. In comparison with one or both of the other occupations nurses are more likely to assist each other with their work, experience job security, reporting physically complex work and take care of older relatives.

Interest centered on different frame-of-reference representations. The north-up map emphasized consistency of object location, characteristic of an earth-centered frame of reference. The track-up map emphasized map-terrain congruency, characteristic of an ego-centered frame of reference. Twenty skilled pilots used the maps to complete several navigational tasks that occurred within a realistic simulation program tailored for helicopter navigation. Findings revealed an interesting pattern of map-task dependencies.

For elevation errors, there was a main effect for the type of display with worst performance for the purely auditory condition; elevation judgments were worse for larger elevation separations independent of display condition. Finally, elevation performance was superior when target images were aligned close to the major meridian orthogonal to the viewing vector.

Results show moderate to high correlations between 2 social competence questionnaires and certain personality dimensions, although only 1 social competence questionnaire (the Social Skills Inventory [SSI]) confirms systematic common variance with the behavior-oriented assessments of related concepts in the AC. In addition to traditional selection procedures, the SSI could neither improve the prediction of applicants' overall performance in pilot selection nor did it show substantial intercorrelations with an external criterion in the pilot training.

Background: It is thus far unclear how preparation relates to IM in real-world and high-stakes settings. This is of particular importance for the aviation industry, because numerous commercial providers offer preparation courses for selection procedures potentially impacting selection decisions. Method: We conducted a field study of high-stakes job interviews embedded in a selection procedure for airline pilots. Data from 100 interviewees was acquired. Results: The variety of preparation strategies an applicant used was positively correlated with two deceptive IM (faking) strategies in the job interview. Moreover, low effort preparation via social media and guidebooks was positively correlated with overall faking. The variety of preparation and preparation via social media were also positively correlated with honest IM. However, neither the aforementioned preparation nor IM showed significant correlations with the interview performance.

Participants were 170 USAF officers with RPA Initial Flight Screening (RFS) outcomes and 110 USAF officers with RPA Instrument Qualification (RIQ) outcomes. Both RFS and RIQ emphasize development of skills traditionally required for manned aircraft pilots, also considered essential for USAF RPA pilots. Results showed significant negative relationships between the Big Five personality trait of Openness and several RPA training outcomes, and significant incremental variance explained by Openness beyond other predictors. Additionally, RFS and RIQ training outcomes were generally predicted by measures traditionally used for selection into manned aircraft pilot training courses and careers. Together, these findings suggest that personality, specifically Openness scores, and scores on traditional pilot selection measures, can serve as useful indicators in the early identification of RPA pilot talent. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

Results were analyzed to determine long-term consequences of the war imprisonment experience. We hypothesized that individuals experiencing the greatest stress and frustration might believe they gained more psychologically than those less stressed. The questionnaire results indicated a distinct subgroup of POWs for which this was particularly true, although the subjective sense of feeling somehow “benefited” by the experience was by no means universal. This study supports the hypothesis that the subjective sense of having benefited from the experience of war imprisonment is positively correlated with the harshness of the experience. © 1980, American Medical Association.

This study utilized archival data from 42 treatment facilities as part of ongoing program evaluation of the Air Force Medical Service's Behavioral Health Optimization Program. Setting. This study was conducted in a large managed health care organization for active duty military and their families, with specific clinic settings that varied considerably in regards to geographic location, population diversity and size of patient empanelment. Study participants. De-identified archival data on 534 primary care team members were examined. Results. Team members at larger facilities rated access and acuity concerns as greater barriers than those from smaller facilities (t(533) = 2.57, P < 0.05). Primary Care Managers (PCMs) not only identified more barriers to integrated care (β = -0.07, P < 0.01) but also found services more helpful to the primary care team (t(362.52) = 1.97, P = 0.05). Barriers to care negatively impacted perceived helpfulness of integrated care services for patients (β = -0.12, P < 0.01) and team members, particularly among non-PCMs (β = -0.11, P < 0.01). Conclusions. Findings highlight the potential benefits of targeted training that differs in facilities of larger empanelment and is mindful of team members' individual roles in a Patient Centered Medical Home. In particular, although generally few barriers were perceived, given the impact these barriers have on perception of care, efforts should be made to decrease perceived barriers to integrated behavioural health care among non-PCM team members. © The Author 2016.

Recent studies have explored multi-biosignal fusion to monitor these states. Despite these efforts, existing methods fail to reflect the complexity and usefulness of various modalities, and do not consider the informativeness of biosignals based on signal quality or the contribution of each modality as biomarkers. To address this issue, we introduce dynamic multi-biosignal fusion (DMBF) to detect the mental states of drivers and passengers. DMBF employs a dynamic gate mechanism that estimates reliability based on data quality through confidence-aware learning, integrating this information into the learning process. Moreover, a spatial-temporal attention module is utilized to capture and combine key biosignal patterns across channels and time. Extensive evaluations were conducted on five datasets related to motion sickness, drowsiness, distraction, emotions, and sustained attention. Each dataset yielded F1 scores of 0.5569, 0.7187, 0.6647, 0.9378, and 0.8092, respectively, outperforming existing baseline models. The experimental results and ablation studies have demonstrated that DMBF is a more robust and versatile method for detecting the mental states of drivers and passengers.

However, due to the uneven distribution of shared bikes and randomization of user behavior, the urban dockless bicycle sharing system (UDBSS) faces issues of randomization. Since rebalancing in UDBSS involves the opinion and preference of multiple stakeholders, it can be modeled as a group consensus problem. Nevertheless, mutual influence among users, changing preferences, and psychological inconsistencies, along with the absence of personalized strategies in traditional methods, adversely affect demand decisions for UDBSS. To address this issue, this paper innovatively combines random vector functional link (RVFL) networks, quantum theory (QT), and prospect–regret theory (P–RT), to construct a personalized two-stage group consensus framework. First, with the support of three-way decisions, an improved K-means++ algorithm based on Euclidean distances and Hausdorff distances is used for clustering, which reduces the uncertainty in the UDBSS problem. Additionally, to address the randomization issue, RVFL is used to calculate intragroup user weights, and the chimp optimization algorithm (CHOA) is applied for the hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, considering users’ psychological behavior, a two-stage consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed, and a personalized adjustment mechanism based on QT, P–RT, and hesitation degrees is proposed. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a shared bicycle deployment scenario, with experimental analysis using data from the Citi Bike system and survey data to verify its effectiveness and feasibility. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Emotion Transition Recognition Using Multimodal Physiological Signal Fusion</title> <abstract>Most existing emotion recognition studies rely on discrete stimulus paradigms under controlled laboratory conditions, failing to capture the inherently dynamic and transitional nature of emotional states encountered in real-world operational environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach for emotion transition recognition using multimodal physiological signal fusion. Thirty participants, including 10 licensed pilots and 20 non-pilots controls, were recruited to view 48 video stimuli de-signed to elicit six distinct emotional transitions. We introduce a two-stage progressive recognition framework to enhance performance in emotional transition modeling. In Stage I, differential entropy features extracted from EEG signals are integrated with Big Five personality traits to construct an occupation-based trait classification model, capturing cognitive-emotional patterns associated with occupational background and providing individualized priors. In Stage II, we develop the temporal spatial embed ding bidirectional cross-attention fusion network (TSE-BCAF), which employs parallel convolutional modules to extract deep spatial features from multimodal EEG and EOG signals. These features are fused via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to model inter-modal interactions, then processed by a Trans former-based temporal encoder to capture the evolving dynamics of emotional transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal baselines in both accuracy and robustness. The findings highlight the potential of our approach for real-world applications in aviation psychology and other high stakes domains requiring adaptive emotional regulation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.</abstract>', '<title>FLDQN: Cooperative Multi-Agent Federated Reinforcement Learning for Solving Travel Time Minimization Problems in Dynamic Environments Using SUMO Simulation</title> <abstract>The increasing volume of traffic has led to severe challenges, including traffic congestion, heightened energy consumption, increased air pollution, and prolonged travel times. Addressing these issues requires innovative approaches for optimizing road network utilization. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in dynamic scenarios like traffic management, their primary focus has been on single-agent setups, limiting their applicability to real-world multi-agent systems. Managing agents and fostering collaboration in a multi-agent reinforcement learning scenario remains a challenging task. This paper introduces a cooperative multi-agent federated reinforcement learning algorithm named FLDQN to address the challenge of agent cooperation by solving travel time minimization challenges in dynamic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios. FLDQN leverages federated learning to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among intelligent agents, optimizing vehicle routing and reducing congestion in dynamic traffic environments. Using the SUMO simulator, multiple agents equipped with deep Q-learning models interact with their local environments, share model updates via a federated server, and collectively enhance their policies using unique local observations while benefiting from the collective experiences of other agents. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FLDQN achieves a significant average reduction of over 34.6% in travel time compared to non-cooperative methods while simultaneously lowering the computational overhead through distributed learning. FLDQN underscores the vital impact of agent cooperation and provides an innovative solution for enabling agent cooperation in a multi-agent environment. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>XGate: Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Transparent and Trustworthy API Traffic Management in IoT Sensor Networks</title> <abstract>The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their associated application programming interfaces (APIs) has significantly increased the complexity of sensor network traffic management, necessitating more sophisticated and transparent control mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce XGate, a novel explainable reinforcement learning framework designed specifically for API traffic management in sensor networks. XGate addresses the critical challenge of balancing optimal routing decisions with the interpretability demands of network administrators operating large-scale IoT deployments. Our approach integrates transformer-based attention mechanisms with counterfactual reasoning to provide human-comprehensible explanations for each traffic management decision across distributed sensor data streams. Through extensive experimentation on three large-scale sensor API traffic datasets, we demonstrate that XGate achieves 23.7% lower latency and 18.5% higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art black-box reinforcement learning approaches. More importantly, our user studies with sensor network administrators ( (Formula presented.) ) reveal that XGate’s explanation capabilities improve operator trust by 67% and reduce intervention time by 41% during anomalous sensor traffic events. The theoretical analysis further establishes probabilistic guarantees on explanation fidelity while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time sensor data management.

The first comprises the residues of wartime radar stations dotted along the Australian coastline. Sustained by generators and cabling, their electromagnetic beams projected a new domain of national sovereignty into the skies: airspace. The second case is the Cotton Aerodynamic Anti-G suit, a rubberised outfit designed to protect fighter pilots from ‘blackout’ during high-G manoeuvres.

Results provide strong support for the effectiveness of this team training in improving critical team competencies.</abstract>', '<title>Team Performance in Air Combat: A Teamwork Perspective</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe a model combining taskwork and teamwork of a single-seat fighter aircraft team, or flight, during its performance episode. Background: In air combat, evaluations of team performance have focused on task performance. However, both teamwork and taskwork are required for high performance output. Attempts to address taskwork and teamwork in single-seat fighter aircraft flights have mainly settled for adopting existing models of teamwork to flights. As such, they have overlooked the unique nature of teamwork in air combat. Method: Existing models of teamwork and taskwork are reviewed and a flight’s tactical decision-making is described as an input-process-output model. A model combining flight’s teamwork, taskwork, situation awareness and transactive memory is conceptualized and operation of the model is illustrated with a case study. In the case study, the model is used to provide an alternative explanation for an air combat accident. Results: The model bridges the gap between the well-established concepts of teamwork and the unique nature of air combat. It rationalizes how the mission essential competencies, situation awareness and transactive memory interact with each other, and how they impact the flight’s performance output. Conclusions: The model helps scholars and practitioners in identifying the connection between the flight’s performance output and the underlying processes even when cause and effect are not adjacent in either time or space. © 2023 The Author(s).

The industry has never looked at nor tested content comprehension or retention on this subject. We decided to conduct a sample testing of crews' ability to understand and retain survival training material. Methods: This study solicited the participation of four program crews that had received previous training in safety and survival. A test on safety and survival training content was administrated to nurses and paramedics before a refresher course (test 1), then immediately after the course (test 2), and again 6 months later (test 3). Ninety-six crew members took tests 1 and 2, and 79 (82%) took test 3. Results: The average time since any crew member participating in this study had attended a survival course was 1 to 1.5 years, the pretraining test mean score was 60 (60%); the posttraining average score was 92 (92%); and the 6-month mean score was 65 (65%). Conclusion: Flight crews do not retain a safe level of survival skill knowledge with annual recurrent training. Therefore the industry needs to reevaluate its position on this standard of annual recurrent training. Survival training is too important for flight crews to undertake only once per year.

Air medical personnel frequently face the challenge of the emergency airway. The Combitube is an airway device commonly used by emergency medical services (EMS) providers as either a primary or rescue airway. Objective. We sought to evaluate the performance and preference of air medical personnel using a newer laryngeal tube airway device, the King LT, versus the Combitube in a simulator model. Methods. Participants included flight physicians, nurses, and paramedics in our air medical transport program. Twenty-seven subjects participated. Participants received a 10-minute instructional program, and then had individual practice with each device. Participants were tested on the insertion of each device in a Laerdal SimMan. Rates of successful placement, time to successful placement, and practitioner preference were recorded. Perceived ease of insertion was measured on a five-point scale (1 easy, 5 difficult). Results. All 27 participants correctly placed each device. Mean time to placement was 24.4 seconds (standard deviation [SD] of 4.7 seconds) for the King LT and 37.9 seconds (SD of 5.9 seconds) for the Combitube. The difference in mean times was 13.5 seconds (p < 0.0001). For the participants' perceived ease of insertion, the mean score for the King LT was 1.3 and that for the Combitube was 2.5. Twenty-six of 27 participants preferred the King LT over the Combitube. Conclusions. The King LT was placed significantly faster than the Combitube and was also perceived as easier to place. Ninety-six percent of the participants preferred the King LT. Limitations include using a simulator model rather than a human model. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.</abstract>"", ""<title>Critical action procedures testing: A novel method for test-enhanced learning</title> <abstract>Context: Human error is a leading cause of adverse events in anaesthesia. Residents' knowledge of how to respond to rare, yet potentially life-threatening events has been shown to deteriorate over time and thus cost-effective educational interventions are indicated. Previous research has shown that test-enhanced learning has the potential to strengthen both clinical knowledge and performance. We hypothesised that critical action procedures (CAPs) tests, similar to those employed by high-performance aircraft pilots, would help improve resident knowledge about how to respond to rare and potentially catastrophic events encountered during the perioperative period. Methods: Knowledge assessments were administered to 29 first-year anaesthesiology residents over the course of 9 months. Five-minute closed-book tests were administered with fill-in-the-blank questions regarding the American Society of Anesthesiologists' difficult airway guideline, advanced cardiac life support protocols, an institutional airway fire protocol and drug dosing for malignant hyperthermia. Inter-group comparisons were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The difference between the pre-test and final test scores for each subsection was determined with the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples. Results: Composite subtest scores, when compared with baseline pre-test scores and subsequent scores, and when adjusted for attrition, significantly improved over the course of 9 months (20.5% versus 80%; P ≤ 0.001). Likert-based survey data indicated a positive report for attainment of knowledge. Conclusions: In this longitudinal observational study of first-year anaesthesiology residents, CAPs testing helped improve knowledge about critical events. Although the study was limited by its small number of subjects, a significant attrition rate and the lack of a control group, it demonstrates a cost-effective educational intervention that improved resident knowledge. This intervention may enable residents to transfer learned skills from theoretical testing situations to real-life scenarios. We propose the use and further study of CAPs testing as a cost-effective modality to augment both simulated and actual experiential learning. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.</abstract>"", ""<title>Crisis management - Validation of an algorithm by analysis of 2000 incident reports</title> <abstract>Anaesthetists are called upon to manage complex life-threatening crises at a moment's notice. As there is evidence that this may require cognitive tasking beyond the information-processing capacity of the human brain, it was decided to try and develop a generic crisis management algorithm analogous to the 'Phase I' immediate response routine used by airline pilots. Such an algorithm, based on the mnemonic 'COVER ABCD, A SWIFT CHECK', was developed and refined over 3 meetings, each attended by 60-100 anaesthetists and aviation psychologists. It was validated against 1301 relevant incidents among the first 2000 incidents reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study. It proved sufficiently robust and safe to recommend its general use as an initial response to any incident or crisis which occurs when a patient is breathing gas from an anaesthetic machine. It requires a limited knowledge base and is easily learnt and rehearsed during the anaesthetist's working day. It will provide a functional diagnosis in over 99% of cases and will correct 62% of the problems in 40-60 seconds. In the remaining 37% it will allow the anaesthetist to proceed with a 'sub-algorithm' confident in the knowledge that some important step has not been missed. In just over 30% of incidents this will be for a problem familiar to all anaesthetists (e.g. laryngospasm, bradycardia); in just over 6% it will be for a less common, more complex, but finite, set of problems (3% cardiac arrest, 1% air embolism, 1% anaphylaxis, 1% for the remaining desaturations); in less than 1% diagnosis and correction will require a more complex checklist (e.g. for malignant hyperthermia, pneumothorax).

Introduction: Despite some progress, the air medical transport profession continues to experience widely publicized accidents that result in injuries and death to crew members and patients. An air medical crew member's experience, training and confidence may affect his or her ability to deal effectively with an in-flight emergency, and may also affect his or her behavior before and after the emergency. Setting: A hospital-based, rural rotor- and fixed-wing program flying approximately 890 flights per year. Seventy-seven percent of these flights are interfacility. Methods: A pretraining survey evaluated the experiences of air medical crew members and pilots. A 20-question assessment tool based on a 5-point Likert scale evaluated how confident the individuals were in their ability to react to in-flight emergencies. An extensive in-flight emergency training program was then conducted. Personnel were asked to complete the same questionnaire one month and six months after the training. Results: On the pretraining questionnaire, flight crew members with neither prior training nor actual experience in in-flight emergencies showed the lowest level of confidence. Those with prior training, actual in-flight emergency experience or both, responded with higher levels of confidence. The mean confidence scores of the study participants increased from 82 pretraining to 89 at one month post-training and remained at the increased level six months after training. Conclusions: A training program focusing on in-flight, aircraft-related emergencies can increase the crew's confidence during such situations. This increase in confidence is most noticeable in those without previous training or experience and is maintained for at least six months. Several other benefits occur from the training program. © 1994.</abstract>""]"

To date, speaking up has been studied mostly within teams. However, many high-risk organizations rely on the effective collaboration across teams in ad hoc multiteam systems (MTS). This study widens the scope of research from teams to MTS and empirically compares the mechanisms involved in speaking up within versus across teams in ad hoc MTS-aircrews. In a sample of 1490 aircrew members of a European airline, we found that crewmembers' individual level perceptions of psychological safety mediated both the relationship between status and speaking up and between perceived leader inclusiveness and speaking up within teams. Across teams, however, psychological safety and leader inclusiveness-as perceived by pursers in their role as boundary spanners-showed no effect. Instead, it was pursers' within-team perceptions of psychological safety that mediated between status and speaking up across teams. Teams in ad hoc MTS may thus serve as safe harbours supporting their members also in interactions across team boundaries. Implications of findings for research on MTS and practical recommendations to improve speaking up within and across teams in ad hoc MTS are discussed. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"", '<title>The effects of psychological safety and employee voice behavior on flight attendants’ mindful safety practices adoption</title> <abstract>Introduction: Flight attendants, as the front-line staff in the cabin, play a crucial role in improving air travel safety.

Trust is considered as a mechanism for facilitating the effects of a leader on employee citizenship behaviors. Increasingly research has focused on the role of trust in a safety context; however, the role of coworker trust has been overlooked. OBJECTIVES: The mediating role of coworker trust in the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior is the focus of this field study. METHODS: Front-line employees from an air traffic control center and an airline maintenance department completed surveys measuring leader-member exchange, co-worker trust, and safety citizenship behavior. RESULTS: Structural Equation Modeling revealed affective and cognitive trust in coworkers is influenced by leader-member exchange. A trust-based mediation model where cognitive trust and affective trust mediate the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior emerged. CONCLUSION: Results of this study add to our understanding of the relationship between leader-member exchange and safety behavior. The effect of co-worker trust and the extent to which employees participate in workplace safety practice were identified as critical factors. The findings show that managers need to focus on developing cognitive and affective coworker trust to improve safety citizenship behaviors. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.</abstract>', ""<title>Employee Silence and Psychological Safety: Insights from an Aviation Company with Broader Organizational Applications; Silêncio dos trabalhadores e segurança psicológica: Percepções de uma empresa de aviação com aplicações organizacionais mais amplas</title> <abstract>This study investigates the relationship between psychological safety and different types of silence — defensive, diffident, relational, ineffectual, and deviant — within the context of employee-supervisor interactions. Additionally, it examines the impact of sociodemographic variables on the manifestation of silence and its association with psychological safety. The research included 486 employees from a Portuguese aviation company. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods with SmartPLS. The results indicate a negative correlation between psychological safety and all types of silence, suggesting that psychologically safe work environments reduce employees' tendency to withhold concerns. Furthermore, significant effects of sex, education, and seniority were observed in the adoption of silence.

This paper explores the phenomenon of assaults against flight attendants through analysis of official data including both case files and statistics, interviews with officials, and a multidisciplinary literature review. Specifically, we identify factors related to both the etiology of, and reactions toward such behavior. Factors related to etiology include (1) the physical environment of an aircraft; (2) the juxtaposition of status roles between passenger and attendant; (3) the exercise of authority as a precipitating event; (4) the pervasiveness of sexual stereotypes; (5) the consumption of alcohol and drugs; and (6) psychological changes related to the experience of flying. In examining the responses to assaults we discuss (1) the statutory laws regarding aircraft assaults; (2) patterns in official statistics; (3) factors related to the underreporting of such incidents; (4) reactions by companies, unions, and the government, including the politics of deviance‐defining; and (5) changes in patterns of response.

This qualitative semi-structured interview study examined the perceived triggering factors and motivations for DPB and the subsequent impact of DPB upon cabin crew well-being and safety. Twenty-four European cabin crew disclosed experiences, subjective observations of perpetrator traits, assessment of DPB development and information regarding their well-being and perceived safety. Thematic analysis revealed that the perceived frequency of DPB had increased, driven by an accumulation of pandemic-related factors–such as enforcing mask wearing amongst intoxicated passengers. DPB was found to decrease resilience and spur maladaptive coping strategies in crew. Suggested enhancements to current\xa0DPB mitigation consisted of stricter punishment for DPB as a deterrent, alcohol bans and higher quality training. These findings can inform decision-makers’ efforts to support cabin crew well-being and create safer cabin workplaces in the future. © 2024 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

This case study emphasises the role of employees in delivering superior customer experience. This case study explores many facets of customer experience, reputation, social class membership and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Students will be able to apply theories of customer experience, behavioural psychology and service dimensions relevant to the airline industry. After completing this case study, students will be able to do the following:1. Evaluate the value of SOPs in Customer ManagementThis case study refers to the need for adhering to SOPs to deal with complex situations. Students will be able to evaluate whether compliance to SOPs could have helped Air India avoid the crisis or was it possible that a culture of absolute commitment to customer wellbeing could have prevented the crisis.2. Apply the theory of defensive attribution in customer grievance handling. Discuss if reducing customer effort in getting their problem solved can result in superior customer service.The victim had attributed the blame for not insisting on filing a complaint to the crew. Air India crew had defended their actions or lack of it by stating that they had followed the rule book. Students will be able to appreciate the need for a swift redressal mechanism to protect the self-image and self-esteem of the person/group involved. They will also understand that customer service interactions designed to solve customer problems swiftly and easily can be a very simple dictum to guide all employees in their decision-making while handling a customer complaint. 3. Evaluate the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer experience and examine the value of net promoter score (NPS) to study customer satisfaction. Air India Airlines was catering to varied customer groups such as the Indian diaspora, large student population pursuing education abroad, first-time flyers and the rising middle class with travel aspirations. Customer expectations vary across segments and change over their lifetime. Airline staff must trace customer corridors and deliver on customer expectation across the touch points that matter to them to ensure meaningful and relevant service delivery. Students will have an opportunity to evaluate the NPS in measuring customer satisfaction and debate whether it is a sufficient metric to guide the organisation on delivering and monitoring customer experience. 4. Examine why reputation risk management and not crisis management should be the focus of Air India in delivering superior customer service because nearly 70%–80% of market value for a company comes from its intangible assets such as brand equity and reputation. Students will discuss crisis management i.e. handling the threat to reputation after it has occurred and reputation risk management i.e. proactively managing potential threats to its reputation by taking timely actions to avoid or mitigate it. There are three factors (reputation reality gap, changing beliefs and expectation and weak internal coordination) that determine reputational risks. Students can evaluate this model to determine if Air India should address these three factors to manage its reputation proactively. Case overview/synopsis: This case study is set around an incident that happened on 26 November 2022, on Air India flight bound for Delhi from New York when an inebriated 34-year-old man had peed on a 72-year-old woman. The perpetrator of the crime had walked free, and the victim was left dissatisfied with how the cabin crew had handled her ordeal. Air India Airlines was launched in 1932 by industrialist JRD Tata and nationalised in 1953. In 2021, Tata Group acquired the 90-year-old Air India from the Government of India for $2.4bn (INR 18,000 crore) and appointed Campbell Wilson as chief executive officer and managing director. The incident brought to the fore the customer management issues that Wilson had to address. First on the list of Air India’s turnaround plan was delivering “exceptional customer experience”. How was it going to achieve it because the Indian aviation ecosystem lacked infrastructure such as airports, airspace, competition and customer preference-based services? There was also shortage of pilots, engineers, technicians, air-traffic controllers and technocrats to occupy positions within security agencies and regulatory bodies. With Air India’s acquisition, the Tata Group had to find innovative solutions to deal with decades of internal neglect, non-performance and labour union problems. This case study is relevant to address real issues of customer experience, consumer psychology, reputation risk management and standard operating procedures in service management. Complexity academic level: This case is suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate level students of business management. It can also be used for training service personnel of aviation industry. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

We demonstrate the relationship between voice parameters and cognitive performance in: 1) a task with psychological test character, and 2) performance in an operational, mission-relevant task. The central methodological aim was to verify the usefulness of voice commands and counting in providing anchor values for the step-function model of voice pitch. METHODS: During a 22-yr period, 42 cosmonauts participated in the Russian space experiment ""Pilot"", which was a hand-controlled docking maneuver. As reference the experiment included the cognitive task ""Manometer."" This task was controlled through voice commands. These voice commands were stored and are the basis for the present analysis. RESULTS: Cosmonauts differed in their working style and respective performance during the Manometer task. Clustered groups can be assumed to represent different effort. Importantly, these groups differed in the changes of voice pitch among mission phases and among task repetitions. However, there were no differences between these motivation groups and performance in the professional task. DISCUSSION: The differing effort is the effect of different motivation of cosmonauts for experimental test tasks vs. mission-relevant professional tasks. Latter ones provide a more reliable chance to assess the real actual state and skills of a cosmonaut.

Data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Analysis of variance, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and independent t-tests were used to assess the relationships between burnout and demographic and work-related factors. A structural equation model analysis was performed to assess the effect of burnout impact factors on mental health using the Brief Symptom Rating Scale, six common physical symptoms, and daytime dysfunction (a subscale of the Athens Insomnia Scale). The results showed a moderate level of burnout, as reported by 19.2 percent of the participants. Personal and work-related characteristics, including marital status and working hours, were not significantly associated with burnout. Smoking behavior was the only significant risk factor (T = −3.64). The impact model of burnout revealed a moderate direct effect of burnout on mental health symptoms (95 percent CI: 0.27, 0.47) and daytime dysfunction (95 percent CI: 0.04, 0.11) and a small direct effect on physical symptoms (95 percent CI: 0.28, 0.47). Our findings increase our understanding of the risk and impact factors related to burnout in female flight attendants. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The effect of cultural intelligence on burnout of Thai cabin crew in non-national airlines moderated by job tenure</title> <abstract>The job of cabin crew is considered to be a highly stressful job. In particular, cabin crew members who must deal with foreign passengers and a team of foreign coworkers are more prone to develop job burnout from their cross-cultural encounters. Therefore, having cross-cultural competence, which can help them to deal effectively with such situations, is crucial to preventing the problem of burnout. Cultural intelligence (CQ) was proposed in this research as a cross-cultural competence, essential for cabin crew members. The objective of the research was to examine the relationship between the CQ of the cabin crew members and the level of job burnout which they experience. Survey data were collected from a sample of 320 Thai cabin crew members, from seven non-Thai national airlines. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results supported the negative relationship between the CQ of cabin crew members and their job burnout. The moderating effect analysis also showed that the negative effect of CQ on burnout was particularly strong for cabin crew members with greater job tenure than those with lower job tenure. The results not only provide additional insight regarding the contribution of CQ to employee wellbeing in the airline industry, but also suggest some moderating conditions that could make CQ particularly essential for cabin crew members. Lastly, this research also provides recommendations for airline companies regarding interventions to prevent the psychological stress of their cabin crew. © 2020.</abstract>', '<title>Burnout and workplace deviance among flight attendants in Taiwan</title> <abstract>The relationship between burnout and workplace deviance, identified as a component of job performance, was examined. Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory which has three dimensions, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment. Workplace deviance was defined as voluntary behavior that violates significant organizational norms and threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both. This was assessed with the Workplace Deviance Scale, measuring the extent to which the participants had engaged in workplace deviant behavior such as taking property from work without permission, making fun of someone at work, or cursing at someone at work. Anonymous questionnaires with stamped envelopes were distributed to a sample of 1,470 Taiwanese flight attendants at the Arrival Hall of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. A response rate of 22.45% was obtained. After cases with missing data (n = 27) had been eliminated, the sample totaled 303, 17 men and 286 women. The average age was 28.7 yr. (SD = 4.6). Results of hierarchical regression showed that Depersonalization scores were significantly predictive of Workplace Deviance scores but not Emotional Exhaustion and Reduced Personal Accomplishment scores. Possible reasons and implications of these findings were discussed. © Psychological reports 2007.</abstract>']"

The results were summarized as follows. Eastward flights. Decrease of total sleep time, or increase of TST. Disturbances of intra-sleep cycles. Increase of slow wave sleep. Decrease of REM sleep in the amount. Prolonged REM sleep latency. Westward flights. Shortened sleep latency. Shortened REM sleep latency. Increase of percentage REM sleep. Unusual temporal distributions of REM sleep periods. Southward flight. No significant change. From all above mentioned it becomes evident that after transmeridian flight sleep rhythm is clearly disturbed. In this time we emphasized the changes in particular sleep rather than the overall changes in sleep-wake cycles. The changes in sleep pattern followed by time zone changes, however, are thought to result from a complicated summation of effects, such as sleep deprivation, sleep reversal, naps, shift in sleep onset time, and circadian rhythm alteration. The possible factors about the changes in sleep will be presented by Dr. Endo in the next lecture.</abstract>', '<title>The possible mechanisms of the disturbed circadian sleep-wake rhythm after time zone changes</title> <abstract>Changes in sleep after eastward flight. To go to bed at 2300 hr in SFO, which corresponds to 1600 hr in TYO, means that a traveller from TYO starts his sleep from evening nap in TYO. In evening naps, Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is increased and REM sleep is decreased. In the flight from West to East, however, the subjects experienced one night total sleep deprivation. Consequently, it is necessary to do research on naps after total sleep derivation. REM sleep is clearly increased in the morning and decreased in the evening in spite of one night total sleep deprivation. These findings indicate that the distribution of REM sleep is not affected by total sleep deprivation, but REM sleep has a clear circadian rhythm. By contrast, SWS is increased in the morning, afternoon and evening naps after total sleep deprivation. Thus, SWS is more independent of circadian effects and responsive to the length of prior wakefulness. From the findings mentioned above, it is assumed that the decrease of REM sleep and the increase of SWS in the first part of the sleep in SFO may be caused by effects of one night total sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm of REM sleep. Changes in sleep after westward flight. The sleep after returning home from east after the flight from TYO to LDN was different from that in baseline nights in TYO, with decreased REM sleep latency, appearance of SOREMs and increased REM sleep. Since the sleep after westward flight corresponds to that in the early morning to forenoon in the place before the flight, it is necessary to investigate the effect of sleep reversal and naps in daytime. In naps after one night total sleep deprivation, morning naps and had shortened REM sleep latency, increased REM sleep and frequent SOREMs. From the findings mentioned above, it is suggested that the nocturnal sleep after returning home from east and in LDN may reflect the circadian rhythm of sleep in the place before the start of the flight.</abstract>', '<title>Eastward long distance flights, sleep and wake patterns in air crews in connection with a two-day layover</title> <abstract>The present study describes the spontaneous sleep/wake pattern in connection with an eastward (Stockholm to Tokyo, +8 h) transmeridian flight and short (51 h) layovers. To describe all sleep episodes and the recovery process across 4 days, and to relate adjustment to individual differences, 49 Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) air crew were monitored for 9 days with activity monitors and sleep/wake diary before-during-after flight. The outbound flight involved a period of wakefulness extended to 21 h, frequently (87% of air crew) terminated by a long nap in Tokyo which was calm but difficult to wake up from. Then followed two night oriented sleep periods of normal length but of reduced efficiency, containing many and long awakenings. Napping was common during the extended periods of wakefulness, particularly during flights. During the recovery days, ease of rising from sleep in the mornings was difficult throughout, and feelings of not being refreshed returned to baseline levels on the third recovery sleep. Elevated daytime sleepiness (24% of the day) was observed on the first recovery day. No individual differences related to gender, age or position (cabin/pilot) was found in sleep strategy. Poor adjusters, subjects with a perceived lowered capacity on recovery days, showed more premature awakenings abroad and less refreshing sleep during the last 12 months, suggesting a decreased ability to cope with air crew scheduling. Comparisons with a westbound flight showed the eastbound flight layover sleep to be more problematic and containing more napping.</abstract>', '<title>Effects of sleep/wake history and circadian phase on proposed pilot fatigue safety performance indicators</title> <abstract>Summary: The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and Samn-Perelli fatigue ratings, and psychomotor vigilance task performance are proposed as measures for monitoring commercial pilot fatigue. In laboratory studies, they are sensitive to sleep/wake history and circadian phase. The present analyses examined whether they reliably reflect sleep/wake history and circadian phase during transmeridian flight operations. Data were combined from four studies (237 pilots, 730 out-and-back flights between 13 city pairs, 1-3-day layovers). Sleep was monitored (wrist actigraphy, logbooks) before, during and after trips. On duty days, sleepiness, fatigue and mean response speed were measured pre-flight and at the top of the descent. Mixed-model analysis of variance examined associations between these measures and sleep/wake history, after controlling for operational factors. Circadian phase was approximated by local (domicile) time in the city where each trip began and ended. More sleep in the 24\xa0h prior to duty was associated with lower pre-flight sleepiness and fatigue and faster response speed. Sleepiness and fatigue were greater before flights departing during the domicile night and early morning. At the top of the descent, pilots felt less sleepy and fatigued after more in-flight sleep and less time awake. Flights arriving in the early-mid-morning (domicile time) had greater sleepiness and fatigue and slower response speeds than flights arriving later. Subjective ratings showed expected associations with sleep/wake history and circadian phase. The response speed showed expected circadian variation but was not associated with sleep/wake history at the top of the descent. This may reflect moderate levels of fatigue at this time and/or atypically fast responses among pilots. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society.</abstract>', ""<title>Circadian adaptation of airline pilots during extended duration operations between the USA and Asia</title> <abstract>This study tracked circadian adaptation among airline pilots before, during, and after trips where they flew from Seattle (SEA) or Los Angeles (LAX) to Asia (7-9 time zones westward), spent 7-12d in Asia, and then flew back to the USA. In Asia, pilots' exposures to local time cues and sleep opportunities were constrained by duty (short-haul flights crossing 1 time zone/24h). Fourteen captains and 16 first officers participated (median age=56 versus 48 yrs, p.U)<0.001). Their sleep was monitored (actigraphy, duty/sleep diaries) from 3d pre-trip to 5d post-trip. For every flight, Karolinska Sleepiness and Samn-Perelli Fatigue scales and 5-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) tests were completed pre-flight and at top of descent (TOD). Participants had 3 d free of duty prior to outbound flight(s). From 72-24h prior to departure (baseline sleep), mean total sleep/24h (TST)=7.00h (SD=1.18h) and mean sleep efficiency=87% (SD=4.9%). Most pilots (23/30) flew direct to and from Asia, but 7 LAX-based pilots flew via a 1-d layover in Honolulu (HNL). On flights with 2 pilots, mean total in-flight sleep varied from 0.40 to 2.09h outbound and from 0.74 to 1.88h inbound. Duty patterns in Asia were variable, with 2 flights/d (mean flight duration=3.53h, SD=0.53h). TST on days 1Â-7 in Asia did not differ from baseline (p.F)=0.2031). However, mean sleep efficiency was significantly lower than baseline on days 5-7 (p.F)=0.0041). More pilots were on duty between 20:00 and 24:00h on days 5Â-7 (mean=21%) than on days 2Â-4 (mean=14%). Sleep propensity distribution phase markers and chi-square periodogram analyses suggest that adaptation to local time was complete by day 4 in Asia. On pre-flight PVT tests in Asia, the slowest 10% of responses improved for flights departing 14:00-19:59h (p.F)=0.0484). At TOD, the slowest 10% of responses improved across days for flights arriving 14:00-19:59h (p.F)=0.0349) and 20:00-01:59h (p.F)=0.0379). Sleepiness and fatigue ratings pre-flight and at TOD did not change across days in Asia. TST on post-trip day 1 was longer than baseline (estimated mean extension=1.68h; adjusted p(t)<0.0001). On all post-trip days, sleep efficiency was comparable to baseline. Sleep propensity distribution phase markers and chi-square periodogram analyses suggest complete readaptation in 1Â-2d. Two opposing influences appeared to affect sleep and PVT performance across days in Asia: progressive circadian adaptation to local time and increasing duty during local night, which displaced sleep from the optimal physiological time. Cumulative sleep restriction across the return flight may explain the large rebound in TST on day 1 post-trip. Thereafter TST, sleep efficiency, and sleep timing suggest that readaptation was complete. Rapid post-trip readaptation may be facilitated by pilots having unconstrained nocturnal sleep opportunities, coupled with stronger patterns of family and social cues than in Asia. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.</abstract>""]"

This section is not mandatory. The specific professions of aviation personnel include the professions of the pilot and air traffic controller. These occupations are specific in that while performing their work, they must be able to simultaneously operate the devices in the handling area and in the pedipulation area, supplemented by acoustic sensations in the form of correspondence between flying and ground stations. The performance requirements of pilots and air traffic controllers place high demands on their health, psychological condition, attention, and concentration, due to being in constant pursuit of minimization of erroneous decisions, otherwise defined as the human factor in aviation. This article is focused on the development and testing of a technical device for measuring the relative error rate of students in multitasking tasks in preparation for employment. The main result is a designed technical device with hardware (HW) and software (SW) parts. An experimental method was used to measure the qualitative and quantitative performance indicators of the test subjects. The results of the experiment were observed and evaluated based on the analytical-synthetic method based on critical thinking. By comparing and abstracting the measured data, the reference values of the performance indicators of the tested subjects were determined. The selection of the final sample of subjects consisted of two phases. In the first phase, questionnaires were evaluated, and in the second phase, reaction time measurements during multitasking tasks using technical equipment were evaluated. Based on the measurements, an error ratio was defined, which could be graphically represented. The testing proved the full functionality of the designed technical equipment for these purposes in aviation education. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>', ""<title>Preliminary examination of timesharing in United States Air Force rotc cadets</title> <abstract>Previous research has shown that timesharing ability-the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously-is related to various indices of aircraft pilots' proficiency.

Background: The perceptual-cognitive abilities required for MOT are also important for ATC performance. The current study provides a novel examination of NeuroTracker’s utility to predict novice performance on a simulated ATC task, relative to two discrete measures of working memory (WM). Method: Forty-six participants completed computer-based assessments of MOT ability (NeuroTracker) and WM (Corsi Block Tapping, Automated Operation Span) followed by the simulated ATC task. Regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between ATC task performance and the MOT and WM measures. Results: After controlling for age and video game playing, MOT ability significantly predicted more correct detections of conflicts between aircraft, fewer false alarm responses to conflicts, and faster aircraft acceptance and hand-off. When WM measures were included in regressions, MOT was a stronger predictor of performance than WM on those outcomes, and remained a statistically significant predictor of better conflict detection, false alarm response, and hand-off performance. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the relevance of MOT ability to ATC task performance and support the potential utility of NeuroTracker for controller applicant screening and selection.

Data from work samples, in which technicians verbally isolated simulated equipment failures, were collected from both groups before and after the training. The work sample data were then examined by subject matter experts who scored performance for overall proficiency and noted specific violations of good troubleshooting practice. These violations provided the basis for the components of performance examined in the work sample data. The results of this componential analysis allow more specific conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the training intervention by revealing how the tutoring system improved technicians' troubleshooting (e.g., tutored technicians were more likely than untutored technicians to test components thoroughly to ensure they were faulty before replacing them).</abstract>""]"

Plasma catecholamines showed significant increases only at 0.25 and 0.50 h, returning to control levels between 1.0-24 h; blood lactate paralleled the catecholamines' response. Plasma free glycerol showed a significant and sustained decrease during the first 24 h.

Diaphragm muscle glycogen was significantly decreased at 1.0 h, but showed a significant increase at 24 h. The isolated diaphragm muscle tissues from these rats were also studied in vitro to determine insulin effect on glucose uptake. Muscle tissues obtained from noncentrifuged controls and incubated with insulin (0.3 mU·ml-1) in the medium showed significant increases in glucose uptake; in contrast, muscle tissues from centrifuged rats showed no insulin effect on glucose uptake. It is concluded that the initial, rapid rise in blood glucose of rats exposed to hyper-G stress is mediated by increases in circulating catecholamines and glucagon, both potent stimulators of hepatic gluconeogenesis; and that the sustained hyperglycemia may be due in part to the inhibition of the insulin-stimulated uptake by muscle tissues.</abstract>"", ""<title>Changes in stress hormones and metabolism during a 105-day simulated Mars mission</title> <abstract>Background: The Mars-105 project was aimed at simulating crew ' s activities, workload, and communication during a mission to Mars, evaluating the homeostatic adaptations to prolonged confinement and cohabitation. Methods: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin, C-peptide, leptin, cortisol, and NGF and BDNF plasma levels were monitored in six healthy nonsmoking male subjects taking part in a 105-d Mars mission simulation. Samples were collected from each subject before (0 wk), during (2.5 wk; 5 wk; 10 wk; 15 wk), and after confinement (+1 wk). Results: Confinement resulted in impaired glucometabolic parameters, since FPG increased during the first 5 wk (baseline: 85.2 ± 10.8 mg · dl-1; 2.5 wk: 98.4 ± 4.7 mg · dl-1; 5 wk: 92.5 ± 6.0 mg · dl-1) and insulin dropped at 2.5 wk (baseline: 14.4 ± 4.8 mU · L-1; 2.5 wk: 7.7 ± 2.1 mU · L-1), subsequently returning to baseline values. HOMA-IR paralleled plasma insulin, dropping to 1.8 ± 0.5 at 2.5 wk (baseline: 3.0 ± 1.2).

These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6\xa0g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2\xa0days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment. © © 2024 Ouchi, Kono, Satou, Kurashima, Yamaguchi, Kimura and Shibukawa.</abstract>', '<title>Facial Expression Perception and Psychological Changes During Space Analogs</title> <abstract>Facial expression perception is the process by which someone can interpret the emotion of another individual using their facial cues. Below-average scores on tests designed to measure facial expression recognition (FER) accuracies are associated with inappropriate behavioral responses and are often linked to mental or neurological disorders. Head-down bed rest microgravity analog studies show changes in facial emotion processing that may indicate a behavioral health risk during spaceflight. METHODS: During short-duration space analog missions at two separate facilities, 15 subjects took daily FER tests before, during, and after the mission. Each test was accompanied by questionnaires measuring either potential causal or impacted variables: stress, depression, loneliness, irritability, risk-taking, empathy, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS: Analysis of variance and post hoc t-tests showed that during the mission, the subjects were less likely to identify angry, sad, or fearful faces as disgusted compared to the baseline. Also, interest/enjoyment and perceived competence increased throughout the mission lifecycle. Multiple regression analyses were able to account for greater than 20% of the variance for depression and health/safety risk-taking using the FER data. DISCUSSION: Changes in FER during space mission simulations show that perception changes are not limited to microgravity analogs. A perceptual change was observed during the short-duration missions, but there is not sufficient evidence to show behavioral health impacts. However, associations between FER and the questionnaires show a potential to develop predictive models, countermeasures, or psychological monitoring tools using FER. Additional research is required to determine the efficacy of such tools during long-duration spaceflight. © (2024), (Aerospace Medical Association).

However, studies in space or in space-analog environments struggle to find a consensus on the affective impact of these stressors. Also, there is a lack of research using multiple measures to assess affective states in these conditions (e.g., positive and negative measures and physiological parameters). More research is needed to understand the psycho-physiological mechanisms during long-duration space-like missions. Our study was conducted during a space-analog confinement (SIRIUS-19). Throughout the mission, we assessed variations of affective states using subjective and physiological parameters. We expected interindividual variability, with transitory and chronic changes on the psychological and physiological dimensions of affective states. METHODS: Six subjects (three men/three women; four Russians/two Americans; age = 33.83 ± 6.37) performed the protocol once a month during the 4-mo confinement. Subjects completed various psychometric scales about their affective states (Self-Assessment Manikin, Positive and Negative Affective Schedule) and provided hair cortisol samples. Due to the small sample size, only individual values and descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Psychometric measures remained positive and stable. Hair cortisol levels increased at the beginning of the mission (from 31.79 ± 18.05 pg · mg−1 to 62.25 ± 31.99 pg · mg−1). Most of the measurements showed interindividual variability. DISCUSSION: T he subjective affective states remained positive and relatively stable throughout the mission. The initial increase of hair cortisol is attributed to an adaptation phase of the crew. No affective variation seems to be related to this phase. Our results indicate effective affective adaptation to the confinement. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

(''DSM-III''). A total of 117 astronaut applicants underwent this clinical interview as part of a comprehensive medical evaluation during a recent astronaut selection. Of the 117 applicants, 9 (7.7%) met DSM-III criteria for a variety of Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, including V-code diagnoses.</abstract>"", ""<title>The evolution and present status of mental health standards for selection of USAF candidates for space missions</title> <abstract>The mental health evaluation of the original Mercury astronauts was a prolonged, meticulous, research-oriented process involving testing and interviews to determine who was best qualified for space flight. The trend since then has been to simplify this evaluation, making it more subjective and clinically oriented. The goal is to identify candidates who are fully qualified, free of psychopathology, and who have a healthy motivation for space flight. The selection of nonpilots for duty as payload specialists introduces new factors - lack of previous exposure to dangerous situations, possible impact of new stresses on the family situation, and interrelationships between crew members. These factors can be included in determination of individual candidates as being 'fully qualified,' rather than returning to the original 'best qualified' standards, and affirmative qualities may be identified which mark candidates as 'exceptionally well qualified.'

The final stage involved 10 of 963 applicants undergoing the first and second examination stages based on physical checks, written tests, and interviews. The third (final) stage focused on evaluating the behavioral attitudes required for ISS crewmembers. Since it is difficult to assess these attitudes by paper testing or interview alone, JAXA has established an environment in which the assessors could observe the behavior of examinees on a continuous basis. Methods: The 10 examinees stayed in the isolation and confinement facility for 1 wk. During their stay, several group and personal tasks were assigned along with predetermined daily schedules covering aspects of leadership, teamwork ability, productivity (performance), and so on. Subsequently, psychologists, psychiatrists, and JAXA officials/managers experienced in practical human space development evaluated them. Results: During the confinement, no examinees showed any excessive character traits or psychopathologic behavior. Repeated observations led to a convergence of opinions among the experts. Three examinees ultimately passed this assessment and were assigned as new Japanese astronaut candidates. Discussion: This unique assessment enabled the assessors to conduct longitudinal evaluations, evaluations based on observing detailed behavior, and easy control of test conditions and safety. Although "" selection of the right stuff "" may differ among each space agency, this method offers the unique advantage of allowing experts in various fields to evaluate the competencies of examinees both synthetically and longitudinally. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

Following obesity, alcohol consumption was consistently the second-best predictor of blood pressure. Alcohol intake rose among those subjects who developed sustained elevated blood pressure during the course of the study. Further, obesity became less important in predicting blood pressure at higher levels of alcohol intake.

The reasons for this are unclear. The purpose of this research was to develop a theory as to why this program is successful. METHODS: A qualitative examination following grounded theory methodology was undertaken. AOD program patients and healthcare professionals were interviewed until content saturation was reached. Data analysis followed grounded theory to identify the key concepts associated with the program’s success. RESULTS: T he core theory that emerged highlighted the pivotal roles of a strong employee–company relationship, shared values, and a safety-focused culture in explicating the program’s success. This moves beyond the “carrot and stick” model of motivation, where belonging to this organization and safety consciousness serve as powerful drivers for abstinence. Challenges and barriers highlighted some unique challenges to the program in managing the coronavirus pandemic and the difference in approach to substance use in community spaces versus safety-critical employment. DISCUSSION: T his research expands the understanding of this AOD program’s success in a safety-critical industry, emphasizing the elements of a working relationship that are beyond positive or negative reinforcement.

The common goal for both studies was to achieve visual meteorological capacity under instrument meteorological conditions, when landing aircraft on parallel runways 750 ft apart. Using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, both studies investigated procedures related to breakout maneuvers on final approach during off-nominal conditions. The first study investigated procedures for 2 parallel runways (involving a leading and trailing aircraft) and the second study examined 3 parallel runways separated by 750 ft, investigating procedures for 3 simultaneously arriving aircraft (leading, center, and right aircraft). In both studies, off-nominal events were introduced during the approach. In some cases the wake of the leading aircraft drifted too close to the aircraft behind. In others, the leading aircraft deviated off its course and blundered toward the trailing aircraft. Statistical analysis examined the effects of approach echelon (2-runway vs. 3-runway), breakout cause, and breakout location on the dependent measures of breakout trajectory cross-track error, breakout trajectory track angle error, pilot workload, and pilot situation awareness. Although revealing differences between the study conditions, results also show accurate cross-track and track angle error levels (i.e., high levels of breakout trajectory accuracy), manageable pilot workload, and high levels of pilot situation awareness across all conditions in both studies.

A trajectory planned prior to takeoff, might, however, require in-flight revision. To support the flight crew in their task of accurately replanning a flight plan up to a metering fix, in 4 dimensions, a dedicated planning interface has been designed, adopting a cognitive systems engineering approach. The interface allows direct manipulation of the ground track and the descent profile. Constraints on trajectory planning are mapped onto alternative waypoint locations, highlighting the possibilities for acceptable ground track geometry in the horizontal situation display. In the vertical situation display, these constraints are mapped onto candidate top- and bottom-of-descent locations. It is hypothesized that the designed interface enables pilots to efficiently plan suitable 4D trajectories, while allowing for adaptive behavior and supporting situation awareness, even under high workload conditions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Design Factors of Guiding Aircraft Through Continuous Descent Operations: Pilot and Controller Perspectives</title> <abstract>Objective: This survey identifies the design factors needed to guide aircraft through continuous descent operation (CDO) procedures.

Method: One hundred and twenty surveys were distributed and 61 pilots and 49 controllers responded. Eight pilots and 25 controllers had experience implementing CDOs. Results: All respondents ranked altitude control as the most important design factor. Pilots with CDO experience preferred to reduce the frequency of communication in the procedure, whereas experienced controllers expected to know the approach path as early as possible.

A problem with decelerating approaches, however, is that they typically lead to increased spacing, which in turn results in a significant reduction of runway landing capacity. A possible solution to this problem might be to delegate the task of separating the aircraft during the approach to the pilot. To aid the pilot, an algorithm has been developed that predicts the trajectory of the preceding aircraft and optimizes the flap schedule based on this prediction. Offline simulations indicate that using this system runway throughput numbers of up to 98% of the capacity of a conventional instrument landing system (ILS) approach can be achieved (Ren & Clarke, 2003). To assess practical implementation issues and to investigate pilot appreciation, a piloted experiment was conducted, for which a pilot support interface has been developed that presents the future separation information in an intuitive fashion. The experiment showed that it is indeed possible for pilots to perform the spacing task while flying a TDDA. The pilot support interface significantly reduces pilot workload when compared to a baseline display. Also the effects of off-nominal lead pilot behavior on pilot performance are reduced by the use of online flap schedule optimization and separation prediction. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

In addition, there is scattered epidemiologic evidence and considerable clinical support that disturbed or inadequate sleep may be a risk factor for clinical emergence of cardiovascular disease and for total mortality. The role of sleep problems both as a precursor and as a sequela of disease states could be better delineated in large groups by the availability of a brief, reliable and standardized scale for sleep disturbance. Such a scale could also be used to evaluate the impact of different therapies upon sleep problems. This paper presents data from two study populations responding to three and four item self-report scales.

This study aimed to explore the effects of sleep problems on depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese commercial pilots. Methods: Adults who participated in the baseline assessment of the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China between December 2022 and March 2023 formed the study sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed using standardized scales. Sleep duration was measured with standardized questions. Logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to analyze the association between sleep problems and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 7055 pilots were included in this study. The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety among pilots was 23.3% (n = 1642; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.3%–24.3%) and 17.0% (n = 1196; 95% CI = 16.1–17.8%), respectively. Logistic regression analyses revealed that short sleep duration (<7 h) was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.491; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 2.555; p < 0.001), while poor sleep quality was also associated with a higher risk of depression (OR = 7.297; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 7.469; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, there was an inverse, J-shaped nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and both depression (inflection point: 7.64 h) and anxiety (inflection point: 7.48 h). Similarly, a J-shaped nonlinear relationship was found between sleep quality and depression/anxiety with an inflection point of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) = 4 points for both. The major limitation of the study was that causal relationships between variables could not be inferred due to the cross-sectional study design. Conclusion: This study found that depression and anxiety were common among Chinese commercial pilots. Insufficient length and poor quality of sleep were associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Implementing targeted strategies to improve sleep patterns is crucial for reducing the risk of depression and anxiety in this population. © © 2024 Pan Chen et al.</abstract>', '<title>Dietary Rhythmicity and Mental Health Among Airline Personnel</title> <abstract>IMPORTANCE Misaligned dietary rhythmicity has been associated with metabolic diseases; however, its association with mental health remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between dietary rhythms and the mental health condition of shift workers, specifically airline crew members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected from the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China, an ongoing large-scale health survey of pilots, flight attendants, and air security officers employed by major airline companies in China. Participants aged 18 to 60 years were invited through text messages to complete a web-based survey. The data collection period was December 2022 to March 2023. Statistical analysis was performed from July 24, 2023, to April 12, 2024. EXPOSURE Data on timing of breakfast and dinner on workdays and rest days, daily time windows for food intake, and meal and eating jet lags were collected and calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the associations of anxiety and depression with meal timing, eating window time, meal jet lag (ie, delayed meals), and eating jet lag (ie, delayed eating). All models were adjusted for individual socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS Of the 22 617 participants (median [IQR] age, 29.1 [26.3-33.7] years; 13 712 males [60.6%]), 1755 (7.8%) had anxiety and 2768 (12.2%) had depression. After controlling for confounding factors, having dinner after 8 PM on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.05) and depression (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.78-2.27), compared with consuming dinner before 8 PM. Similar results were observed on night-shift days and rest days. An eating window of less than 12 hours was associated with reduced odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) and depression (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89) on morning-shift days; the results remained significant on rest days. Delayed dinner on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54) and depression (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). On night-shift days, delayed dinner was associated with higher odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and depression (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36). On morning-shift days, delayed eating rhythms were associated with higher odds of depression (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.61), whereas advanced eating rhythms were associated with lower odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that meal timing, long eating window, and meal jet lags were associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the need for interventions and supportive policies that help mitigate the adverse implications of shift work and irregular working hours for the mental health of shift workers. © 2024 American Medical Association.

Improper medication can not only affect the physical and mental health of the pilots but can also endanger flight safety. Hence, we aimed to quickly and effectively relieve symptoms and restore cognitive function by forming a consensus of Chinese experts on the pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in pilots using the Delphi method. Methods: Relevant literature was searched to enumerate the current status of pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in pilots, followed by two rounds of expert consultation and discussion according to the listed status of the survey using the Delphi method. A descriptive statistical method was used to analyze the basic information, authority coefficients, concentration of opinions, and survey items of the experts to develop a consensus on the pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in pilots. Results: A total of 16 experts in psychiatry, pharmacology, and aerospace medicine from different provinces and cities across China were invited for consultation. The recovery rate of the two rounds of consultation was 100%, and the expert authority coefficients were 0.897 and 0.906, respectively. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance of indicators at all levels was 0.564–0.594 (p < 0.01). Based on the number of votes received, alprazolam tablets (16), eszopiclone tablets (15), and lorazepam tablets (14) were recommended for the treatment of excitatory psychomotor symptoms of acute stress disorder; paroxetine tablets (15) and sertraline tablets (15) were available for psychomotor depressive symptoms; olanzapine tablets (15), olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets (14), and quetiapine fumarate tablets (14) were selected for psychotic symptoms.

The study assesses the risk factors for sleep quality of airline pilots in Serbia with the objective of determining those factors, both occupational and lifestyle that are paramount in assisting with sleep health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 66 Serbian commercial pilots, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess their sleep quality. Demographic, occupational, lifestyle, biological and psychological variables were obtained through validated questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥5). Results: Overall sleep quality was poor in 65.2% of the participants. Significant factors associated with poor sleep quality included years of experience (OR\u202f=\u202f1.17, p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and levels of stress (OR\u202f=\u202f2.87, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Particular lifestyle variables, including factors such as coffee intake, had initial relationships with sleep quality but were not significant in the multivariate models. With regard to age, a significant univariate association was also revealed but was dropped in the final model because of collinearity with years of experience. Conclusion: Serbian commercial pilots have a relatively high risk of inadequate sleep associated with years of experience and levels of stress. There is a need to implement organization-wide changes such as stress management schemes in order to improve sleep quality among pilots, and foster prioritizing well-being. © © 2025 Stojanović, Nesic, Maksimović, Terzić-Šupić, Todorović, Topalović, Vlaisavljević and Ilić Živojinović.</abstract>']"

Although a significant problem, design specifications for alleviation of simulator sickness have not yet been produced. The problems researchers face in this area are multiple: (a) Simulator sickness is polygenic, rendering experimental isolation of variables ineffective; (b) simulator sickness is polysymptomatic, which must be reflected in measurements of the human response; and (c) there are statistical limitations including limited sample sizes, adaptation over flights, small effect sizes, and large individual differences. These problems render certain research and engineering strategies more effective than others. Our conclusions, based on analysis of a large data base (more than 2,000 exposures in military simulators) and statistical power calculations, suggest that improved simulator-design criteria can best be studied in “field experiments” in which large sample sizes permit the relatively small effects of several different simulator-equipment features to be isolated, contrasted, and revealed. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The success or failure of high-G training could be multifactorial, but most previous studies have only focused on the effect of pilots' physical condition. METHODS: A total of 138 male trainee pilots participated in this study. All trainee pilots had received AGSM training from experienced instructors and then underwent centrifuge high-G training. Participants completed questionnaire surveys about body size, lifestyle, self-reported AGSM proficiency, resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC), and depression level (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). RESULTS: Of the 138 subjects, 100 (72.5%) successfully completed high-G training without experiencing G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) within two trials; these were allocated to the success group. The remaining 38 (27.5%) subjects who completed the training after three or more attempts, or who failed to complete the training at all, were allocated to the failure group. Multivariate analyses revealed that the success of centrifuge training was positively associated with age and self-reported AGSM proficiency, and negatively associated with depression level. DISCUSSION: The success of high-G training was significantly associated with self-reported AGSM proficiency and depression level.

This study evaluated whether electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback enhances muscle activation patterns during AGSM training in novice cadets. METHODS: There were 58 Brazilian Air Force cadets (age: 25\u202f±\u202f1 yr) who performed two AGSM sessions involving sustained submaximal isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, and rectus abdominis muscles, synchronized with rhythmic breathing every 3 s. Subjects completed trials under counterbalanced visual EMG feedback conditions (real-time visualization vs. no visualization) and were randomly assigned to verbal feedback conditions (instructor guidance vs. no guidance). EMG signals were recorded at 1500\u202fHz and normalized to each subject's peak amplitude during the AGSM trials. RESULTS: Muscle-specific responses to feedback were observed. Verbal feedback enhanced gastrocnemius activation but reduced vastus medialis activation. Combined visual and verbal feedback produced the highest activation in the rectus abdominis. Visual feedback alone had minimal effect across all muscles. Despite submaximal instructions, brief peak activations were sufficient for normalization. DISCUSSION: EMG biofeedback facilitated motor learning of AGSM by selectively improving activation in targeted muscles.

Human Centrifuge Systems (HCSs) provide an effective G-acceleration training tool to prepare and increase the G-tolerance of aircrew. Though highly capable HCSs are available, they are yet to be fully optimised to accurately and reliably recreate the G-vectors produced by ACMs. Optimisation steps to achieve this improvement involve the configurational structure, motion capability, and motion control of HCSs. To improve the motion capability and control of HCSs, the relationship between aircraft G-vectors and HCS G-vectors should be profoundly investigated. This work analyses the G-vectors of common ACMs and the corresponding G-vectors as well as kinematics of an active four Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) HCS. The mathematical models of an aircraft and HCS kinematics are developed using rigid body equations of motion through Newton-Euler method. The relationship between aircraft G-vectors and HCS G-vectors is established using inverse kinematics with an optimal solver. The outcomes of this study show that an active four-DoF HCS with gondola roll, pitch, and yaw rotation can replicate the G-vectors of common ACMs with small discrepancies. The largest error between the reference and achieved G-vectors occurred along the local z-axis of the HCS gondola during the transition of roll, pitch, and yaw motions of the gondola to the required angle replicating the G-vectors of the ACMs. The tracing errors are not significant; hence they can be mitigated with an optimal control technique. The presented outcomes will provide an essential step in identifying the optimal design and refined requirements for an HCS to efficiently replicate aircraft G-vectors. The applied methodology is easily adaptable to HCS with different structures and DoFs. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract>', '<title>Subject anxiety and psychological considerations for centrifuge-simulated suborbital spaceflight</title> <abstract>Introduction: Anxiety and psychological concerns may pose a challenge to future commercial spaceflight. To help identify potential measures of anxiousness and indicators of flight-related stress, the psychiatric histories and anxiousness responses of volunteers exposed to G forces in centrifuge-simulated spaceflight acceleration profiles were examined. Methods: Over 2 d, 86 individuals (63 men, 23 women), 20-78 yr old, underwent up to 7 centrifuge runs. Day 1 consisted of two +G<inf>z</inf> runs (peak = +3.5 G<inf>z</inf>) and two +G<inf>x</inf> runs (peak = +6.0 G<inf>x</inf>). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G<inf>x</inf> and +G<inf>z</inf>). Hemodynamic data were collected during the profiles. Subjects completed a retrospective self-report anxiety questionnaire. Medical monitors identified individuals exhibiting varying degrees of anxiousness during centrifuge exposure, medical histories of psychiatric disease, and other potential indicators of psychological intolerance of spaceflight. Results: The retrospective survey identified 18 individuals self-reporting anxiousness, commonly related to unfamiliarity with centrifuge acceleration and concerns regarding medical history. There were 12 individuals (5 men, 7 women, average age 46.2 yr) who were observed to have anxiety that interfered with their ability to complete training; of these, 4 reported anxiousness on their questionnaire and 9 ultimately completed the centrifuge profiles. Psychiatric history was not significantly associated with anxious symptoms. Discussion: Anxiety is likely to be a relevant and potentially disabling problem for commercial spaceflight participants; however, positive psychiatric history and self-reported symptoms did not predict anxiety during centrifuge performance. Symptoms of anxiousness can often be ameliorated through training and coaching. Even highly anxious individuals are likely capable of tolerating commercial spaceflight. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>The effects of training on anxiety and task performance in simulated suborbital spaceflight</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: In commercial spaceflight, anxiety could become mission-impacting, causing negative experiences or endangering the flight itself. We studied layperson response to four varied-length training programs (ranging from 1 h-2 d of preparation) prior to centrifuge simulation of launch and re-entry acceleration profiles expected during suborbital spaceflight. We examined subject task execution, evaluating performance in high-stress conditions. We sought to identify any trends in demographics, hemodynamics, or similar factors in subjects with the highest anxiety or poorest tolerance of the experience. METHODS: Volunteers participated in one of four centrifuge training programs of varied complexity and duration, culminating in two simulated suborbital spaceflights. At most, subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d, including two +G<inf>z</inf> runs (peak +3.5 G<inf>z</inf>, Run 2) and two +G<inf>x</inf> runs (peak +6.0 G<inf>x</inf>, Run 4) followed by three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G<inf>x</inf> and +G<inf>z</inf>, peak +6.0 G<inf>x</inf> and +4.0 G<inf>z</inf>). Two cohorts also received dedicated anxietymitigation training. Subjects were evaluated on their performance on various tasks, including a simulated emergency. RESULTS: Participating in 2-7 centrifuge exposures were 148 subjects (105 men, 43 women, age range 19-72 yr, mean 39.4 ± 13.2 yr, body mass index range 17.3-38.1, mean 25.1 ± 3.7). There were 10 subjects who withdrew or limited their G exposure; history of motion sickness was associated with opting out. Shorter length training programs were associated with elevated hemodynamic responses. Single-directional G training did not significantly improve tolerance. DISCUSSION: Training programs appear best when high fidelity and sequential exposures may improve tolerance of physical/ psychological flight stressors. The studied variables did not predict anxiety-related responses to these centrifuge profiles. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

An initial 51-item test was constructed in which each item described an in-flight situation that required a decision on the part of the pilot and 4 alternative solutions to the situation. Subject matter experts were used to generate a scoring key from the alternatives that the experts recommended for a typical GA pilot. In Study 1, the test was administered in paper-and-pencil format to 246 participants. Results from that first study showed that the test had acceptable psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency and distribution. In Study 2, the test was administered to 467 participants over the Internet. Analyses resulted in the reduction of the test to 39 items, with an internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of .747. Construct validation was accomplished through correlation with a measure of the number of times the participant had been involved in an accident or other hazardous aviation event. Pilots who had higher (better) scores on the SJT were found to have experienced fewer hazardous events, which was taken as supporting the construct validity of the test. Evaluation of mode of administration (paper-and-pencil vs. Internet) showed that the 2 forms were equivalent. These results suggest that the SJT has potential for use in the assessment of judgment or aeronautical decision making by GA pilots, and might be useful in the evaluation of training. The implications of the findings, regarding equivalence of the 2 administration formats, are discussed.</abstract>', '<title>A simulator-based approach to training in aeronautical decision making</title> <abstract>The effectiveness of a simulator-based approach to training pilot skills in risk assessment and decision making was evaluated in a sample of pilots enrolled in a university aviation science program.

The mental health of airline pilots plays a significant role in their occupational health and overall performance. It is also vital for ensuring the safe operation of aircrafts. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that may improve the mental health of pilots. This study investigates the relationship between proactive coping, perceived stress, social support, and mental health among airline pilots during China's regular prevention and control of COVID-19. Using a sample consisting of 285 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model to explore whether, how, and when proactive coping affects the mental health of pilots. The results show that proactive coping has a direct and positive effect on pilots' mental health, as well as an indirect effect on mental health through its influence on perceived stress. Social support was found to weaken the relationship between perceived stress and mental health. It also weakened the indirect relationship between proactive coping and mental health through perceived stress. These findings advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that affect the mental health of pilots.

Although pilots’ physical and mental health problems have become increasingly prominent, their health has not been taken seriously. This study aimed to clarify challenges and support needs related to psychological and physical health among pilots to inform development of a more scientific and comprehensive physical and mental health system for civil aviation pilots. Methods: This qualitative study recruited pilots from nine civil aviation companies. Focus group interviews via an online conference platform were conducted in August 2022. Colaizzi analysis was used to derive themes from the data and explore pilots’ experiences, challenges, and support needs. Results: The main sub-themes capturing pilots’ psychological and physical health challenges were: (1) imbalance between family life and work; (2) pressure from assessment and physical examination eligibility requirements; (3) pressure from worries about being infected with COVID-19; (4) nutrition deficiency during working hours; (5) changes in eating habits because of the COVID-19 pandemic; (6) sleep deprivation; (7) occupational diseases; (8) lack of support from the company in coping with stress; (9) pilots’ yearly examination standards; (10) support with sports equipment; (11) respecting planned rest time; and (12) isolation periods. Discussion: The interviewed pilots experienced major psychological pressure from various sources, and their physical health condition was concerning.

There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots’ psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots’ mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique.

It is suggested that impaired cognitive performance accounts for most of the accidents during training courses and actual battle. There is a need to define when soldiers ' operational readiness becomes impaired. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of sustained military operations (SUSOPS) on vigilance, reaction time, working memory, and reasoning in order to select good indicators for performance impairment. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using publicly accessible databases (IngentaConnect, PubMed, Science Direct, and Defense Technical Information Center online) that were screened until July 2015. Keywords were military, sustained operations, (cognitive) performance, soldier, and training. Results: Only 7 out of 589 studies met the inclusion criteria. Selected studies were difficult to compare due to different methodologies, cognitive tasks, and military courses. Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory were affected after only a few hours, showing severe impairment. They are linearly related to military stress up to 80 h of SUSOPS. These three indicators needed little recovery time to return to baseline levels. After more than 80 h of SUSOPS, no significant impairments of those indicators were observed. Reasoning becomes impaired after high stress levels of relatively short duration and can remain affected after more than 80 h of SUSOPS. Discussion: Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory are affected after only a few hours while little recovery time is needed. For reasoning to return to baseline values, longer recovery is needed than the time available during SUSOPS. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", '<title>Psychophysiological intervention to improve preparedness in military special operations forces</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Actual studies in military training support the use of new methodological approaches such as high intensity interval training and inverse periodization training rather than conventional approaches. However, the application and analysis of success of these new methodologies are as yet unknown. METHODS: The military adapted the civil reverse periodization training system, composed of 6 wk and five sessions per week. For the first 3 wk soldiers performed two sessions with the objective of increasing the maximal strength of the upper and lower body muscles, and three sessions of short high-intensity interval training (HIIT). In the following 3 wk they combined two endurance HIIT and two resistance HIIT sessions with military equipment while conducting a military task. RESULTS: After the training a significant body mass index decrease was found, along with an increase in lower limb muscular strength, aerobic and anaerobic performance, resilience, stress tolerance, and psychological flexibility. Regarding the ratio of acceptance there was an increased ratio compared to previous years of 7%. In addition, married soldiers with children presented greater resilience, stress tolerance, psychological flexibility, and a higher ratio of success. DISCUSSION: Accepted soldiers presented greater psychological status and stress tolerance, highlighting the importance of the work of the unit psychologists to reinforce and monitor the psychometric profile of the soldiers as well as their intrinsic characteristics of personality and emotionality. The greater baseline physical condition and higher performance in all physical tests proves how reverse periodization training models are a great stimuli and training approach in soldiers. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>', '<title>Physiological, biochemical, and psychological responses to environmental survival training in the Royal Australian Air Force</title> <abstract>Military environmental survival training (EST) is designed and considered to evoke significant stressors to military personnel in preparation for combat-like scenarios.

Fourteen RAAF participants undertook the EST course. Physiological and psychological responses were collected across the 15 days across outcomes: (1) biochemical markers (blood lactate, interlukin-6, and creatine kinase), (2) performance and anthropometric indices (vertical jump, body mass), and (3) psychological questionnaires profile of mood states, depression anxiety stress scale, Kessler-10 etc.). Creatine kinase concentration increased significantly from baseline to day 5 (p < 0.05) and thereafter remained elevated for the remaining 10 days of EST (128%; p < 0.01). Vertical jump (-10%; p < 0.01) and body mass (-8%; p < 0.01) both decreased across 15 days of EST, while there were no significant change in interlukin-6. Negative psychological responses were observed for mood (p < 0.01), depression (p < 0.05), anxiety (p < 0.01), and stress (p < 0.01) following the EST course.

Military personnel are required to execute these tasks, and to perform to high levels of expectation. Many of these tasks are complex and demand substantial cognitive readiness, which may optimize and enhance cognitive performance. Technologies are being developed to aid individual soldiers to successfully complete their missions; however, the proliferation of new technologies, coupled with the varying operational missions, make leveraging cognitive readiness a mandate for the achievement of military effectiveness and enhanced overall performance. It is important to have a militarily relevant psychological battery that can be used to assess each individual's cognitive capabilities and appraisals, factors that enhance military operational effectiveness. Assessing individual cognitive readiness becomes particularly important when researchers broaden their examinations of military effectiveness to assess team cognition, team behavior, and team effectiveness. We discuss the theoretical development and the components of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Readiness Assessment and Monitoring System (RAMS). Data from several studies are presented to illustrate the behavioral profiles of individuals in extreme operational environments. Data show how specific factors (e.g., personality, coping) contribute to performance in operational settings (e.g., command and control, chemical decontamination operations). Understanding the effect of cognitive readiness on overall military effectiveness not only has implications for selection, training, and system design, but also provides the basis for the proactive development and sustainment of optimal performance, both in individual soldiers, and in small teams or military units.

There is currently no criterion standard of military readiness and there is also a lack of published readiness measures for the individual military service member, the fundamental building block of force readiness. This report describes the development and validation of the Military Readiness Scale-15 (MRS-15), a self-report instrument, in U.S. Naval Aircrew. Materials and Methods Scale items were developed by human performance scientists, including a psychometrician. The team developed 19 candidate items, which were administered to Naval Aircrew personnel (N = 164), along with validated measures of theoretically relevant constructs (e.g., pain). Factor structure of the scale was explored with principal components factoring, and Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization. Removal of 4 items yielded a highly consistent, 15-item scale. From the final scale, we derived a Total Military Readiness score with three readiness subscales that we termed General-Psychological, Technical, and Physical. Results We observed robust, age-adjusted relationships in the expected directions, between the Total Military Readiness score and bodily pain, fatigue, occupational stress, mental health symptoms, and sleep disruption. Conclusions The MRS-15 is a preliminarily valid and reliable self-report instrument that holds promise for evaluating perceived readiness. To this end, we conceptualized a ""readiness dashboard""prototype that is informed by MRS-15 data and can be integrated with a representative selection of other measures to display the readiness status of an individual or an entire unit. Altogether, this research can help to inform policy, training, and resourcing efforts to prepare Naval Aircrew for future engagements. © 2025 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background: The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method: A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results: Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board. Conclusion: PAV manufacturers, operators, and policymakers can utilize these findings to incorporate crucial design elements needed for PAVs to satisfy user expectations.

Yet, its potential benefits particularly hinge on penetration and utilization rates. To date, few studies have explored user acceptance of systems that integrate passenger and freight flows. In this context, a research gap that is particularly evident pertains to the user acceptance of different concepts within autonomous combined transport. Extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), this paper examines the effects of six psychological constructs on the behavioral intention to use an autonomous combined transport system. Surveying 1040 respondents from Germany, two distinct combined transport concepts—scheduled and on-demand—were examined to identify key acceptance factors and operational peculiarities. Results from structural equation modelling show that the acceptance of autonomous combined transport systems depends on both, the operational concept as well as the purpose of use, with socio-demographic characteristics featuring different indirect effects per concept. Moreover, we find that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, price value, personal attitude, and trust are significant predictors of behavioral intention across both concepts, while the average order frequency of a potential user has a negative indirect impact on behavioral intention. Results show that an extended UTAUT2 model can conceptualize factors influencing autonomous combined transport acceptance, emphasizing the importance of investigating a user’s behavioral intention based on the specific operational concept. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>', '<title>Pilots’ Willingness to Operate in Unmanned Aircraft System Integrated Airspace</title> <abstract>Background: Considerable research is underway on how to integrate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) safely and securely into the National Airspace System (NAS).

Results: Results from the mixed analysis of variance indicated a significant two-way interaction between airspace classification and type of integration and a significant main effect for airspace. Differences were observed for all classes of airspace except Class B and Class C for segregated operations and Class D and Class E for integrated operations. Conclusion: The effect size for the two-way interaction was small, and overall airspace had a significant influence on willingness with the highest score for Class B operations and the lowest score for Class G operations. Results from the study are expected to support the development of better policies, procedures, and training methods. © 2021 The MITRE Corporation.</abstract>']"

Among the various forms of motion sickness, air sickness has a significant impact on aircrew readiness and is often a cause for the grounding of aircrew. Unfortunately, standards for clinical testing to accurately predict the sensitivity of each individual to air-sickness are currently lacking. Furthermore, pharmacological prevention is contraindicated for aircrews, whose cognitive tasks involve a high level of vigilance. Therefore, a number of Air Forces have developed their own rehabilitation programmes to counteract air-sickness effects on flight personnel. These programmes may differ in several aspects, such as their duration, instruments used, costs and the technical characteristics of the rehabilitation team. However, reports in the specialized literature, refer to high rates of success, despite the above-mentioned differences. In the autumn of 2000, the Italian Air Force (ITAF) also began its own rehabilitation programme for air-sickness desensitisation. The programme was developed at the Aerospace Medicine Department of the ITAF Flight Test Centre, at the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base, Italy. The ITAF rehabilitation course lasts two weeks, and candidates are first classified according to their clinical history and to their reaction to the Coriolis Stress Test. Thereafter, subjects undergo a personalized desensitisation programme, involving increasingly more intense nauseogenic stimuli by means of various devices. At the same time, a psychological approach, based on autogenous training and cognitive-behavioural therapy, is adopted. The present report refers to data from 17 subjects treated from January 2001. The current clinical outcome is extremely encouraging, with a success rate of 88%. Nevertheless, several aspects of motion sickness rehabilitation are still under investigation, and further research programmes, aimed at improving the final clinical outcome and prolonging the benefits of rehabilitation, are needed.</abstract>', '<title>The Canadian Forces airsickness rehabilitation program, 1981-1991</title> <abstract>Airsickness is a significant obstacle in the training of some student pilots. When conventional therapy fails, desensitization therapy may be indicated. Using experience gained by the RAF and USAF, the Canadian Forces (CF) began such a program in 1981. This paper reports program results from 1981-1991. Following subject identification, treatment consists of three phases: biofeedback relaxation therapy, ground-based desensitization training and in-flight desensitization therapy with a pilot-flight surgeon. Employing a definition of cure used by the RAF, success was compared with that of the RAF and USAF programs. A total of 22 student pilots have undergone rehabilitation, 17 of whom have been successfully treated for a success rate of 77%. This is comparable to success rates of other programs. It is reaffirmed that desensitization is a valid clinical tool in treatment of airsickness.</abstract>', '<title>Autogenic feedback training exercise: A treatment for airsickness in military pilots</title> <abstract>In this article, we present physiological data from 2 male pilots who completed a 6-hr training program for control of motion sickness at National Aeronautic and Space Administration Ames Research Center. The program consisted of an Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise in which research participants learn through operant conditioning techniques to regulate several physiological responses to suppress their symptoms. We evaluated training progress during rotating-chair motion sickness tests. We assessed motion sickness tolerance by calculating the number of cumulative rotations that research participants were able to achieve in the rotating chair prior to reaching their major malaise endpoint. We rated motion sickness symptoms using a standard diagnostic scale. We obtained physiological data from one pilot during a training flight in an F-18 aircraft after completion of his training. Results demonstrate a significant increase in tolerance to laboratory-induced motion sickness tests and a reduction in autonomic nervous system response levels following training. During subsequent flight qualification tests on F-18 and T-38 aircraft, both pilots were successful at controlling their airsickness and were returned to active flight status.</abstract>', ""<title>Behavioral airsickness management program for student pilots</title> <abstract>The management of recurrent airsickness in student pilots has traditionally involved positive reinforcement of motivation and limited use of medication.

The objective of this study was to investigate how memory performance, in terms of encoding and/or retrieval processes, was affected by sustained +Gz exposure. Method: There were 18 healthy men ranging from experienced fighter pilots to novice riders who participated. A word continuous recognition task (CRT) was employed as a memory test. The task consisted of three consecutive phases: 1) encoding of familiar words at 1 G; 2) encoding and retrieval of words at 70% of the subject's relaxed G-tolerance level, equivalent to +3.7 ± 0.54 Gz; and 3) encoding and retrieval of words at 1 G. In addition, each subject performed the CRT in a 1-G-only control condition. Physiological and psycho-physiological measures included continuous monitoring of ECG, arterial oxygen saturation, arterial BP at head level, and response time. Results: Data analysis showed that the capability to recognize words encoded at 1 G did not differ between conditions, indicating that the retrieval process was insensitive to increased Gz load. However, the ability to recognize words previously encoded during G exposure was reduced by approximately 10% as compared with control. Since the analysis revealed that the words were perceived, this result suggests that the encoding process was impaired in hypergravity. Conclusion: The results indicate that memory encoding, but not retrieval, was affected negatively when exposed to substantial and sustained +Gz loads.

Also, since the mid-1980's, pilot awareness of G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) has been enhanced by briefings, videotapes, and safety articles. Aircraft accidents caused by an improperly performed anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM), however, continue to occur. Deficiencies in the AGSM of pilots in flight have not been systematically studied. A test program to reinforce the proper performance of the AGSM in flight was initiated in the United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) in 1993. Head-up display videotapes (HUD tapes) were recorded during flight and critiqued during debrief by flight leads for AGSM technique and continuity. Questionnaires were completed by F-16, F-15C, and F-15E pilots assigned to USAFE: 78 surveys were completed out of 110 distributed (71%). There were 57 pilots (73%) who reported one or more problems with their AGSM: 33 noted that the timing of their breathing was too quick (<2 s cycle), 11 that their breathing was too slow (>4 s), 9 that inhalation was too long, 18 occasionally did not 'get the jump on the Gs,' and 34 frequently or occasionally talked during +Gz exposures. Of the 105 reported deficiencies, 67 (64%) were mostly or completely corrected: 30/33 (91%) if the timing of breathing was too quick, 8/11 (73%) if too slow, 5/9 (56%) if inhalation too long, 12/18 (67%) 'jump on the Gs,' and 12/34 (35%) if they talked.

High speeds that modern aircraft develop during take-off, flight and landing place an additional strain on the organ of vision. Owing to its considerable practical implementation in air combat, the effect of +Gz acceleration on the organ of vision is considered increasingly important for research. Substantial changes in visual functions may occur during high acceleration onset rates. However, it is important for a pilot to maintain visual acuity in order to be able to monitor new functional displays for rapid orientation, scan the configuration of terrain, display of weapons systems and enemy aircraft and deal with additional issues of the complexity of spatial orientation. The aim of the investigation was to establish whether distance visual acuity in air force pilots and student pilots is affected when exposed to +Gz acceleration. Methods. The study was performed on a defined population consisting of 95 respondents from 21 to 45 years of age divided into two groups. The first group included 65 air force pilots and the second group comprised of 30 student pilots, all of whom were exposed to an acceleration of +5.5 Gz. The testing was performed in a human centrifuge, which mimics conditions of real Gz acceleration, in the Department of Biodynamics in Aero Medical Institute (Zemun, Serbia). We examined the obtained differences in distance visual acuity before and after exposure to acceleration. Results. After the testing, all respondents in the group of air force pilots had distance visual acuity of 1.0, while in the group of student pilots a statistically significant difference in distance visual acuity was observed after being exposed to +Gz acceleration. Conclusion. Transient changes in distant visual acuity were more pronounced in the group of student pilots in comparison with the changes in visual acuity in the air force pilots when exposed to the same acceleration values (+5Gz acceleration). Since change in distance visual acuity is the most sensitive physiological indicator when exposed to high acceleration, individual physiological pilot training in the human centrifuge increases tolerance to accelerations, which is important for flight safety in both peacetime and combat conditions. © 2022 Inst.

One of the problems is determining individual factors responsible for the differences in changes in the level of central nervous system (CNS) arousal after exposure to acceleration loads. We were interested in whether the coping style and anxiety as a trait might differentiate the subjects in terms of reactions of the CNS to +G<inf>z</inf> load-related stress. METHODS: Examined were 31 male volunteers with ages between 23 and 30 yr. Measurements were obtained under controlled conditions before, during, and every 2 min up to 12 min after centrifugation. The study was conducted using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory. The value of Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold (CFFT) corresponded to the level of CNS arousal. RESULTS: Two significantly different trends of changes in CNS arousal were identified: class 1 (higher level of fatigue following +G<inf>z</inf> load) and class 2 (lower level of fatigue following +G<inf>z</inf> load). Significant differences were observed in CISS scores with Task-Oriented Coping value in class 1 (M = 65.94, SD = 5.47) being considerably greater than in class 2 (M = 62, SD = 4.37). For Emotion-Oriented and Distraction Coping, the mean value in class 1 (M = 29.53, SD = 7.72; M = 16.82, SD = 3.8) was significantly lower than in class 2 (M = 34.33, SD = 6.68; M = 19.42, SD = 3.4). DISCUSSION: The nature of the changes in CFFT values over time is associated with coping style. Coping styles are very valuable in the prediction of CNS arousal caused by exposure to +G<inf>z</inf> stress. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Effect of G suit type on cognitive performance</title> <abstract>Background: Sustained acceleration protection ensembles are being developed to help pilots of high performance aircraft endure high G exposures for longer periods of time. It has been assumed that better G endurance confers better pilot task performance. This premise was studied on the Armstrong Laboratory Dynamic Environment Simulator centrifuge. Method: Human subjects repeatedly endured prolonged high-G simulated aerial combat on a centrifuge to the point of loss of vision or physical exhaustion. Some profiles included over 20 exposures to +9 Gz. While enduring the G exposures, subjects tracked a simulated 'bogey' aircraft on a visual display and performed a secondary task. Measures of cognitive function and physiologic status were taken throughout the exposures. G protection ensembles included the standard CSU 13 B/P anti-G suit, the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS), COMBAT EDGE positive pressure breathing system with the CSU 13 B/P, COMBAT EDGE with ATAGS, and the Northrop Advanced Protection System (APS). Results: More advanced protective systems not only allow longer G endurance, but provide adequate support for maintained cognitive performance throughout the extended exposure. Although measures were affected by the type of protective system the subject was wearing, as well as individual ability and coping strategies, consistent target tracking task performance, rapid choice reaction time, and sufficient arterial oxygen saturation were maintained throughout extended exposures to a point preceding termination by only a second or two. Conclusions: Those anti-G protection ensembles that cover and protect the body and which employ positive pressure breathing allow longer high G exposures which provide support for maintained cognitive performance.</abstract>""]"

In addition, the role of active or passive processing was examined. Background: Currently, there is little research that addresses how individuals with different levels of expertise process information in running memory when the information is needed to perform a real-world task. Method: Three groups of participants differing in their level of clinical expertise (novice, intermediate, and expert) performed an abstract running memory span task and two tasks resembling real-world activities, a clinical handoff task and an air traffic control (ATC) handoff task. For all tasks, list length and the amount of information to be recalled were manipulated. Results: Regarding processing strategy, all participants used passive processing for the running memory span and ATC tasks. The novices also used passive processing for the clinical task. The experts, however, appeared to use more active processing, and the intermediates fell in between. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicated that individuals with clinical expertise and a developed mental model rely more on active processing of incoming information for the clinical task while individuals with little or no knowledge rely on passive processing.

While flying a simulator, 12 pilots heard altitude and radio frequency instructions spoken in grouped format (""forty-one-hundred""), and 12 heard them sequentially (""four-thousand-one-hundred""). Only limited evidence was found that grouped message format improved pilot memory. Specifically, pilots who received altitude and radio frequency instructions in the grouped, rather than the sequential, format produced fewer requests for clarification, especially for longer messages. Pilots were also more likely to read back the grouped instructions in sequential format, suggesting that prior experience with the sequential format influenced pilot communication involving the relatively novel grouped format in this study.</abstract>', '<title>Speech intelligibility through communication headsets for general aviation</title> <abstract>Word discrimination was measured on eight general aviation pilots listening alternately through each of three communication headsets and an aircraft loudspeaker in the presence of light aircraft noise.

Mean intelligibility scores ranged from 73% through the loudspeaker to 92% through two of the headsets, although retesting through the loudspeaker at a higher signal level improved mean scores to 85%. Articulation functions obtained on four normally hearing listeners tested under the same conditions as the pilots revealed that, for situations when little or no attenuation was available (loudspeaker and one headset), greater signal-to-noise ratios were necessary to allow discrimination equivalent to that obtained under conditions of greater noise attenuation (two headsets). Although good intelligibility could be achieved through the loudspeaker given sufficient signal intensity (>100 dB SPL) some pilots preferred lower levels even though discrimination was reduced.</abstract>', ""<title>Investigation of air traffic controllers' response strategies in a free recall task: What makes auditory recall superior to visual recall?</title> <abstract>This study investigated the response strategies displayed by air traffic controllers (ATCs) recalling visually and auditory presented verbal material in a free recall task.

Method: The research methodology involves primary data through a tailored human factors survey of HEMS staff in Australia, and secondary data from historical ATSB (Australian Transport Safety Bureau) accident reports involving HEMS operations.

The rarity of these alarms associated with their possible unreliability may play a role in this misperception. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we manipulated both audiovisual conflict and sound rarity in a simplified landing task. Behavioral data and event related potentials (ERPs) of thirteen healthy participants were analyzed. We found that the presentation of a rare auditory signal (i.e. an alarm), incongruent with visual information, led to a smaller amplitude of the auditory N100 (i.e. less negative) compared to the condition in which both signals were congruent. Moreover, the incongruity between the visual information and the rare sound did not significantly affect reaction times, suggesting that the rare sound was neglected. We propose that the lower N100 amplitude reflects an early visual-to-auditory gating that depends on the rarity of the sound. In complex aircraft environments, this early effect might be partly responsible for auditory alarm insensitivity. Our results provide a new basis for future aeronautic studies and the development of countermeasures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>', '<title>Dual-task performance consequences of imperfect alerting associated with a cockpit display of traffic information</title> <abstract>Objective: Performance consequences related to integrating an imperfect alert within a complex task domain were examined in two experiments. Background: Cockpit displays of traffic information (CDTIs) are being designed for use in airplane cockpits as responsibility for safe separation becomes shared between pilots and controllers. Of interest in this work is how characteristics of the alarm system such as threshold, modality, and number of alert levels impact concurrent task (flight control) performance and response to potential conflicts. Methods: Student pilots performed a tracking task analogous to flight control while simultaneously monitoring for air traffic conflicts with the aid of a CDTI alert as the threshold, modality, and level of alert was varied. Results: As the alerting system became more prone to false alerts, pilot compliance decreased and concurrent performance improved. There was some evidence of auditory preemption with auditory alerts as the false alarm rate increased. Finally, there was no benefit to a three-level system over a two-level system. Conclusion: There is justification for increased false alarm rates, as miss-prone systems appear to be costly. The 4:1 false alarm to miss ratio employed here improved accuracy and concurrent task performance. More research needs to address the potential benefits of likelihood alerting. Application: The issues addressed in this research can be applied to any imperfect alerting system such as in aviation, driving, or air traffic control. It is crucial to understand the performance consequences of new technology and the efficacy of potential mitigating design features within the specific context desired.

Such failure of auditory attention is thought to rely on top-down biasing mechanisms at the central executive level. A complementary approach to account for this phenomenon is to consider the existence of visual dominance over hearing that could be implemented via direct visual-to-auditory pathways. To investigate this phenomenon, thirteen aircraft pilots, equipped with a 32-channel EEG system, faced a low and high workload scenarii along with an auditory oddball task in a motion flight simulator. Prior to the flying task, the pilots were screened to assess their working memory span and visual dominance susceptibility. The behavioral results disclosed that the volunteers missed 57.7% of the auditory alarms in the difficult condition. Among all evaluated capabilities, only the visual dominance index was predictive of the miss rate in the difficult scenario. These findings provide behavioral evidences that other early cross-modal competitive process than top down modulation process could account for inattentional deafness. The electrophysiological analyses showed that the miss over the hit alarms led to a significant amplitude reduction of early perceptual (N100) and late attentional (P3a and P3b) event-related potentials components. Eventually, we implemented an EEG-based processing pipeline to perform single-trial classification of inattentional deafness. The results indicate that this processing chain could be used in an ecological setting as it led to 72.2% mean accuracy to discriminate missed from hit auditory alarms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>', '<title>False alerts in air traffic control conflict alerting system: Is there a ""cry wolf"" effect?</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim is to establish the extent to which the high false-alarm rate of air traffic control midair conflict alerts is responsible for a ""cry wolf"" effect-where true alerts are not responded to and all alerts are delayed in their response. Background: Some aircraft collisions have been partly attributed to the cry wolf effect, and in other domains (health care and systems monitoring), there is a causal connection between false-alarm rate and cry wolf behavior. We hypothesized that a corresponding relationship exists in air traffic control (ATC). Method: Aircraft track and alert system behavior data surrounding 495 conflict alerts were analyzed to identify true and false alerts, trajectory type, and controller behavior. Forty-five percent of the alerts were false, ranging from 0.28 to 0.58. Results: Although centers with more false alerts contributed to more nonresponses, there was no evidence that these were nonresponses to true alerts or that response times were delayed in those centers. Instead, controllers showed desirable anticipatory behavior by issuing trajectory changes prior to the alert. Those trajectory pairs whose conflicts were more difficult to visualize induced more reliance on, and less compliance with, the alerting system. Conclusion: The high false-alarm rate does not appear to induce cry wolf behavior in the context of en route ATC conflict alerts. Application: There is no need to substantially modify conflict alert algorithms, but the conflict alert system may be modified to address difficult-to-visualize conflicts.

Background: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (e.g., alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking. Method: Twenty-eight general aviation pilots performed two landings in a flight simulator. In one scenario an auditory alert was triggered alone, whereas in the other the auditory alert occurred while the pilots dealt with a critical windshear. Results: In the windshear scenario, 11 pilots (39.3%) did not report or react appropriately to the alarm whereas all the pilots perceived the auditory warning in the no-windshear scenario. Also, of those pilots who were first exposed to the no-windshear scenario and detected the alarm, only three suffered from inattentional deafness in the subsequent windshear scenario. Conclusion: These findings establish inattentional deafness as a cognitive phenomenon that is critical for air safety.

Three hundred pilots were surveyed by questionnaire to examine the impact of working in the airline industry on personal relationships. Participants were recruited over a 4-year period between 2012 and 2016 on a university's Master's program in Air Transport Management. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis (TA).

Psychological well-being has been a popular research topic recently and has been shown to relate to mental health. The analysis of distinct population groups offers unique opportunities for the investigation of the interplay of the psychological, social, and physical elements of health. This study characterizes the psychological wellbeing of a unique, high stress occupational group, United States Air Force fliers (pilots and navigators). Data were obtained from a cross-sectional “Health Survey” of male fliers and nonfliers with 2485 respondents. Mental health was ascertained with an index of psychological well-being (PWB). Additionally, other data relevant to health status were collected. Results of the Alameda County, California, survey of PWB were also used for comparison. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression. Fliers were found to have significantly better PWB than nonfliers; this finding is in accord with clinical folklore regarding differences between fliers and nonfliers. Both Air Force groups had better PWB than that reported for Alameda County. There were no significant differences between pilots and navigators and no differences between pilots of different types of aircraft, results which contradict previous anecdotal reports. Young (age 21 to 28) active pilots were found to be a distinct group with significantly better PWB than any other group. Several variables made small but statistically significant contributions to explaining the variance in PWB. The best correlates of PWB were better self-reported overall health, lack of perceived time pressure, more competitive behavior, and a positive attitude toward physical fitness. The results are discussed in terms of the flier selection process, the intrinsic differences in those who select flying as a vocation, and the interaction of the flier’s developmental stage and his environment. © 1983 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.</abstract>', '<title>Pilot Work Related Stress (WRS), Effects on Wellbeing and Mental Health, and Coping Methods</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between sources of work-related stress (WRS) for pilots, effects on wellbeing, and coping mechanisms. Background: Recent studies have measured depression levels in pilots but not the relationship between depression levels and coping strategies. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted with commercial pilots. A regression model was advanced to analyze the relationship between each frequency level of each coping strategy and PHQ-9 Scores, and the Odds ratio was interpreted. Results: Sources of WRS impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Not all pilots are suffering. Over half met threshold for mild depression. Nearly 60% are using coping mechanisms to manage WRS and its impact on wellbeing. Pilots using coping mechanisms such as sleep management, taking physical exercise, and diet management were found to have lower depression severity levels. The findings of this study underscore the need to advance new tools to enable pilot self-management of their health and wellbeing. This includes new training tools, enhanced checklists, and new digital tools to support wellbeing awareness, stress coping, and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit.

Furthermore, specific features of the job can increase a pilot’s risk in relation to developing a mental health (MH) issue. It is impossible to remove all stress from the work life of pilots. A high stress situation may not necessarily be detrimental to the person, once they have learned to cope with it in a healthy manner. Nonetheless, risk pertaining to WRS need to be effectively managed by a pilot’s employer. Therefore, it is important to identify solutions at an airline and pilot self-management level. This paper reports on the findings of human factors research undertaken with commercial pilots pertaining to work-related stress (WRS) and its impact on wellbeing, performance, and safety. The findings of a series of co-design workshops and a follow-up anonymous survey were analysed to identify potential solutions at (1) an airline and (2) pilot self-management level. Potential solutions are framed in relation to six impact scenarios. Furthermore, they are located within the existing regulatory framework, including the latest implementation rules (IR), acceptable means of compliance (ACM), and guidance material (GM) as outlined by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA 2019). Proposed interventions should promote wellbeing and positive mental health while also addressing suffering and mental ill health. Airline interventions might focus on enhancing existing Safety Management System (SMS) approaches to better manage risks pertaining to WRS, advancing new tools to enable wellbeing briefing, risk assessment, and reporting, and training pilots in relation to MH awareness, risk identifying behaviour, and coping strategies. Furthermore, new role/functions might be introduced to support the implementation and management of WRS/wellbeing/MH safety/risk processes at an airline level. Requirements for new digital tools to support pilot awareness of WRS/wellbeing/MH, self-management of WRS/wellbeing/MH and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit are also proposed. Some of recommendations arising in this research require changes to the existing rule-making and/or modification to existing AMC and GM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>']"

There are reports of prominent physicians who practiced after becoming dangerous in old age, but the profession has not demonstrated the ability to prevent this. A mandatory retirement age could be discriminatory and take many competent physicians out of practice and risk a physician shortage. An increasing body of evidence regarding the relationship between physicians' age and performance has led organizations, such as the American College of Surgeons, to revisit this challenge. OBSERVATIONS: Since 1975, the number of practicing physicians older than 65 years in the United States has increased by more than 374%, and in 2015, 23% of practicing physicians were65 years orolder. Research shows that between ages40 and 75 years, the mean cognitive ability declines by more than 20%, but there is significant variability from one person to another, indicating that while some older physicians are profoundly impaired, others retain their ability and skills. There are age-based requirements for periodic testing and/or retirement for many professions including pilots, judges, air traffic controllers, Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, and firefighters. While there are not similar requirements for physicians, a few hospitals have introduced mandatory age-based evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: As physicians age, a required cognitive evaluation combined with a confidential, anonymous feedback evaluation by peers and coworkers regarding wellness and competence would be beneficial both to physicians and their patients. While it is unlikely that this will become a national standard soon, individual health care organizations could develop policies similar to those present at a few US institutions. In addition, large professional organizations should identify a range of acceptable policies to address the aging physician while leaving institutions flexibility to customize the approach. Absent robust professional initiatives in this area, regulators and legislators may impose more draconian measures. © 2017 American Medical Association.

In an effort to decrease pilot judgment-related accidents, the Federal Aviation Administration teaches new pilots about hazardous attitudes that are believed to be incompatible with safe flight: macho, impulsive, worry, resignation, self-confidence, and antiauthority. If these attitudes are hazardous for pilots and their passengers, they may also be incompatible with the reliable and safe delivery of surgical care. Questions/purposes: The purposes of this study were (1) to ascertain to what extent surgeons harbor hazardous attitudes; and (2) to determine their relationship, if any, to reoperation and readmission rates. Methods: We selected validated aviation psychology tools that are used to measure these attitudes in pilots. We converted the aviation scenarios to analogous situations for surgeons and invited all surgeons from one academic program to participate in this study. A total of 41 surgeons were eligible to participate; 37 (90%) completed the attitude prevalence protocol and 31 (76%) had complete reoperation and readmission data for the correlation and regression analysis. Attending orthopaedic surgeons completed the Modified Surgeon Hazardous Attitude Scale as well as a series of additional instruments. Results: Levels of macho thought to be hazardous in pilots were present in nine (24%) surgeons. Similar, elevated levels of self-confidence were found in three (8%) surgeons. High levels of impulsivity were found in 5% (two surgeons) and high levels of antiauthority were found in 3% (one surgeon). Only one (3%) surgeon reported elevated levels of worry and no surgeon reported hazardous levels of resignation. Thirty percent (11 surgeons) of surgeons harbored at least one elevated attitude level. In a regression model, macho attitude levels predicted 19% of the variation in surgeons’ rate of readmissions and reoperations. Conclusions: High levels of hazardous attitudes may not be consistent with the routine delivery of safe surgical care in a teamwork setting where human factors and safe systems are the key to success. Further research is needed to determine if abnormally high levels of these hazardous attitudes impact patient care. Level of Evidence: Level II, prognostic study.

Any misadventure in either of their working worlds can lead to death. Yet the pathways to certification and implicit attitudes toward training are quite different in these 2 disciplines and provide an opportunity to compare and contrast the methodologies employed. At the 5th annual Innovations in the Surgical Environments Conference, senior and junior aviators and surgeons shared their experiences from the perspective of trainee and trainer and in the process presented an interesting study in parallels and contrasts. The US Navy follows a highly regimented training syllabus with graduated levels of responsibility designed to create the safest possible flying environment. Extensive preflight and postflight effort is required for each mission flown. Surgical training is also hierarchal in responsibility, but graduates demonstrate greater variability in their training experience. The surgical field can only fortify its emphasis on safety by seeking to provide the optimal training experiences necessary in the high-stakes environment of the operating theater. In doing so, surgeons may find reinvigorated commitment through study of the aviation industry's established methods of training and practice. © 2009 Sage Publications.</abstract>""]"

Seven commercial airline pilots completed the Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check (SPC), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), Dual-N-Back, Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and aviation-specific mathematical calculations as well as a computerised flight simulator task, during which participants were required to answer mid-flight fuel calculations and situational awareness questions (SA). Testing occurred at 3 hour intervals during the final 12 hours of a 24 hour period of continuous wakefulness. Significant impairments in performance were observed on nearly all tests following 20 hours continuous wakefulness. Flying performance was not significantly impaired.

All Israeli aircrew and unmanned aerial vehicle operators participated in a “Dead Tired” workshop. During the workshop, the participants performed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, a task that tests their attention abilities, while gathering information on their subjective sleepiness in the form of a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Data of 366 participants (25 females), of whom 187 were unmanned aerial vehicle operators and 179 were aircrew, were obtained; and the mean age was 21.8 ± 1.2 years (range 19–26 years). A significant decline in task performance was seen following 20 hr of wakefulness in both unmanned aerial vehicle operators and aircrew (p < 0.001). Unmanned aerial vehicle operators' performance was significantly better throughout the majority of the workshop (p < 0.001). Recovery after the full-night's sleep was seen for unmanned aerial vehicle operators, but not for aircrew (p = 0.008).

Methods: Eight military pilots on flight status performed the primary task of flying a simulated 12.5-h overnight mission in an Air Refueling Part Task Trainer (ARPTT). Response omission to presentation of single- and double-light stimuli displayed in random sequence across the cockpit instrument panel was the metric used to assess choice visual perception task (CVPT) performance. Deviation from an established azimuth heading in the ARPTT during the CVPT was the flight metric used to assess complex motor performance. Speed, lapse, false start, and anticipation were the metrics used to assess psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance during crew rest periods. Results: Significant visual perceptual, complex motor, and psychomotor vigilance (speed and lapse) impairments occurred at 19 h awake in the eight-subject group. CVPT response omissions significantly correlated with ARPTT azimuth deviations at r = 0.97, and with PVT speed at r = -0.92 and lapses at r = 0.90. ARPTT azimuth deviations significantly correlated with PVT speed at r = -0.92 and lapses at r = 0.91. Conclusions: Acute sleep deprivation degrades visual perceptual, complex motor, and simple motor performance. Complex motor impairments strongly correlate with visual perceptual impairments. This research provides support for the use of visual perceptual measures as surrogates of complex motor performance in operational situations where the primary cognitive inputs are through the visual system.

The impact of this can be detrimental to the health of the individual as well as the success of the RPA mission. To address these concerns, a combat-to-reconstitution policy was developed to provide additional downtime and recovery to RPA personnel, and recently piloted in some units within the RPA community. A total of 397 RPA personnel, of which 26% (n = 103) indicated their schedule was either internal or external reconstitution, completed an anonymous occupational health assessment sometime between November 2021 and July 2022. Responses included a mixture of both positive and negative experiences during the implementation of reconstitution, along with recommendations for improvements. Certain reconstitution-related sources of stress (e.g. work overload, lack of resources), were found to increase risk of burnout or psychological distress. Overall, this preliminary study provides a foundational landscape for the scientific and operational understanding of reconstitution as an operational intervention to improve recovery. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

The results will help guide development of Realistic Job Preview (RJP) videos for new recruits considering an RPA SO career. Background: Despite burgeoning demand and insufficient manning for RPAs to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities, research on the factors that contribute to operator job satisfaction and retention has been limited. Method: One hundred ten RPA SOs were surveyed to assess factors thought to affect person-job fit. Thematic content analysis by independent raters was done to provide insight into factors that (1) may make the RPA career field a good or poor fit, (2) unique challenges and rewards of the career field, (3) misconceptions about the career field, and (4) job characteristics influencing retention decisions. Results: A high level of agreement (mean Cohen’s kappa\xa0= 0.73) occurred across pairs of raters.

Factors such as exposure to visually traumatic events compounded by long working hours and blurred boundaries between military and civilian life have been cited as potential stressors. Robust research into the well-being of RPAS operators is scarce and mostly samples US personnel. Aims: To provide mental health and well-being data relating to UK RPAS operators. Methods: UK RPAS operators completed mental health questionnaires to assess levels of post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms, alcohol use and occupational functioning. Respondents were also asked about work patterns. Results: Forty-one per cent of the sample reported potentially hazardous alcohol use. Ten per cent met psychiatric symptom criteria for moderate or severe anxiety, and 20% for moderate depressive symptoms. While there were no cases of probable PTSD, 30% of the sample reported sub-clinical PTSD symptoms likely to impair occupational functioning. Overall, 70% of the sample reported that psychological symptoms significantly impaired their functioning. Conclusions: Compared to UK military sub-groups, RPAS operators were not at increased risk of mental health problems. However, a high proportion of the sample reported significant functional impairment, which has not been explored in other comparable studies. The most frequently highlighted work-related stressors were timing of RPAS work and operator shift patterns. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The crews are responsible for working seamlessly together to provide 24/7 real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and precision-strike weapons capabilities for a wide range of global combat operations. Due to the rapid increase in global demands and operational tempo, there is growing concern from military leadership about the impact of operational stress on the health and psychological well-being of remote warriors. Previous assessments from 2011 and 2015 have demonstrated a significant increase in the reported rates of operators experiencing suicide ideation. The current study examined two protective factors expected to reduce the risk of suicide ideation–team member social support and leader social support. A total of 905 active duty remote warriors participated in occupational health assessments conducted in 2018. Risk factors for suicide ideation included being unmarried, worsening relationship problems, occupational burnout, and increased operational stress. Results indicated that team member and leader social support were significant protective factors for shift workers and those who reported being less likely to seek mental healthcare. Implications of the findings, intervention recommendations, and directions for future research are discussed. © 2021 Neurostat Analytical Solutions.</abstract>']"

The purpose of this study was to analyze the possible relationship of a history of allergic rhinitis with the occurrence of acute sinusitis in Israeli air force pilots. A comparative case series was conducted. Methods: Events of acute sinusitis were compared between Israeli air force pilots with (n = 54) and without (n = 82) allergic rhinitis who presented for their annual physical examination. Results: Previous episodes of acute sinusitis were noted in 33% of the pilots with allergic rhinitis and 21% of the control group (p = 0.09). A separate analysis of young pilots (<26 years old) yielded corresponding rates of 57% versus 29% (p < 0.001). When the groups were divided by type of pilot, the results showed that 54% of the transport pilots, 34% of the fighter pilots, and 13% of the helicopter pilots with rhinitis also suffered from acute sinusitis, as opposed to 28, 15, and 15%, respectively, of the control group. Conclusion: Despite careful selection, allergic rhinitis is still a very common disease in pilots and may pose a risk of acute sinusitis. The lower prevalence of acute sinusitis in combat than in transport pilots with rhinitis may be explained by vasoconstriction due to psychological and physiological stress during flight missions.

Cabin air on commercial aircraft is sometimes contaminated with hydraulic fluids, synthetic jet engine oils and combusted or pyrolized materials. The incidence of contaminated air events is hard to quantify as commercial aircraft do not have air quality monitoring systems on board. In the UK, around 350 aircrew have advised their union that they may be suffering physical and psychological ill health following exposure to contaminated air. Design. This paper presents a case series of 27 pilots referred for psychological assessment. The general aim of the assessment was to determine whether pilots show evidence of cognitive impairment and whether this relates to exposure history. Materials and method. All pilots underwent neuropsychological and adult mental health assessment, undertaken by 12 examiners, instructed to search for alternative explanations other than exposure to toxic fumes for any symptoms reported. Results. Pilots reported alarming cognitive failures at work such as being unable to retain or confusing numerical information from Air Traffic Control. Nine pilots were excluded from further analysis because they had a medical or psychiatric condition which might otherwise explain these difficulties. In the remaining 18 pilots, language, perceptual skills and general intellectual ability were preserved, but performance on tests of psychomotor speed, attention and executive functioning was below expected levels. Conclusions. The cognitive deficits identified in this cohort of pilots cannot be attributed to factors such as mood disorder or malingering. However, the evidence available in this study does not enable firm conclusions to be drawn regarding a causal link with contaminated air; the cohort of pilots was self-selected and only crude indices of exposure were available. Further research is warranted given the scientific uncertainty regarding the health effects of inhalation of heated or pyrolized engine oil. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Three patients with probable aerotoxic syndrome</title> <abstract>Introduction: “Aerotoxic syndrome” is a debated entity. Regulatory authorities consider long-term health effects to be an unlikely consequence of exposure to contaminated air because several air quality monitoring studies report low concentrations of toxic chemicals in cabin air. We describe two pilots and one flight attendant, who developed ill health during their flying career which improved after cessation of flying. Case details: The most frequently reported symptoms were headache, balance problems, fatigue, gastro-intestinal complaints and cognitive impairment. One of these patients had reduced levels of butyrylcholinesterase after a flight suggesting exposure to organophosphate compounds had occurred. All three were found to have elevated neuronal and glial auto-antibodies, biomarkers of central nervous system injury, and all three had genetic polymorphisms of paraoxonase (PON-1) and two of cytochrome P450, leading to a reduced ability to metabolize organophosphate compound (OPs). Discussion: A similar constellation of symptoms has been described in other studies of aircrew, although objective evidence of exposure is lacking in most of these studies. Reduced levels of butyrylcholinesterases in one of our cases is suggestive of causation and elevated neuronal and glial autoantibodies provide objective evidence of damage to the central nervous system. We consider further research is warranted. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>']"

Air traffic control is one of the most sensitive and important jobs in the field of flight safety. Working in such a context requires the use of high levels of cognitive functions, which can be impaired or reduced in speed and accuracy under pressure and stress. Another issue is that cognitive functions interact with non-cognitive factors, one of which is personality traits. Through using a causal-comparative method, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive functions like situational awareness, short-term memory, sustained attention and planning ability, and personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and adventurousness, on air traffic controllers’ human error by controlling the effect of age. For this purpose, five tests were selected from the Vienna Test System, namely MR, CORSI, DAUF, TOL-F, and EPP6, to measure controllers’ cognitive functions and personality traits. By convenience sampling, 37 controllers from the air control center participated in the tests. Excluding outliers, the groups were as follows: 16 controllers with error history and 15 controllers without error history. To control the effect of age on cognitive functions and personality traits, the groups’ data were compared using the covariance analysis. According to the results, there is a difference between groups in situational awareness (sig = 0.008, P ≤ 0.05) and sustained attention (sig = 0.01, P ≤ 0.05), with error-free controllers showing higher scores in these functions. However, in other cognitive functions that were studied, namely short-term memory (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05) and planning ability (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05), no difference was shown between the two groups. Moreover, the study of personality traits showed that controllers with errors differ from controllers without errors (sig = 0.02, P ≤ 0.05), but in emotionality (sig = 0.7, P ≤ 0.05) and adventurousness (sig = 0.6, P ≤ 0.05) there are no differences between the two groups. With these results in mind, efforts can be made to minimize potential errors in sensitive occupations such as air traffic control by using cognitive and personality screening tools. © 2021</abstract>', '<title>How life experience shapes cognitive control strategies: The case of air traffic control training</title> <abstract>Although human flexible behavior relies on cognitive control, it would be implausible to assume that there is only one, general mode of cognitive control strategy adopted by all individuals. For instance, different reliance on proactive versus reactive control strategies could explain inter-individual variability. In particular, specific life experiences, like a highly demanding training for future Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs), could modulate cognitive control functions. A group of ATC trainees and a matched group of university students were tested longitudinally on task-switching and Stroop paradigms that allowed us to measure indices of cognitive control. The results showed that the ATCs, with respect to the control group, had substantially smaller mixing costs during long cue-target intervals (CTI) and a reduced Stroop interference effect. However, this advantage was present also prior to the training phase. Being more capable in managing multiple task sets and less distracted by interfering events suggests a more efficient selection and maintenance of task relevant information as an inherent characteristic of the ATC group, associated with proactive control. Critically, the training that the ATCs underwent improved their accuracy in general and reduced response time switching costs during short CTIs only. These results indicate a training-induced change in reactive control, which is described as a transient process in charge of stimulus-driven task detection and resolution. This experience-based enhancement of reactive control strategy denotes how cognitive control and executive functions in general can be shaped by real-life training and underlines the importance of experience in explaining inter-individual variability in cognitive functioning. © 2016 Arbula et al.

A secondary exploratory objective was to analyze individual differences in task performance. Methods: A total of 88 participants (36 aerospace engineers and 52 undergraduate psychology students) participated in this experiment performing a standard drug-related contingency judgment task (with a fictitious drug that could be effective for a fictitious disease) and a novel analogue task with aerospace content. In both tasks, there was a null contingency between treatment and recovery. However, the chance of spontaneous recovery was 70%, a baseline rate which tends to produce strong illusion of control effects in null contingency setups. The participants were tasked to identify the treatment effectivity (the normative answer was no effectivity at all). Results: The data showed a strong illusion of control with no significant difference between groups and tasks. A non-negligible number of participants displayed inefficient strategies during task performance. Discussion: Both tasks produced comparable results with no significant differences.

Background: Error-encouragement training is said to be more effective than error-avoidance training because active exploration and error encouragement promote better learning and transfer. Past research, which is limited by confounded experimental designs involving simple tasks with little consideration of individual differences, provides evidence for the value of active exploration but less so for error encouragement. Method: We randomly allocated 164 participants to receive error-encouragement, error-avoidance, or no error-related instructions in training on ATC-lab, a dynamic computer simulated air traffic control task. Active exploration and task information were controlled, and ability and personality were assessed. Results: Error encouragement yielded better transfer performance than did error avoidance but was no better than the control training. Higher- rather than lower-ability trainees benefited from training with an error orientation (positive or negative), suggesting that learning from errors in training requires greater cognitive resources. Trainees higher in openness to experience and agreeableness performed more poorly with error-avoidance training than with error-encouragement and control training. Conclusion: Error-avoidance training had a detrimental effect especially for those less open to experience, lower in agreeableness, and of lower ability. The significant benefits of error-encouragement training reported in previous research were probably attributable to confounding factors, such as active exploration and differential task information. Application: Although errors and active exploration can be useful learning tools in training, trainers should be mindful that focusing on errors, whether positively or negatively, may not suit everyone.

Despite considerable research, an explanation of this effect has been elusive. A mathematical model for glide-slope perception was published recently based on the premise that a desirable goal of perception is to form a perception with minimal uncertainty. One of the qualitative predictions of that model was that changes in the aspect ratio of the runway would affect the perceived glide-slope. In this article, the predictions of the model are quantified and are shown to be in close agreement with experimental results in the literature.</abstract>', '<title>An analysis of slant for guidance of landing approaches</title> <abstract>For landing without visual aids, judgment of slant angle from texture gradients may be the primary strategy used by pilots to maintain a constant angle of descent toward a runway aimpoint. A mathematical analysis was undertaken to assess whether 1 or more of the available texture gradients have the properties required to support this strategy. The analysis revealed that texture gradients in themselves could not be useful. A relative gradient proportionalized against size of texture elements could, however, support descent-path control. Although not mathematically invariant, the departures from invariance of these relative gradients are too small to be functionally significant. In addition, relative gradients are sensitive to minimum functionally significant changes in angle of descent, whereas absolute gradients are not. Thus, relative gradients satisfy the formal requirements of an invariant for control of action.</abstract>', '<title>Display Magnification for Simulated Landing Approaches</title> <abstract>Previous discussions of simulated landings suggest that biases not found during aircraft flight are induced by one or more features of a simulator. Inadequate representation of texture or of ground detail and distortions in judgments of size from near accommodation to a display are two of the factors that have been thought to contribute to these biases. Addition of surface detail and magnification of the display have been suggested as corrective solutions. The research reported here was a preliminary investigation of the effects of factors that might induce biased landing approaches in a simulator and of a procedure for calibrating a simulator to eliminate biases. Scene content, display magnification, runway size, and start point all influenced glideslope control. With an appropriate start point and appropriate runway dimensions, there was a close correspondence between performance in an aircraft and performance in a simulator in which the display magnification had been set at unity and in which a moderate level of scene detail was presented. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This dangerous illusion can cause pilots to compensate by flying lower than intended, which can result in them crashing into the ground or obstacles in front of the runway. A common interpretation of the BHI is that it is a perceptual illusion, and two quantitative perception based theories have been proposed. The first theory was developed by Perrone (1983), and it assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to the loss of contextual information surrounding the runway, such as ground texture, during nighttime landing conditions. Adapted from work by Galanis et al. (1998) and Robinson et al. (2020), the second (eye-level) theory assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to loss of the horizon during nighttime landing conditions. Quantitative analyses of Perrone's theory suggest that the magnitude of the illusion should vary with runway width and length in nighttime conditions, but in daylight conditions there should be no illusion and no effect of runway width or length. Analyses of the eye-level theory predict no impact of runway width or length for any condition. Across two empirical laboratory studies, we do demonstrate a BHI for nighttime evaluations of descent angle, but the data do not support either theory. Thus, the two algorithms analyzed here are not sufficient to explain the BHI; and the BHI may reflect general disorientation due to limited information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"", '<title>Investigating a Computational Explanation of the Black Hole Illusion</title> <abstract>Objective: We investigated the role of Perrone’s algorithm in the Black Hole Illusion (BHI). After analyzing the algorithm and identifying two of its predictions, we empirically tested them with two on-line experiments. Background: In 1983, Perrone proved that in daylight conditions it is possible to compute the descent angle using a ratio of retinal distances corresponding to the runway and surrounding context. Using the algorithm in nighttime conditions, with just the visible runway, pilots would overestimate the descent angle, leading to the BHI. Method: Mathematical analysis indicates the algorithm predicts a large BHI; perhaps too large if there are no mitigating factors. As Perrone noted, the BHI illusion magnitude should be affected by runway width; we also found that some conditions predict a reverse BHI (pilots should underestimate their descent angle). In our experiments, participants observed a cockpit view of a runway during five seconds of steady approach. In a subsequent still image, participants indicated where they believed the plane would land if it continued its flight path. We measured the accuracy of the landing positions for various runway widths and various background contexts. Results: The experiments did not show a BHI for any conditions; so the experiments do not validate the model predictions.

Background: Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Black Hole Illusion (BHI), with differing predictions. The Constant Visual Angle hypothesis predicts that short runways should cause greater BHI. Meanwhile, several other hypotheses predict that longer runways should cause more severe BHI. In addition, there is debate whether lack of ground cues promotes BHI via autokinesis or by biasing pilots’ perception of the runway. Method: Nineteen qualified pilots flew 27 simulated nighttime approaches in a fixed-base flight simulator. Participants flew under different combinations of runway length, starting distance from the runway, and starting altitude. We analyzed glideslope error, defined as a weighted sum of the error above or below a prescribed 3° glideslope, as well as RMSE around the approach path. Results: We found that pilots tended to demonstrate worse BHI effects during approaches to longer runways and when starting at low altitudes compared to high altitudes. Daylight and nighttime flights showed a similar variance around the glideslope. Conclusion: The constant visual angle hypothesis is not supported by our findings. We observed consistent glideslopes across starting locations and similar variance during day/night conditions, leading us to favor biased perception of the runway over autokinetic effects to explain the influence of contextual features on BHI. ©, The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Navy, Department of Defense, nor the U.S. Government.

Background: BHI occurs when impoverished visual conditions at night cause pilots to fly too low on landing approaches. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain BHI, without clear consensus in the literature. Method: We conducted multiple experiments in which participants judged the intersection point of dotted lines on a computer screen. In Experiment 1, participants placed a horizon line where they believed two converging dotted line segments should intersect. In Experiments 2A and 2B, participants estimated the intersection point of single dotted line segments with a separate solid line. Results: Participants in Experiment 1 tended to place the intersection point of two converging lines too low on the computer screen. Participants in Experiments 2A and 2B tended to respond as if the stimulus lines were more horizontal than actually presented. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pilots misjudge the location of an implicit horizon based on the runway edge lines. In the context of a visual spatial strategy that assumes a stable horizon, such a misperception may cause pilots to adopt a low flight path. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

The results confirmed the sensitivity of the theta and beta activities to levels of task difficulty in the 3-back task, while they were not affected in the AX-CPT. Theta and beta activities were influenced by time of day in the AX-CPT. The findings provide guidance for application of changes in EEG parameters when MWL level is manipulated during the day that could be implemented in future for the development of real-time monitoring systems to improve aviation safety. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>', '<title>Emotional and cognitive influences in air traffic controller tasks: An investigation using a virtual environment?</title> <abstract>Air traffic controllers are required to perform complex tasks which require attention and high precision. This study investigates how the difficulty of such tasks influences emotional states, cognitive workload and task performance. We use quantitative and qualitative measurements, including the recording of pupil dilation and changes in affect using questionnaires. Participants were required to perform a number of air traffic control tasks using the immersive human accessible Virtual Reality space in the “eXperience Induction Machine”. Based on the data collected, we developed and validated a model which integrates personality, workload and affective theories. Our results indicate that the difficulty of an air traffic control task has a direct influence on cognitive workload as well as on the self-reported mood; whereas both mood and workload seem to change independently. In addition, we show that personality, in particular neuroticism, affects both mood and performance of the participants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', ""<title>Time Required for Transmission of Time-Critical Air Traffic Control Messages in an En Route Environment</title> <abstract>This article examines the time required for an air traffic control specialist to successfully transmit a message containing a maneuver required for traffic avoidance to a pilot in the en route environment.

Forty-six hours of voice tapes from three Air Route Traffic Control Centers were analyzed, yielding 80 maneuvers issued for traffic avoidance. The mean total time required for message transmission was found to be 11 sec. In the analysis, this total was broken down into its component parts: (a) duration of the controller's message, (b) time between the end of the controller's message and the beginning of the pilot's response, and (c) duration of the pilot's acknowledgment. Transmissions that relayed turn clearances for reasons other than traffic avoidance and relayed traffic advisories were also examined.

Yet, it is unclear whether such findings can be extended in less controlled setups. By employing air traffic controllers in a real aviation environment, we tested whether tasks with different levels of cognitive load can affect their timing behavior. Participants completed temporal production, verbal estimation, and passage of time judgments, while actively engaging in real flight control sessions. Subjective assessments of task demands, as well as physiological responses (cardiac and electrodermal activity) were also measured. Accuracy of the produced intervals was measured at two distinct phases of the flight (during low-load cruising vs. high-load landing) and under two different task load manipulations (controlling one vs. two helicopters and speaking in native vs. non-native language). Analysis of interval production accuracy showed that during the high-load landing phase significant overproductions were made, compared to the low-load cruising phase, and landing two helicopters led to greater overproductions compared to landing only one. The duration of the two-helicopter sessions was significantly overestimated compared to the single-helicopter ones, and the passage of time was felt significantly faster. Subjective assessments of workload were positively correlated with the temporal estimations and passage of time judgments, and skin responses were positively correlated with the produced intervals. Overall, our results are consistent with past research, suggesting that mental workload modulates time perception in complex, real-world environments, thus making timing behavior a reliable index of the workload changes. © 2023 The Authors</abstract>']"

Traditionally, selective attention was thought to facilitate perception by increasing the gain of sensory neurons tuned to the defining features of a behaviorally relevant object (e.g., color, orientation, etc.). In contrast, recent mathematical models counterintuitively suggest that, in many cases, attentional gain should be applied to neurons that are tuned away from relevant features, especially when discriminating highly similar stimuli. Here we used psychophysical methods to critically evaluate these ""ideal observer"" models. The data demonstrate that attention enhances the gain of the most informative sensory neurons, even when these neurons are tuned away from the behaviorally relevant target feature. Moreover, the degree to which an individual adopted optimal attentional gain settings by the end of testing predicted success rates on a difficult visual discrimination task, as well as the amount of task improvement that occurred across repeated testing sessions (learning). Contrary to most traditional accounts, these observations suggest that the primary function of attentional gain is not to enhance the representation of target features per se, but instead to optimize performance on the current perceptual task. Additionally, individual differences in gain suggest that the operating characteristics of low-level attentional phenomena are not stable trait-like attributes and that variability in how attention is deployed may play an important role in determining perceptual abilities.

In two experiments, participants made rapid judgements about the number of items present in a visual display. Within each display, items were grouped into a canonical representation (e.g., triangle, square, and pentagon) or were arranged linearly. In both experiments, grouping information facilitated enumeration performance, replicating previous findings in the literature. In Experiment 2, the facilitative effect of grouping information was found to be greater for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) than for matched novices, though they were no better than novices on linear arrays. This may be because linear, like canonical arrays, hold unique numerosity information, but only when they contain the minimum number of points necessary to define a line (i.e., 2). So ATCs' performance on linear arrays containing more than two items does not benefit from a facilitative effect of grouping information. That their experience of being ATCs, in terms of years served, was shown to account for the expertise effect suggests that such visuospatial expertise is acquired through frequent exposure to spatial arrays. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Four recent reports of accidents occurring in 1997 in Indonesia, 1999 in Massachusetts in the United States, 2013 in Namibia, and 2015 in France related to commercial aircraft-assisted suicides were analyzed. This analysis relied on data extracted from the accident reports that supported aircraft-assisted suicide from the: (a) cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR), (b) medical history, (c) psychosocial history, (d) toxicology, (e) autopsy, and (f) any methodology that utilized aviation medicine. There are some limitations in this study. Although all analyzed accident investigations followed ICAO Annex 13 guidelines, there is variability in their accident investigations and reporting. In addition, accident investigation reports represent accidents from 1997 to 2015, and during this time, there has been a change in the way accidents are reported. The nature of this analysis is explorative. The aim was to identify how the various aircraft accident investigators concluded that the accidents were due to suicidal acts. Results: In all four accident reports, FDR data were available. CVR data were also available, except for one accident where CVR data were only partially available. Comprehensive medical and psychosocial histories were available in only one of four of the accident reports. Conclusion: To prevent accidents involving commercial aircraft, it is necessary to identify the causes of these accidents to be able to provide meaningful safety recommendations. A detailed psychological autopsy of pilots can and likely will assist in investigations, as well as generate recommendations that will substantially contribute to mitigating accidents due to pilot suicide. Airborne image recording may be a useful tool to provide additional information about events leading up to a crash and thus assist in accident investigations. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>Extended suicide, or homicide followed by suicide</title> <abstract>Background: Suicide with accompanying homicide is frightening and ill understood. Aims: To raise professional awareness of its complexities and difficulties and identify areas for developing research. Method: A Crime in Mind seminar was held in London in December 2018, with four expert presentations and discussion. This paper draws on that seminar and supplementary literature. Findings: Homicide/suicide is very difficult to predict and thus prevent. Victims and perpetrators may have a dependency relationship. Better training, especially of general practitioners, may increase the likelihood of detecting signs of despair and delusional ideas. Psychiatrists should be more alert to fixed delusions and homicidal thoughts. Individual assessment and management alone is unlikely to be sufficient. Public health strategies are likely to be important too. Weapons control is vital. Employers of people with great personal responsibility and special access to potentially lethal tools, such as airline pilots, and perhaps clinicians, should have regular, compulsory, mental health checks.

But one person, the NASA manager who gave final approval for the Challenger launch, especially has to feel a sense of grief and responsibility. Caught between the pressure to satisfy politicians, the American people, NASA's launch schedule, and a complicated array of possible system failures, he made a decision that proved fatal. On a much more routine but no less lethal scale, most aviation operations managers are caught between the pressure to run an efficient, lean, and responsive operation and the ever-present possibility that an overlooked or underestimated “O-ring” will fail. In the aviation business, the human element is the weak link or “O-ring” more often than not. As the NASA manager knows only too well, no matter who is the pilot-incommand, the manager who selects the pilot; sets crew standards and duty cycles; and establishes company weather minimums and other operating standards is ultimately responsible for operational safety. This article is intended to provide an easy reference to the operating pitfalls, the human frailties, and the risks associated with managing flight operations. Helicopter air-ambulance operators are used to illustrate specific problems and provide extreme examples.

This was tested in a scenario of an airline accident of uncertain cause, finding that respondents blamed the airline the most among a list of five blamable entities (pilots, mechanics-maintenance-inspectors, the weather, ground crew-air traffic control, and airline). Additionally, based on the virtue theory of ethics and the moral character perspective of blame psychology, it was hypothesized that manipulation of the virtue of the airline (mercenary versus altruistic) would result in less blame assigned to the altruistic airline in a quasi-experiment where the other factor was outcome of the accident (safe landing with a few injuries versus crash with many fatalities). However, the two factors significantly interacted in an unexpected way. The mercenary airline suffering a crash was blamed less than the altruistic airline that crashed, while the mercenary airline that safely landed was blamed more than the altruistic airline that safely landed.

This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction. © 2009 INFORMS.</abstract>']"

In general, saturated colors, like those produced by LEDs, appear brighter than less saturated lights, like those produced by incandescent sources. Methods: We describe a series of experiments quantifying the brightness of simulated blue, white, and green LED signal lights relative to incandescent signal lights of the same hue. Simulated signal lights and arrays were compared against dark and against dimly lighted backgrounds, and through simulated fog. Results: The results confirm that LED signal lights are brighter than incandescent signals at matched luminous intensities. Brightness relationships were unaffected by background light level, and by the number of signals viewed, but the simulated fog reduced the brightness difference between the incandescent and LED signal lights. Conclusions: The present results could not be accurately predicted by several previously published models of brightness appearance, probably because of differences in experimental conditions. We present a new model that can be used to predict signal light brightness for blue, white, and green signal colors. Except for very short-wavelength blue signal lights, the model was able to accurately predict the present brightness data as well as those from previously published independent experiments.

The current luminous efficiency functions are derived from human sensitivity experiments taken at low light levels compared with the outdoor day-time environment. The amount of error induced by extrapolating from low light level data to high light level applications is not known. We sought to determine whether standard luminous efficiency curves CIE V(λ) and CIE Heterochromatic Brightness Matching are appropriate for measuring day-use optical equipment such as display phosphors, lasers, LEDs, and laser eye protection, which are becoming more common in aviation. Methods: Flicker photometry and successive heterochromatic brightness matching were used to measure changes in luminance efficiency functions with increasing levels (1, 10, 100, and 1000 ft.) of light adaptation. Results: Luminous efficiency was found to depend on both the method and the reference intensity with which the measurements were taken. For heterochromatic brightness matching, luminous efficiency increased for longer wavelengths as reference intensity increased. Peak luminous efficiency shifted from approximately 540 nm to greater than 600 nm with increasing intensity. Peak luminous efficiency was constant for flicker photometry across all intensities, but the function narrowed slightly at 100 fL. Conclusion: Luminous efficiency curves measured at high reference intensities are substantially different from the standard luminous efficiency functions. Caution should be used when measuring spectrally narrow and bright sources such as lasers and LEDs with a V(λ) corrected photometer because the measured luminance may correlate poorly with perceived brightness.</abstract>', '<title>Technical and operational users\' opinions of a handheld device to detect directed energy</title> <abstract>Introduction: Lasers, a form of directed energy (DE), are a threat to pilots and Air Force personnel.

Both groups completed the same Q-sort of both operational and equipment concerns. Results: Six opinion sets regarding operational concerns described 61% of the total variation in perceptions among participants. The factors were: concern over health effects, implications to individuals, combat/tactical concerns, force health protection, and theater/tactical concerns. Five opinion sets described 68% of the variation in the equipment functions perceived as most important. The participants indicated that ideally the device should measure exposure, enhance laser detection/ response, support night vision and ease of use, detect threats, and enhance combat medicine.

In summary, the Air Force novice nurse to a CCU area can be an equally contributory member on the Health Care Team if not compelled to place an exaggerated amount of attention on equipment, but focus more on the patient, leaving more technical learning until she becomes more aware of the unit administration and has the opportunity to attend a coronary training course.</abstract>"", ""<title>Psychological considerations with patients on respirators</title> <abstract>Illness is a subjective experience for patients and, as such, responses to illness are as varied as the patients' personalities. Special psychological considerations are necessary when delivering care to patients on respirators since they, more than others, are dependent upon people and machines for each breath of life. Providing active psychological support systems requires an awareness of the Intensive Care Unit environment, patients responses to illness and the environment, and implementation of appropriate psychological intervention. This paper reviews and discusses: the ambivalent feelings produced by the ICU environment, emotional responses of patients, complications that result from psychological responses to respirators and their management, the psychological aspects of weaning patients from respirators, the application of specific direct and indirect psychological interventions, and implications of these psychological considerations for patients being transported on respirators via aeromedical evacuation systems.</abstract>""]"

We evaluated 2,208 voluntary incident reports from commercial European pilots using qualitatively driven mixed methods to investigate LFI bottlenecks. The results showed that the report frequency depends on the type of pilots active failure causing the incident (performance-based errors, judgment and decision-making errors and violations). Learning opportunities were lacking, especially for incidents caused by pilots inadequate decision-making. Confidential reporting has positive effects on LFI, as these reports contained more information about latent failures. Furthermore, we identified several latent failures that are risk factors for certain unsafe acts. Our results may support airlines in various LFI activities. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>', '<title>Barriers and Facilitators to Voluntary Reporting and Their Impact on Safety Culture</title> <abstract>Objective: Determine barriers and facilitators to effective voluntary reporting system (VRS) operation. Background: As human error accounts for a larger portion of accidents and incidents in high-risk industries, federal agencies that define regulations and guidelines promote various safety management techniques, including more robust safety data collection. VRSs aim to identify and address “near misses” (errors identified before resulting in negative outcomes) through employee disclosure of committed errors and violations. Despite their value, VRSs are underutilized. Method: A literature review was conducted to understand successful safety management practices and challenges, and define reporting requirements for accidents, incidents, and near misses (which rely on voluntary disclosure). Variations in the policies, processes, and utility of several VRSs were explored, and common themes were identified. Interviews were then conducted with VRS developers, users, and managers to further explore these themes. Results: The literature review narrowed the focus to confidential, nonpunitive VRSs for process and product safety concerns, such as the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). Common themes exposed 8 categories of barriers and facilitators to effective VRS operation, participation, and use of report data. The literature review verified and elaborated on these barriers, and offered solutions (facilitators) based on personal observations and experiences. Conclusion: Consistent themes associated with effective and ineffective VRS operation can be used to improve VRS participation and the effectiveness of error prediction and prevention capabilities. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Why Commercial Pilots Voluntarily Report Self-Inflicted Incidents: A Qualitative Study with Aviation Safety Experts</title> <abstract>Voluntary incident reports by commercial pilots provide essential data for airline efforts in learning from incidents (LFI). Because LFI is frequently limited by pilots not reporting incidents voluntarily, we interviewed seven commercial aviation safety experts in a focus group to derive factors influencing the voluntary reporting behavior of pilots' self-inflicted incidents. As a result, we derived 36 factors and integrated them into a motivational framework by van den Broeck et al. (2019). Pilots pursue various goals when voluntarily reporting incidents, such as enabling safetyrelated change or organizational learning. This behavior is influenced by personal antecedents, such as shame, and contextual antecedents, such as feedback. Our work expands the understanding of motivational aspects of voluntary incident reporting and discusses practical interrelations. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"", '<title>The attributes of medical event-reporting systems: Experience with a prototype medical event-reporting system for transfusion medicine</title> <abstract>Objective. - To design, develop, and implement a prototype medical event-reporting system for use in transfusion medicine to improve transfusion safety by studying incidents and errors. Methods. - The IDEALS concept of design was used to identify specifications for the event-reporting system, and a Delphi and subsequent nominal group technique meetings were used to reach consensus on the development of the system. An interdisciplinary panel of experts from aviation safety, nuclear power, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and education and representatives of major transfusion medicine organizations participated in the development process. Setting. - Three blood centers and three hospitals transfusion services implemented the reporting system. Results. - A working prototype event- reporting system was recommended and implemented. The system has seven components: detection, selection, description, classification, computation, interpretation, and local evaluation. Its unique features include no-fault reporting initiated by the individual discovering the event, who submits a report that is investigated by local quality assurance personnel and forwarded to a nonregulatory central system for computation and interpretation. Conclusions. - An event-reporting system incorporated into present quality assurance and risk management efforts can help organizations address system structural and procedural weakness where the potential for errors can adversely affect health care outcomes. Input from the end users of the system as well as from external experts should enable this reporting system to serve as a useful model for others who may develop event-reporting systems in other medical domains.</abstract>']"
