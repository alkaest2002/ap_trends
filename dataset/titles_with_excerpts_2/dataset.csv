The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions.</excerpt>"

However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (eg, tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems.</excerpt>"

In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well.</excerpt>"

Vital services such as police, ambulance, hospitals, electricity must be maintained 24 hours a day; expensive equipment is more profitable if used continuously; machinery such as furnaces may be damaged if shut down.Work patterns which conflict with our circadian rhythms may produce fatigue, a tendency to make errors, accident-proneness, 'jet-lag' and perhaps ill health.Those most at risk are shiftworkers and aircrew: whilst the latter must cope with changing shift patterns and time-zone changes, the former are required to adapt to changes in work/sleep patterns against an environmental background disruptive to such an adaptation.More difficulties arise when we consider those with chronic health problems since employees on long-term medication may not be able to reconcile an unvarying drug regimen to an ever-changing work pattern.</excerpt>"
