This technique is based on the complex analysis of subjective and objective estimations of the current psychoemotional state and physiological and biochemical indices. We analyzed the data obtained during the examination of three healthy volunteers, who participated in the HUBES experiment (135-day isolation in the ground-based model of the orbital station ""Mir""), and during a biorhythmological study conducted by six Russian cosmonauts of the main expeditions on the station ""Mir.""

This study will explore the change in Chute use before and after 2012 to better understand factors that increased usage and improved accident outcomes. Methods: Using the public National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database from January 1, 2001, through August 31, 2018, a regression model was developed to identify factors that may predict Chute use. Results: In accidents occurring after January 1, 2013, pilots were 5 times more likely to use the Chute, while 2.9 times less likely to use the Chute when the accident involved pilot-related causes.</excerpt>', ""<title>Third-culture kid pilots and multi-cultural identity efects on pilots' attitudes</title> <excerpt>IP: 103.3.231.66 On: Thu, 09 Jan 2020 04:17:02 Copyright: Aerospace Medical Association BACKGROUND: Current attempts to culturally tailor human factors training in aviation segregates cultural identities based on geopoliti- cal, passport nationality, and is therefore poorly suited for (adult) 'Third Culture Kids' (TCKs) whose cross-cultural upbringing has led to the development of multicultural individual identities that do not relect their passport nationali- ties. In this study, respondents' self-categorization of personal cultural identity, as opposed to passport nationality, was used to determine whether there were cultural diferences in airline pilots' behaviors. METHOD: A survey with items imported from established scales was distributed to pilots of an international airline to measure pilots' work values, light management attitudes, and cultural dimensions, with respondents segregated into Western, TCK, or Asian cultural groups.</excerpt>"", ""<title>The “Break-Off” Phenomenon: A Precipitant of Anxiety in Jet Aviators</title> <excerpt>Icarus, flushed with excitement and exhilaration, soared even higher toward the sun—despite the cries and warnings of his father.

This leaves little room for learning about how human roles have shifted in automated cockpits or how the distinction between technical and nontechnical skills has become blurred when managing the flight path of an automated aircraft.

Design/methodology/approach: To speak about the question of “spaces” and especially spaces in the design process, this paper is focussed on the transdisciplinary design research for commercial airline pilots.

However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (eg, tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.Conclusion: We found that while pilots' instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation..</excerpt>"", '<title>Anthropomorphic AI: Sociopathic AI Features as Predictors of Career Opportunities and Threats Perceived by Pilots in Commercial Aviation</title> <excerpt>Objective: The study aims to investigate how anthropomorphic, particularly sociopathic, features ascribed to AI affect commercial pilots’ perceptions of career threats, opportunities, and performance benefits of AI integration in the cockpit.

Background: Although the effects of conflict geometry have been well documented in previous literature, empirical evidence on the influence of conflict geometry on the operator’s workload, maneuver choice, and success is still lacking.

To understand the potential workload implications of introducing advisory conflict-detection and resolution tools, this paper examines a metric of controller taskload: how many resolution commands an air traffic controller issues under the guidance of an advisory system. Through a simulation study, the research presented here evaluates how the underlying protocol of a conflict-resolution tool affects the controller taskload (system demands) associated with the conflict-resolution process, and implicitly the controller workload (physical and psychological demands).</excerpt>', '<title>Hierarchical conflict detection in air traffic control</title> <excerpt>Experienced air traffic controllers and naïve college students participated in 2 experiments we conducted to test a hypothesis that controllers evaluate potential conflicts between aircraft in a hierarchical manner, comparing altitudes first for vertical separation, then extrapolating aircraft trajectories for lateral separation, and finally performing speed-distance computations for longitudinal separation. The results clearly support the hypothesis and imply that controller workload in terms of time pressure could be determined by momentary conflict geometries between aircraft pairs in a sector. Similarity of results between the groups has implications on both our understanding of controller expertise and on experimental research on air traffic control-related issues.</excerpt>']"

In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking.</excerpt>', '<title>Multisensory Cues for Encoding Urgency of System Hazards: Effect of Operator Experience on Perceived Urgency</title> <excerpt>Objective: This study evaluated sonification and tactification for encoding urgency of system health status presented in the ground control station (GCS) visual interface of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and the observer’s perception of urgency.
