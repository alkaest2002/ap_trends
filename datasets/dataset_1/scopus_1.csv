A validation sample of 603 ATCO trainees was used to analyze the selection and training data. Cognitive performance was predictive of IT criteria and work sample performance was predictive of both IT and UT criteria. Final selection board assessments showed predictive validity for training criteria. Overall, the validity of the DLR selection procedure was confirmed. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.","air traffic controller; selection; training; validation study; validity",""
"The Invisible Copilot?: Assessing Task Engagement and Team Dynamics in a Virtual Flight Environment Using Eye-Tracking Metrics","2025","Aviation Psychology and Applied Human Factors","10.1027/2192-0923/a000293","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009402584&doi=10.1027%2F2192-0923%2Fa000293&partnerID=40&md5=2d4e97a65dbe433dac806bbcd66412b8","Gaze behavior represents a vital predictor of flight performance in pilots operating an aircraft. However, its role in collaborative settings with a copilot has been largely disregarded. Our study addressed this gap by simulating a flight environment with role division into a pilot flying (PF) and pilot monitoring (PM). Analyses of linear mixed-effects models revealed that different eye-tracking metrics significantly differed between the PF and the PM. Additionally, classification analysis revealed that these eye-tracking metrices were suitable for discerning between PF and PM with high predictive accuracy (97%) and precision (97%). We discuss implications for a role-based user state diagnosis for adaptive assistance system design in the cockpit, thereby advancing aviation safety. © 2025 The Author(s).","adaptive assistance; eye-tracking; multitasking; team work",""

The study involved 90 military aviators who participated in a United Nations-led peacekeeping mission. We used an experimental design in which participants performed BART tasks distributed differently in the experimental groups to change the risk-taking behavior. After three stages, our results showed that the values of the indicator measuring risk-taking behavior were reduced in the low-anchor experimental group when operating in conditions of uncertainty. This indicator is influenced, in risk conditions, by both motor impulsivity and anchoring bias. Impulsivity is moderately associated with risk-taking behavior. The results also show that Big Five personality factors are not significantly associated with risk-taking behavior. In conclusion, these results confirm the role of the anchoring mechanism in changing risk-taking behavior and verify the strong relationship between impulsivity and risk behavior when individuals act in risky conditions. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.","anchoring; BART tasks; behavior change; impulsivity; risk-taking; uncertainty",""

According to statistics, 75% of incidents negatively impacting flight safety have been caused by human error. This article analyzes the admission process to aircraft piloting studies, which has remained unchanged over the last decade. Background: Various research results show variability between different generations’ abilities and achievements. It is unclear what differences emerge during the selection process to aircraft piloting studies. Methods: The admission process to aircraft piloting studies involves selecting the most capable young people between 18 and 20 years of age who have completed their secondary education and demonstrate that they possess the required abilities for such studies. Results: The tasks of the selection process are divided into four factors with the help of exploratory factor analysis–Initial information processing, 3D perception, 2D perception, and Level of analysis. The period analyzed includes representatives of Generation Y and Generation Z. The study results revealed statistically significant differences in the performance of the two generations. The results indicate that technology has a significant influence on the abilities of the candidates. Conclusions: Generation Y representatives excel in concentration and logical thinking, making fewer errors in such tasks. However, they demonstrate weaker performance in spatial thinking tasks. Conversely, Generation Z representatives outperform the former in spatial thinking and sequence arrangement tasks. However, they are prone to making more errors in tasks that demand high concentration and attention. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Although technology has long been an irreplaceable, valuable ally for airline pilots, artificial intelligence (AI) differs significantly from previously used technologies and pilots perceive AI not only as a tool but as an agent with human-like attributes. These anthropomorphic perceptions shape their career-related attitudes, especially as AI’s cognitive capabilities and ethical limitations challenge pilot identity. Methods: Survey data were collected from 363 commercial pilots and measures included anthropomorphic features ascribed to AI (including sociopathic AI features), perceived career threats and opportunities as well as expected performance enhancement due to AI. Regression and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. Background: Sociopathic AI features were positively associated with career threats and negatively with opportunities. Career opportunities significantly mediated the relationship between sociopathic features and perceived performance gains. Perceived career threats related to AI reduced performance expectations due to AI only when perceived career opportunities were low. Conclusions: The study offers a broad perspective on introducing artificial intelligence into the cockpit, considering commercial pilots' tendency to anthropomorphise AI. It seeks to ensure that AI can deliver operational benefits in safety and performance that meet the industry's and its end-users' needs, therefore addressing ethical concerns is critical for AI integration in aviation. © 2025 The Author(s).

Background: Building on previous research that underscores the importance of situational awareness in aviation, this work delves into the specific aspects of gaze behavior as indicators of cognitive workload and attentional distribution. Unlike prior studies that broadly assessed attentional markers, this research utilizes advanced iris tracking technology to pinpoint how gaze metrics correlate with flight performance. Method: Employing a quantitative research design, the study analyzed over 45 simulated instrument flight approaches conducted by 15 pilots. Detailed metrics of gaze behavior, including fixation duration, saccade rate, scanning patterns, and gaze variability, were captured using iris tracking technology. A novel metric, exceedance autocorrelation, was introduced to assess aircraft control deviations and pilot performance. Results: Statistical analyses uncovered significant correlations: fixation duration exhibited a strong positive correlation with control quality (r = 0.684), and saccade rate correlated even more strongly (r = 0.827). Conversely, scan pattern predictability and gaze variability correlated negatively (r = −0.55) and positively (r = 0.546), respectively, highlighting their relevance under high cognitive workload conditions.

Method: The three-part study consisted of archival analysis of 47 accidents and 237 incident involving small single-pilot jets, subject matter expert (SME) interviews and an opinion survey of one hundred airline pilots. The multi-method approach provided holistic, complementary data, enabling findings to be triangulated. Results: Results identified the human factors hazards were mainly associated with the absence of a second crew member, specifically for: monitoring, workload management; situational awareness and verifying decision-making. SiPO acceptance was generally low amongst the airline pilot community. SJ pilots and airliner pilots favored a system configuration based around high levels of automation/autonomy rather than the displacement of the second pilot to the ground with on-demand availability (a distributed air/ground socio-technical system). Conclusion: In addition to the development of enabling technologies fundamental for de-crewing the need for further research into the design and development of single-pilot resource management (SRM) courses and definition of minimum flight experience for SiPO was recommended. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Affect and Performance in Simulated Flying Tasks: A Systematic Literature Review","2025","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2024.2425856","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001081762&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2024.2425856&partnerID=40&md5=b791417f85d3e477a772cec16e52bbd8","Objective: This systematic review explores the relationship between affect and performance during flight simulations in the context of training using simulated flying tasks. Background: A goal of human factors is to understand pilots’ psychological processing to reduce human error. Psychological insights have mainly focused on cognition, whereas recent approaches suggest that affective responses (stress and emotions) can impact performance accuracy. This is the first literature review exploring affect and performance in simulated flying tasks. Method: Following the PRISMA framework, a systematic review was conducted, resulting in 29 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Results: Studies were grouped in themes according to the manner they contributed to our objective. Findings revealed that: 1) affect and flying performance are continuous processes that need to use continuous and noninvasive measurements; 2) negative-activating affect (stress and anxiety) tend to be detrimental for flight performance; 3) pilot–copilot and pilot–instructor interactions induce affect in simulated flight; 4) unusual flying scenarios induce negative and activating affective responses and decrease performance accuracy; 5) interventions are successful for pilots to manage performance and affect. Conclusion: This systematic review demonstrates the relationships between affect and performance. The main connection is that unpredicted and intense affective reactions can distract pilots, resulting in errors. Simulations can induce authentic affective reactions, allowing pilot trainees to familiarize themselves with their reactions, and regulate themselves, to achieve successful performance. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Specifically, the consumer adoption process and the norm activation model are incorporated as the overarching theoretical model in consideration of the relative advantages of urban air mobility. Background: Urban air mobility, the next generation urban transport system, is all set to fly. Urban air mobility is a notable disruptive innovation in aviation and mobility system as a sustainable means of transportation. Method: Using a quantitative procedure, we developed the theoretical framework based on the existing theories and examined hypotheses using structural equation modeling and invariance test. Results: The findings indicate that the adoption intention toward urban air mobility is driven by problem recognition, awareness, interest, evaluation, ascribed responsibility, and personal norms. In addition, the relative advantage of urban air mobility moderates the relationships between interest and evaluation, and between ascribed responsibility and personal norms. Conclusion: Based on the empirical evidence, this study discusses the findings and subsequent implications for academia.

The similarity of two tests designed using two theories was examined. Background: Distinctions between tests of general cognitive ability (g) versus specific abilities (s) have been investigated for over a century. The Multidimensional Aptitude Battery used the individual differences psychometric approach while the MicroCog used a brain-behavior relationships approach. The authors of the tests claim they measure differing constructs based on differing theories; individual differences versus brain-behavior relations. Methods: Both tests were administered to 10,612 participants. Correlations suggested the tests shared a common source of variance for the constructs measured. Confirmatory factor analyses established this and established a hierarchical structure with g at the apex. The test designed to measure specific abilities (MicroCog) measured a single factor, g. Results: Although different theories underlie their respective construction methods, results indicated the two tests measured much in common; that is, two theories, one outcome. Conclusions: Despite the assertions of the publishers of the two tests of differences, practitioners gain little by using both tests as they both measure the same constructs. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

In a flight simulator study involving 10 participants in a generic jet cockpit, we compared the adaptive alerting system with a no-assistance condition. Although alerting improved the participants' performance in two tracking tasks, it adversely impacted performance in a third task. Nonetheless, alerting resulted in a decrease in both variance and mean detection time of critical changes. Participants' subjective ratings were generally positive, yet they criticized the lack of transparency of the alerting mechanism. Alerts triggered based on eye-tracking and system state show potential for improving operator task performance.

Background: Flight attendants in the airline industry have a differentiated work environment in stressful and demanding situations. The literature has highlighted the prevalence of mental health disorders among flight attendants. Methods: Non-experimental, quantitative research findings from a sample of 384 flight attendants from five airlines in Iran, based on structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, provide support for the hypotheses. Results: The SEM findings revealed that both PsyCap and organizational justice can enhance flight attendant mental health. As expected, mental health improved job performance. Consistent with the study’s predictions, mental health mediated the effects of PsyCap and organizational justice on job performance. Conclusions: This study empirically linked PsyCap and organizational justice to flight attendant perceptions of mental health and job performance. The research findings support the notion that strengthening flight attendant PsyCap and enhancing perceptions of organizational justice can improve performance by improving mental health. These findings have theoretical and practical implications.

Background: Trust is one critical factor that influences successful human-automation interaction. In the previous research, operators reported lower trust scores and made fewer fixation toward an automated system, which assisted a task, when competing task in the same workspace demanded more attention from the operator. However, it is unclear whether human-automation trust is influenced by frequent shift of attention away from a task assisted by an automated signaling system. Methods: Participants concurrently performed a tracking task, a system monitoring task, and a communication task. An automated signaling system was employed to assist the system monitoring task with 70% reliability. Task load was manipulated by the difficulty of the tracking task while interruption load was manipulated by the varying the frequency of auditory messages in the communication task. Results: Results demonstrated an effect of task load on human-automation trust and resource allocation, replicating previous findings. Further, participants responded faster to an auditory message that occurred less frequently when performing a tracking task at the low difficulty level but automation trust did not vary. Conclusion: While operators reported higher trust levels to imperfect automation under lower task load, number of interrupting events does not influence their trust. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Several factors such as cognitive ability, personality, and demographic information are discussed to be associated with performance in basic flight simulators. Many commercial flight operations tend to refrain from using flight simulators in the selection of ab initio pilot candidates in favor of less expensive test batteries. Method: Study 1 uses 4,340 candidates in the selection of major European airlines to investigate the factors influencing performance in the basic flight simulator. Study 2 then uses 1,753 candidates to evaluate the incremental validity of the basic flight simulator in predicting issues in flight training. Results: Multiple task ability, gender, and previous flight experience are the strongest predictors of performance in the basic flight simulator. Still, the flight simulator shows significant incremental validity in predicting problems in flight training. Conclusion: These findings seem to justify the additional use of a basic flight simulator in the selection of ab initio pilot candidates.

Method: This was a single-subject changing criterion design with six participants. Three target vowels and one control vowel were selected for each participant. Mono and bi-syllabic target words were selected from aviation textbooks recommended by the flight academy. Visual feedback and placement cues were provided to assist with each participant’s vowel productions. The Pierson Aviation English Questionnaire (PAEQ), a pre- and post-measure, was also administered. Results: All participants demonstrated gains in PVC at the three levels of difficulty. Participants reported decreased anxiety levels when speaking with native speakers, air traffic controllers, and flight instructors. All pilot candidates reported increased self-confidence levels when using aviation phraseology and an increase in enjoyment when speaking English. Conclusion: This investigation was the first of its kind to evaluate the effectiveness of vowel-centered accent modification in pilot candidates. It was also the first investigation to demonstrate the usefulness of skilled speech-language pathology intervention and the positive effect on improving intelligibility of second-language English speakers in aviation. © 2024 Katie R.

"Effects of Aerobic Capacity on Cognitive Functions During Hypoxia","2024","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2023.2281419","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178196184&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2023.2281419&partnerID=40&md5=318d8dbf8363fe17620609c0666da7d6","Objective: We aimed to investigate the role of aerobic capacity on cognitive functions during hypoxic conditions. Background: Possessing a mishap risk in aviation, acute hypobaric hypoxia has some negative effects on cognitive functions. Therefore, it is important to develop hypoxia tolerance to preserve the mental functions of pilots against possible hypoxic conditions during flight. Method: A total of 25 pilot candidates were included in this study. The subjects were dichotomized into two groups as high-fit and low-fit according to aerobic capacities. Hypoxia was applied at an altitude equivalent pressure of 18,000 ft. Go/NoGo and Digit Span cognitive tests were applied in two phases before hypoxia training and during hypoxia. Results: In the low-fit group, for the Go/NoGo test parameters, the mean R-Go reaction time increased significantly during hypoxia when compared to before hypoxia training. Additionally, in the low-fit group for the Digit Span test parameters, the memory span and the sum of correct answers both decreased significantly during hypoxia. In the high-fit group, there was no significant difference between the two test parameters during hypoxia. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that physical fitness has a positive effect on the deterioration of cognitive functions during hypoxia. It could be useful to suggest regular physical exercise habits for aircrews to increase their acute hypoxia tolerance in terms of cognitive function. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"Are Peer Support Programs Effective in the Detection and Prevention of Mental Health Issues in Commercial Aviation?","2024","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2023.2278670","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176744596&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2023.2278670&partnerID=40&md5=eea5ce02d7020a9ad5116fb28bc42d23","Background: In the aftermath of the Germanwings crash in 2015, several regulations have been instituted around pilots’ mental health issues and flight safety. One of these (CAT.GEN.MPA.215) stipulates that European operators are to implement a Peer Support Program to encourage pilots’ self-referral of mental health issues and identify mental wellbeing issues as early as possible. However, knowledge is scarce regarding how effective these programs are on a range of outcomes. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify articles investigating peer support programs and their effectiveness in preventing and detecting mental health issues, in commercial aviation and other high-risk organizations. Method: A systematic search was performed in three databases, following the structure of the PRISMA guidelines. All articles (2.123) were exported to Rayyan Citation, where the screening process was performed. Results: Four articles met the final inclusion criteria. Overall, the search revealed little empirical evidence of the effectiveness of peer support in detecting and preventing mental health. Conclusion: Although there is limited or no evidence in any direction, the peer support programs seem to be without evident harm and were generally appreciated. The insufficient empirical evidence is nonetheless concerning, with these programs being implemented throughout Europe in such a high-risk context as the aviation industry. The results highlight the importance of more research on peer support in aviation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Background: Self-efficacy and safety climate are essential for the flight performance of pilots. However, the effect of self-control on flight performance has yet to be studied. In addition, high self-efficacy is always determined as an essential risk for aviation, but this reality has yet to be researched regarding the safety climate. Method: This study employs qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Data are obtained from 244 pilot candidates training in flight schools in Turkey and then analyzed. Results: There is a significant relationship between self-perceptions and flight performance of pilot candidates. Safety climate has a moderator role in the relationship between self-efficacy, self-control, and flight performance. In the second research model, it is determined that there is a significant relationship between safety climate and flight performance. Self-control and self-efficacy of pilot candidates moderate this relationship. Conclusion: Flight schools and airline companies should exert more effort to establish a safety culture within their institutions, particularly for individuals with excessive levels of self-efficacy. Excessive self-efficacy poses a significant potential risk for those who need to perceive safety culture more in their flight school. In addition, the pilot candidates’ self-control level should be considered necessary when recruiting them. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In this study, the meaning of what senior managers’ believe support to safety management means was examined and the components of this support were identified. The qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews from 21 Safety Management System and Compliance Monitoring managers working in Turkish aviation organizations. This qualitative data was then analyzed using the inductive thematic analysis method in the NVivo 10.0 Program. The following six components of senior management’s support for safety management were revealed: 1- Demonstrating Effective Safety Leadership, 2- Carrying Out Safety Related Planning Activities, 3- Providing Adequate Resources, 4- Controlling Safety Performance, 5- Strengthening Positive Safety Culture, and 6- Coordinating with Stakeholders. According to the participants, Having a High Safety Commitment, Being Convincing and Building Trust, and Encouraging Other Managers are the most important support components. Allocating necessary financial resources to safety management and strengthening positive reporting culture are also important support indicators. Additionally, it was found that strategic management in aviation organizations should include safety management.

To realize alternations in technicians’ cognition and habit in executing routine checks is vital to identify and set training principles during starting stages of type changes. Method: This study compiled possible alterations for A350XWB maintenance from senior practitioners and then conducted a comprehensive survey of China Airlines A-check crew members. A ranked pair-wise comparison (RPC) approach distinguished the priorities of gaps in crew cognition differences and habit changes. Results: Fuselage anti-collision regulation resulted in larger gaps in cognition and habits. Procedures for powering the electrical system on and off, concepts for fuselage structure and materials, and reports of visual inspection procedures after collisions were the sub-criteria with the most significant changes for all respondents. Senior technicians presented more significant cognition differences with juniors in regulations for safety ranges between ground equipment and fuselage. Crew accumulating specific working experience performed more cautiously and carefully. Conclusion: New knowledge and procedures generated alternations of the crew’s cognition and habit in implementing A350XWB A-checks than previous types.

Background: The FAS measures the anxiety levels in different flight situations, while FAM assesses the somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety or anticipatory anxiety in different flight situations. The FAS and the FAM have been adapted to different cultures and used in different studies. Method: 645 adults from different regions of Turkey participated in this study (M<inf>age</inf> = 25.58, SD<inf>age</inf> = 10.43, 59.2% women). A Socio-demographic Information Form, the Visual Analog Flight Anxiety Scale (VAFAS), the FAS, the FAM and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used for data collection. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed that the Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM had similar factor structures to the original forms. The FAS consisted of three factors and the FAM consisted of two factors with factor loadings between.56 and.85. High Cronbach’s alpha scores (.78–.97) of the FAS, the FAM and their subscales supported internal consistency reliability. Convergent and discriminant validity of the scales were supported with correlation analysis and independent samples t-test.

Background: Unauthorized entry onto an active runway, referred to as a “runway incursion” continues to present a safety risk in aviation. It is important to understand the cause of runway incursions and the underlying factors of why pilots commit runway incursions from a human factor perspective. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize and summarize the relevant findings from previous studies. Literature searches were conducted through eight databases with an emphasis on studies that identify causal factors related to pilot behavior. Results: Limited publications on the analysis of pilot-related contributing factors of runway incursions were identified from 1985 to 2021. Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The review uncovered the common types of RIs, and the leading contributing factors associated with pilot error, such as miscommunication and loss of situational awareness.

Background: LVC technology is maturing but its expected training value is under-investigated, especially regarding future LVC in LFEs. Method: Fighter pilots at a Live-flying LFE answered questionnaires, 120 responses were analyzed statistically. The questions focused on whether the sortie they just flew provided training value, generally and for specific Desired Learning Objectives (DLOs), on whether the inclusion of Virtual and Constructive entities in future LFEs would contribute to training value generally and to the DLOs specifically, and on specific LVC implementation issues. Results: Ratings of experienced training value varied across DLOs, and DLO ratings varied across Mission types. Fighter pilots were positive toward including Virtual and Constructive entities in LFEs for certain DLOs, mostly for flying a complex mission. DLOs covaried around the factors of LVC-tradeoff advantages and Live advantages, as well as temporal dimensions of planning before a mission and stages of engagement. LVC implementation lessons were extracted. Conclusion: Fighter pilots are generally moderately positive about LVC in LFEs. The measurement of perceived training value per DLO seems a relevant instrument for investigating perceived training value of an LFE and expected training value of future LVC training. © 2023 Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI.

Evidence from a series of scenario-based tasks suggests that the perceived risks and benefits of the technology were associated with pilot affect, whereby positive feelings toward a given technology were associated with a lower perceived risk, such as accidentally flying into adverse weather, and higher perceived benefits, such as helping to maintain control while completing concurrent tasks. Findings also suggest that affect and perceived risks can be manipulated by negatively framed prior information.

The “immediate-response” group was presented with paused situations and had to recover immediately after unpausing. In a surprising transfer test, the pilots in the delayed-response group showed less aggressive unloading, and experienced significantly more time pressure compared to the pilots in the immediate-response group. In a stall cue recognition test, the delayed-response group performed nearly significantly better.

Agreement between experts was substantial across these types of media. The remaining sources of disagreement were found to be of little practical relevance during real-world application of the aerotowing taxonomy. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.","aerotowing; glider flight operations; inter-rater agreement; phase of flight; towplane",""

It is critical to draw flight passengers attention and help them be aware of the importance of safety instructions. A total of 46 simulations were conducted to collect participants performance and annoyance when hearing auditory cues. The findings demonstrated that passengers performed significantly better when hearing the intensive auditory cues with moderately high perceived urgency levels (PULs), whereas a low or an exceedingly high PUL of auditory cues impaired their performance. Participants also reported significantly higher annoyance with more intensive auditory cues. The current study suggested that the manipulation of PULs of auditory cues could improve passengers safety. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.","auditory displays; flight passenger; risk assessment; warning compliance",""

Background: There is little research into the human factors of HEMS operations. Weather, fuel planning, fatigue, and pressure are prominent human factors found in HEMS operations globally. Method: The research methodology involves primary data through a tailored human factors survey of HEMS staff in Australia, and secondary data from historical ATSB (Australian Transport Safety Bureau) accident reports involving HEMS operations. Results: Results from a survey, as well as secondary data, show that Australian HEMS is in line with global trends, regularly encounter issues related to weather, fatigue and feelings of pressure. Weather factors were the most encountered event by most Australian HEMS crews surveyed. The likelihood of an individual committing an error or violation was increased when they felt pressure to complete the task. The cause of the pressure was found to be unique to HEMS operations with the condition of the patient being the most common. However, the source of the pressure was equally attributed to self-imposed pressure and pressure imposed by others.

Background: Covid-19 restriction measures severely affected the aviation sector leading air traffic controllers to face periodic fluctuations in air traffic volume. Despite their key role in ensuring the efficiency and safety of air traffic management, little is known about the psychological issues faced by air traffic controllers during the pandemic. Method: A total of 168 Italian air traffic controllers completed an online self-report survey assessing workload, work-family conflict, job satisfaction, resilience, and Covid-19-related experience. Descriptive statistics and moderated mediation analyses were performed. To deepen the quantitative results, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted, and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Workload was positively related to work-family conflict which, in turn, was negatively associated with job satisfaction. Resilience buffered this association. The following six main themes emerged from the interviews: the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; double-edged job characteristics; job-related risk stressors; protective resources; work-life interface; and consequences. Conclusion: Air traffic controllers who were confronted with sudden increases in air traffic volume were more likely to experience work-family conflict and then be less satisfied with their job. However, resilience was a protective factor against lower job satisfaction under high work-family conflict levels. Qualitative results deepened these findings.

This research study utilizes HFACS to classify the ASRS safety reports to identify key indicators in General Aviation (GA) non-fatal accidents and incidents. Qualitative data analysis reveals relationships between incidents and causal factors, indicating 53% of incidents to be perceptual errors, 32% decision errors, and 26% skill-based errors. Prevalent preconditions for these errors include crew resource management (53%), physical environment (32%), and technological environment (16%).

Background: In air combat, evaluations of team performance have focused on task performance. However, both teamwork and taskwork are required for high performance output. Attempts to address taskwork and teamwork in single-seat fighter aircraft flights have mainly settled for adopting existing models of teamwork to flights. As such, they have overlooked the unique nature of teamwork in air combat. Method: Existing models of teamwork and taskwork are reviewed and a flight’s tactical decision-making is described as an input-process-output model. A model combining flight’s teamwork, taskwork, situation awareness and transactive memory is conceptualized and operation of the model is illustrated with a case study. In the case study, the model is used to provide an alternative explanation for an air combat accident. Results: The model bridges the gap between the well-established concepts of teamwork and the unique nature of air combat. It rationalizes how the mission essential competencies, situation awareness and transactive memory interact with each other, and how they impact the flight’s performance output.

Background: The captain must quickly make appropriate decisions once an aircraft faces emergency. Usually, human error is one primary cause of accidents, which inevitably affects the captain’s decision progress. Method: Ten participants carried out a standard non-normal scenario (cargo smoke). Each participant is equipped with simulation experience and executed three sessions using three different decision models: the DOGAM, DECIDE, and CLEAR. After each session, the situation awareness (SA) and perceived workload were assessed using the Situational Awareness Rating Technology (SART) and NASA-TLX. An in-depth interview was also completed to comprehend their subjective perception of decision-making. Results: Although the CLEAR outperformed the other models in SART and NASA-TLX scores, their performance regarding workload and SA was comparable. The fixing time of DOGAM was the longest, and the other two models were no significant difference. Subjectively, the DECIDE may require a high mental demand by simultaneously processing lots of information and measuring significant changes, whilst the DOGAM may encourage participants follow their own idea, promoting aggressive decisions. Conclusion: This paper clarifies the importance of incorporating decision models into the cockpit and investigates the relatively feasible decision-making model. Variation across our results illustrated applying different decision models to train pilots and solve problems is suggested, thereby improving flight safety. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Commercial head-mounted virtual reality (VR) systems offer a convenient and cost-effective alternative to existing aviation simulation (e.g., for refresher exercises). We performed pre-implementation testing of a novel aviation simulation, designed for head-mounted VR, to determine its fidelity and validity as a training device. Method: Eighteen airline pilots, with varying levels of flight experience, completed a sequence of training ‘flows.’ Self-reported measures of presence and workload and users’ perceptions of fidelity were taken. Pilots’ eye movements and performance were recorded to determine whether more experienced pilots showed distinct performance and eye gaze profiles in the simulation, as they would in the real-world. Results: Real-world expertise correlated with eye gaze patterns characterized by fewer, but longer, fixations and a scan path that was more structured and less random. Multidimensional scaling analyses also indicated differential clustering of strategies in more versus less experienced pilots. Subjective ratings of performance, however, showed little relationship with real-world expertise or eye movements. Conclusion: We adopted an evidence-based approach to assessing the fidelity and validity of a VR flight training tool. Pilot reports indicated the simulation was realistic and potentially useful for training, while direct measurement of eye movements was useful for establishing construct validity and psychological fidelity of the simulation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Background: It is thus far unclear how preparation relates to IM in real-world and high-stakes settings. This is of particular importance for the aviation industry, because numerous commercial providers offer preparation courses for selection procedures potentially impacting selection decisions. Method: We conducted a field study of high-stakes job interviews embedded in a selection procedure for airline pilots. Data from 100 interviewees was acquired. Results: The variety of preparation strategies an applicant used was positively correlated with two deceptive IM (faking) strategies in the job interview. Moreover, low effort preparation via social media and guidebooks was positively correlated with overall faking. The variety of preparation and preparation via social media were also positively correlated with honest IM. However, neither the aforementioned preparation nor IM showed significant correlations with the interview performance.

Background: Aviation accident reports often cite miscommunication as a contributing factor. Anecdotal reports from pilots, along with limited empirical studies on pilot communication, further confirm that miscommunication remains a problem. Method: Approximately 250 ATC-Pilot transmissions from each of four international airports: Kingsford Smith, Sydney, Australia (YSSY); Hong Kong International Airport (VHHH); Los Angeles International Airport, USA (KLAX); and Haneda, Tokyo, Japan (RJTT) were analyzed. Pilot communication errors were compared between the four locations based on pilot and ATC accent alignment, rate of speech, number and order of items in transmission, and politeness markers. Results: Native English-sounding pilots committed more errors than accented pilots. Alignment of pilot and ATC language background reduced communication errors, but not when native English speakers were involved. Longer messages increased the number of communication errors. Politeness markers did not affect communication and pilots committed fewer errors when the readback order was not scrambled. Conclusion: Communication errors still occur in ATC-Pilot radio communication. These errors appear more common with native English sounding pilots than accented pilots. Hence, the origin of the problem appears to stem from proficiency in the lingua franca of Aviation English, rather than with the English language. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Biomathematical fatigue models are useful tools in several aviation fatigue risk management programs that can be embedded in electronic device applications.

Integrating computational cognitive models and biomathematical fatigue models can help address these issues. Methods: Forty-four aircrew members completed the study with 10 performing 33 landings with sets of corresponding actigraph data and C-17 performance metrics. We developed a task network model of C-17 approach and landing operations and integrated biomathematical fatigue model predictions based on actigraph data from the aircrew. We then compared predictions from this integrated model with C-17 performance metrics from the missions. Results: We successfully predicted delays in setting flaps, landing gear, and engaging the speed brake. Conclusion: After further development and validation, this integrated model can be implemented within an application to provide real-time information on pilot fatigue and expected performance on specific aircraft operations. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

"The Link between Individual Predictors of Risk and Risky Flight Behavior: A Systematic Review","2023","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2022.2139700","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141447198&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2022.2139700&partnerID=40&md5=179f3978b355fbfd8ca84c9fbdf904b0","Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to highlight how pilots’ risk perception is measured, and the relationship between individual predictors of risk and risky flight behavior. Background: Risk is an intrinsic part of life with no action void of risk. Risk-taking is mediated by several factors which include age, sex, cultural background, and personality. Understanding how pilots’ risk perception is measured allows for improved understanding of pilots’ propensity to engage in risk, and for the design of training initiatives to mitigate risky behavior. Method: A systematic review was conducted to establish the link between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior. The systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines, covering the time span between 1985 and 2021. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were revealed. Results: Three of the 16 articles employed an in-situ behavioral measure for risky flight behavior. Forecasting, where an individual predicts his/her action in a particular circumstance was the most used measure to deduce pilots’ risk-taking behavior. No predictor variable reliably predicted pilots’ risky flight behavior. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the majority of research examining the relationship between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior relies on self-reported measures or scales as opposed to in-situ performance measures such as data captured during flight or in a simulator. Such performance measures are susceptible to demand characteristics. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"Towards Human Objective Real-Time Trust of Autonomy Measures for Combat Aviation","2023","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2022.2127724","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139799141&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2022.2127724&partnerID=40&md5=f509d6c4d32aab98ad30d9f803cc788c","Objective: Can objective trust indicators be measured and computed in real time in a within visual range aerial combat “dogfight” scenario consisting of a manned autonomous own-ship versus an adversary? Background: Previous research has focused on human trust of automation during simulated ground combat and human trust of civil aviation automation. Those studies largely consisted of subjective measures of trust analyzed post-hoc. Human trust of autonomy in high-risk situations such as dogfighting had not yet been studied. Method: Nine evaluation pilots participated in an experiment that consisted of nine operationally relevant live-flight vignettes during which they conducted a mission manager task while simultaneously monitoring an autonomous agent controlling their own-ship in an aerial dogfight. Eye tracking, objective real-time mental workload, and mission manager task performance were all recorded. Results: Potential indicators of trust were objectively measured in real-time as a function of autonomy disengagement, human cross-check ratio of autonomy, and real-time objective mental workload, as validated by traditional subjective trust measures. Measured trust still needs to be categorized as appropriate trust, overtrust, or undertrust in future work. Conclusion: This first-ever real-time measure of objective indicators of trust in operationally relevant live-flight paves the way for determining appropriate human trust of autonomy in high-risk situations such as dogfighting. These measures could have utility in high-risk manned-unmanned teaming applications such as working with robots and automated trading. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

However, the literature suggests that the relationship between personality and job performance is not straightforward: Correlations are found only for a limited set of personality factors, depend on job characteristics, and are at best small to moderate in size. Moreover, the relationship between personality scores and performance can be curvilinear rather than linear. This research investigates whether a personality test used for the selection of ATCOs predicts subsequent training performance. Training performance was measured in terms of instructor ratings (N = 262) and training outcome (N = 431). The rated training performance correlated positively with general self-efficacy and team orientation, and negatively with negativity and vulnerability. For some traits (i.e., general self-efficacy and rebelliousness), curvilinear relationships were found.

Background: The incident reporting system plays a key role in ensuring safety. It helps to obtain safety-related data and to eliminate unsafe situations before they turn into accidents. Keeping safety information permanently and in unchangeable form, tracking all the transactions regarding unsafe situations, and providing feedback to all parties have great importance for the efficiency of the system. Therefore, the reporting system should be designed with appropriate technology. Blockchain, a digital ledger, offers a decentralized, transparent, and flexible infrastructure for various implementation areas. As a breakthrough in software technology, blockchain significantly supports many design aspects of the incident reporting system. Method: The literature on three related areas, incident reporting, organizational memory, and blockchain technology, were reviewed. Later, the main requirements for effective safety reporting were identified. Finally, the extent to which blockchain technology meets these requirements was delineated by a proposed framework. Findings: The proposed framework mainly brings full transparency and accountability in incident analysis, increases the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism, and strengthens confidentiality.

Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background: The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method: A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results: Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board. Conclusion: PAV manufacturers, operators, and policymakers can utilize these findings to incorporate crucial design elements needed for PAVs to satisfy user expectations. These findings identify priorities that should be targeted in relative timeframes to satisfy near-term and long-term PAV users appropriately. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Autonomous Technology Adoption; Human Systems Integration; Passenger Air Vehicles; Urban Air Mobility",""

However, the significance and professionalism of civil aircraft technicians tend to be underestimated due to limited academic discussion of job-related issues. In practice, the particular job characteristics and working environment have led to various job demands and requirements for job resources, which may be related to the level of passion of the aircraft maintenance crews.

After analyzing the algorithm and identifying two of its predictions, we empirically tested them with two on-line experiments. Background: In 1983, Perrone proved that in daylight conditions it is possible to compute the descent angle using a ratio of retinal distances corresponding to the runway and surrounding context. Using the algorithm in nighttime conditions, with just the visible runway, pilots would overestimate the descent angle, leading to the BHI. Method: Mathematical analysis indicates the algorithm predicts a large BHI; perhaps too large if there are no mitigating factors. As Perrone noted, the BHI illusion magnitude should be affected by runway width; we also found that some conditions predict a reverse BHI (pilots should underestimate their descent angle). In our experiments, participants observed a cockpit view of a runway during five seconds of steady approach. In a subsequent still image, participants indicated where they believed the plane would land if it continued its flight path. We measured the accuracy of the landing positions for various runway widths and various background contexts.

"Cognitive Biases in Risk Communication during Post-Flight Debrief","2022","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2022.2086129","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132148685&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2022.2086129&partnerID=40&md5=3f9df287b237fd734b5e31d12e276506","Objective: This paper aims to identify cognitive biases in risk communication among pilots during flight debrief. We evaluate the effect of framing language, representation format, and parameter type measured on how pilots interpret flight information. Background: Advancements in technology have created an opportunity for a data-centric approach to flight instruction. The understanding of virtual debrief formats, consisting of visualizations of flight data, relies on the pilot perceiving the information displayed accurately. Cognitive biases may impact how pilots perceive the information and therefore affect how they react to it in future flights. Method: We used flight data to design ways to communicate the information and developed a display prototype for the user. We asked pilots to evaluate eight different representations through a scenario-based survey. Pilots reviewed a flight and rated how risky they thought it was and the likelihood of their debrief resulting in any behavioral changes in upcoming flights. Results: Most significantly, the graphical representation format caused pilots to report a lower risk for the same flight, compared to the numerical representation format. Conclusion: The analysis of the survey has shown that debrief representation affects risk perception, but not necessarily willingness to change unsafe behaviors. Respondents were highly motivated to change unsafe behaviors, independent of how the information was presented to them. Future work should develop specific guidelines to be followed when designing debrief products. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: The aviation industry has undergone a series of devastating changes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the implications of the pandemic on pilots’ JS are unknown. Methods: Quantitative JS measurements were taken from 203 European and Middle Eastern pilots, during the pandemic (March, 2021), using the shortened Job Descriptive Index and Job In General validated scales. Follow-up semi-structured interviews (April 2021) were conducted with 16 participants to establish pre-pandemic JS levels and identify the degree of change due to COVID-19. Results: Significant JS differences (p < .001) were observed between military and airline pilots; the former having higher levels. Qualitative findings revealed that airline pilots’ levels decreased due to factors such as job security, pay cuts, opportunities for promotion and skill-fade concerns. Military pilots experienced an increased JS, as state-funded organizations were not substantially affected by COVID-19, which led to a feeling of appreciation and thankfulness. Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to JS of military and airline pilots. Suggested mitigation measures for the civil aviation sector comprised effective communication between pilots and managers to reduce the pandemic-induced job uncertainty. Solutions such as extra flight simulator sorties were recommended to tackle the skill-fade effect. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: The perceptual-cognitive abilities required for MOT are also important for ATC performance. The current study provides a novel examination of NeuroTracker’s utility to predict novice performance on a simulated ATC task, relative to two discrete measures of working memory (WM). Method: Forty-six participants completed computer-based assessments of MOT ability (NeuroTracker) and WM (Corsi Block Tapping, Automated Operation Span) followed by the simulated ATC task. Regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between ATC task performance and the MOT and WM measures. Results: After controlling for age and video game playing, MOT ability significantly predicted more correct detections of conflicts between aircraft, fewer false alarm responses to conflicts, and faster aircraft acceptance and hand-off. When WM measures were included in regressions, MOT was a stronger predictor of performance than WM on those outcomes, and remained a statistically significant predictor of better conflict detection, false alarm response, and hand-off performance. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the relevance of MOT ability to ATC task performance and support the potential utility of NeuroTracker for controller applicant screening and selection. Research is required to validate the findings in larger and more representative samples under more realistic conditions. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: High levels of cognitive performance in pilots is required for flight safety. Methods: Students at a military flight school in Thailand were invited to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria was positive screening for caffeine use disorder. We examined three cognitive functions required for flight performance: (1) vigilance (Mackworth Clock Test), (2) situational awareness, including memory (Corsi block-tapping test) and spatial reasoning (mental rotation test), and (3) reaction time (Deary-Liewald task). Neuropsychological tasks were performed before and 30 minutes after drinking a bottle of 220 ml coffee containing 143 mg of caffeine. Sleep quality was measured by the Thai-Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Twenty-nine healthy males without caffeine use disorder with a mean age of 25.1 years were enrolled. After low-dose caffeine intake (<3 mg/kg body weight), cognitive performance improved significantly in vigilance, situation awareness, and reaction time. Baseline cognitive performance was not different between high (HSQ) and low sleep quality (LSQ) groups. After drinking coffee, however, participants with HSQ demonstrated improvements in vigilance and reaction time, while the LSQ group had improved vigilance only. Conclusion: Low dose caffeine improved vigilance, situational awareness, and reaction time which were cognitive functions required for flight performance.

Background: Risk-taking is a topic that draws attention because of its link with the causation of injury. In the literature, there are a large number of papers linking personality traits to self-reported risk-taking, in addition to theoretical commentaries. In contrast, there are very few empirical studies that examine the link between personality traits, such as risk-taking and actual risk-taking behavior. Method: One hundred university students with no flying experience (59 females) and 17 pilots (five females) completed a battery of personality and risk scales. Pilots were also tasked to complete a simulated flight involving a low-level flying task. Results: The results revealed that pilots had a higher propensity for risk than the general population. However, this risk was tempered by the personality factor of self-control. Evidence of this juxtaposed position was present during the simulated flight; pilots’ propensity for risky behavior was inversely related to actual risk-taking behavior. Conclusion: These results indicate a dichotomy in risk-takers, impetuous and calculative risk-takers.

Background: HQ evaluation of a piloted aircraft remains an elusive area of flight testing, due to the existing subjective evaluation technique for the pilot workload. The pilot control inceptor being an important interface for a pilot with the aircraft, it is the best tool to estimate pilot workload. Method: The statistical model of this research involved 3 independent variables, namely aircraft flying qualities, secondary task, and boundary effect of WBFTT, each differently affecting the pilot workload. Two studies were undertaken on a fixed-base, variable-stability HQ research flight simulator with military test pilots. In-flight study of pilot inceptor movement was undertaken in an advanced jet trainer aircraft during high pilot-gain air-to-ground target tracking tasks. Results: The results of simulator studies validated the relationships of PIW and WBFTT with statistical significance from a wide set of data, with variations in pilot workload in terms of flying qualities and secondary task. The in-flight studies validated the effects of high pilot gain and proximity to ground (boundary), on the pilot inceptor movements, in training combat maneuvers.

Background: The human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) is the first-generation empirical human reliability analysis (HRA) approach. Although this technique is used in several industries, AMTs’ errors have not been assessed with HEART and interactions of error-producing conditions (EPCs) have not been considered in calculating the probability of AMTs’ errors. Method: HHEA is proposed to reduce the subjectivity of experts’ judgments by calculating assessed proportion of affect of each EPC on human error probability (HEP) integrating HEART and the analytic network process (ANP) method. The proposed model has been applied in the maintenance of the elevator, which is one of the most important primary control surfaces for the Cessna 172 Series aircraft type. Results: The HEP values of 3 subtasks are found to be higher than the average HEP value. These subtasks have the highest probability of human error due to time pressure, poor environmental conditions, and being a repetitive task. Conclusion: This study could guide other aircraft maintenance organizations using this integration of human reliability assessment approach for critical maintenance practices to enhance flight safety and minimize human error. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Corrective feedback is primarily given verbally in flight training to facilitate trainee pilot performance. Such feedback can be provided using different vocal tones (i.e., positive, neutral, negative). How the effectiveness of the feedback varies based on changes in vocal tone remains unknown. Methods: Thirty-eight student pilots completed two simulated flights, both involving a right-hand circuit. Following the first flight, the student pilots listened to prerecorded verbal feedback in either a positive, neutral or negative tone about their flight performance, in terms of mean altitude during the downwind leg. Deviation from the target altitude during downwind in the second flight was examined. Self-efficacy and self-esteem were also measured to examine their mediating effect. Results: The results revealed that student pilots who received a positive tone of feedback performed significantly worse than pilots who received neutral or negative tones of feedback. No mediating effects were found for self-efficacy or self-esteem.

Background: In recent years the proportion of male cabin crew has increased, still few studies have investigated gender differences in PSYJS and MSP in this occupational group. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire concerning work-related psychosocial demands, control, social support, and MSP was answered by 107 male and 329 female cabin crew members from the three major airline companies in Norway. Binary logistic regression models were used for the analysis. Results: There were no gender differences in PSYJS, but female cabin crew reported higher levels of social support from colleagues (p = .001) and nearest supervisor (p = .006). Multi-site MSP was reported by 70%. No gender differences in prevalence of single-site or multi-site MSP were found, except from a higher prevalence of pain in feet in female cabin crew (p = .020). Both a high strain (33%) and a passive (17%) work situation were associated with significantly higher risks of most single and multi-site MSP.

Background: Although the effects of conflict geometry have been well documented in previous literature, empirical evidence on the influence of conflict geometry on the operator’s workload, maneuver choice, and success is still lacking. Methods: hirteen undergraduate students with air traffic control (ATC) knowledge were requested to complete ATC tasks and resolve six different conflicts that were generated by manipulating two geometric features, namely, lateral (i.e., crossing, converging, and overtaking) and vertical (i.e., level and nonlevel) conflicts. Results: Crossing (p < .01) and converging (p = .05) conflicts resulted in higher workload than overtaking conflicts because of the higher geometric dimensions involved. Workload (p < .01) and performance (p < .03) were worse during nonlevel conflicts than during level conflicts. Notably, vertical maneuver led to a higher workload than other maneuver choices despite the higher preference for this maneuver. These findings were associated with visualization load. Conclusion: We failed to confirm that the resolution maneuver was chosen because of its good performance and low workload. Instead, predetermined rules (i.e., altitude, speed, and heading) were used, regardless of the workload, and the safety of the chosen maneuver for a particular conflict geometry was verified. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: As air traffic control becomes more complex and demanding due to the increasing number of aircraft movements in major airport hubs, the need to particularly look into the interplay of performance shaping factors has also intensified. Despite the previous efforts of scholars to understand the framework of air traffic control based on factors on workload and situation awareness (SA) and its impact to shift in control strategy, the role of fatigue in such factors is ignored notwithstanding its relative impact on air traffic controllers as tasks are carried out in varying workload and work shift. Methods: A case study is conducted in an actual tower control center in the Philippines to demonstrate the hypothesized relations among fatigue, workload, SA, and control strategy. Questionnaires based on SPAM, SASHA, Samn-Perelli fatigue scale, and visual attention self-report are deployed to measure air traffic controllers’ fatigue levels, SA, and control strategy. Results: Fatigue has an inverse relationship with workload and has a significant effect on SA. Furthermore, fatigue is also found to have a significant relationship with some areas of interest including visual display terminal.

Since flight medicine is a team event, the performance-cohesion relationship is examined as a potential countermeasure against fatigue-related errors in aeromedicine. Background: Fatigue has been implicated in decision-making errors, suggesting that it impacts cognitive abilities and clinical performance. Although the impact of fatigue on medical performance in aeromedicine has yet to be examined, it is intuitive flight providers are also susceptible to fatigue-induced errors. Given the additional fatiguing effects of flight, research is needed to elucidate protective factors that can reduce the likelihood of fatigue-induced errors in flight medicine. Method: A comprehensive review of literature was conducted on the relationship between fatigue and medical performance. The multidimensional construct of team cohesion (i.e., including task and social subdimensions) was also examined to understand the potential moderating effect of team cohesion on the relationship between fatigue and error. Results: The empirical evidence on the relationship between fatigue and error is robust. Although the performance-cohesion relationship is strong, the distinctive subdimensions of team cohesion, including task and social, may differentially impact team performance. Conclusion: Whereas higher levels of social cohesion may contribute to groupthink and degradations in performance when fatigued, evidence suggests that task cohesion is an area for future investigation as a possible countermeasure against fatigue-induced errors. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: In the mathematical models developed for crew rostering problems, the fatigue level of aircrew members is evaluated only within the scope of the flight and duty time limitations defined by the civil aviation authorities. In this study, a new model is developed in which the fatigue risk factors such as the number of flight legs, additional workload, circadian rhythm, and consecutive flights are added to the crew rostering problem. Method: A linear mathematical programming model was developed for the aircrew rostering problem. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used in the solution of the model. The problem is solved and the effects of the fatigue risk factors on crew rostering problems are examined by using the weekly and monthly real flight data of a Turkish air carrier. The results obtained are demonstrated in Gantt charts. Results: Although the results obtained are within the limits of flight and duty time defined by civil aviation authorities, it is found that many flight duties exceed the limits considering the fatigue risk factors.

They must accurately assess situations, make judgments and decisions, understand cues that may not be immediately obvious, and develop effective solutions. How may we gain perspective on how UAS pilots make decisions when higher order cognitive skills are needed to solve problems and accomplish their missions? Background: Previous UAS task analyses, both behavioral and cognitive, have seldom examined experienced, high-hour UAS operators. It is important to know how these pilots address and solve problems to improve training and design. METHOD: The Applied Cognitive Task Analysis method (ACTA) was utilized to define and examine a sampling of the cognitive task requirements of operating a civilian UAS. The task analysis included sixteen UAS journeymen and expert pilots who had between 240 and 2000 + hours of experience. Tasks such as communication, search and rescue mission planning, coping with equipment malfunction, and developing situational awareness of their environment were analyzed. Result: The analysis produced six task diagrams, which identified key cognitive considerations, captured pilot insights after flying simulated missions, and documented examples where pilots used their expertise to solve operational problems.

Background: Understanding pilot factors in weather-related diversions is integral to reducing the phenomenon of visual flight rules flight into meteorological conditions. Method: Thirty-six general aviation pilots flew a cross-country flight in a Cessna 172 simulator where they encountered an ATC-directed diversion due to deteriorating weather. Path analyses quantified effects in a two-stage model based on criteria specified by aviation regulations. Results: In stage 1, low cognitive flexibility and fewer recent pilot-in-command hours were associated with greater likelihood of ignoring the diversion instruction. Low cognitive flexibility was also associated with errors in locating the alternate aerodrome and incorrect procedures at the alternate. At stage 2, there were significant positive paths from a diversion efficiency variable to all aspects of pilotage. Pilotage positively predicted awareness of ownship and traffic, and was associated with fewer altitude violations. Conclusion: We provide empirical evidence for the association between the cognitive factors related to continuation bias and high-risk responses to diversion instructions. Using a two-stage model to conceptualize pilot performance illuminates the impact of cognitive factors in weather-related diversions. Highlighting the pivotal human factors at two clear junctions of an unexpected diversion can more fully prepare pilots to safely manage these risk-laden events. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: All air transport stakeholders strive to ensure aviation’s safety and security. As key players, airlines and airports must comply with International Air Transport Association and International Civil Aviation Organization regulations, so they usually establish strict security mechanisms to prevent possible accidents resulting from passengers bringing dangerous goods on board. However, excessive or unnecessary security checks often cause inconvenience for passengers, who are dissatisfied with security checks and may be discouraged from flying again. Method: With 300 valid questionnaires collected from domestic route passengers in Taiwan, analysis of variance and structural equation modeling were conducted to explore the differences in the passengers’ awareness of dangerous goods and the impacts of security communications and awareness of dangerous goods on the satisfaction with the security checks. Results: Older and retired passengers are prone to have relatively low awareness about dangerous goods. Among the 3 types of preflight security communications, counter and website communications had stronger impacts on passengers’ satisfaction of security checks.

Background: The pre-flight safety briefing is a required presentation that must be administered to all passengers before conducting a flight. This briefing is most commonly delivered via a live demonstration by flight attendants or through the aircraft’s in-flight entertainment system, such as a seatback video. Method: Using a sample of 876 participants from the United States, we examined the influence of familiarity, anticipatory flight anxiety, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and frequency of flying on willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing. The study used a quantitative correlational design with structural equation modeling techniques for data analysis. Results: The results supported 5 of the 7 hypotheses. High levels of flight anxiety resulted in less willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing.

While similar AR use and research in university education exists, this study piloted a comparative method assessing knowledge retention and transfer. Background: AR technology is a popular tool used in technical education. But learner behaviors observed like game play and exploration during this study could impact future learning strategy design as AR use increases. Method: 36 university undergraduate students enrolled in a university aeronautical engineering technology program were divided into AR and paper-based groups and compared on first-time task execution times for starting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU).

Background: Helicopter maritime operations are challenging, especially when it comes to landing on the moving decks of small ships, such as frigates, which can lead to dramatic accidents. Method: Expert pilots were requested to fly the full ship landing maneuver from approach to touchdown in an immersive simulator. Two sea states (3 and 4 on the Douglas Sea scale) and their resulting deck movements were used. Changes in helicopter altitude were correlated with deck heave movements throughout the maneuvers in order to scrutinize the helicopter-deck coupling. The energy at impact was measured. Results: The dynamics of helicopter-deck coupling evolved through two phases during the maneuver: Initially, no coupling then, coupling in phase between the helicopter vertical displacements and deck heave displacements. Moreover, the coupling reached higher values within the last 15 m to landing, corresponding to a hover phase and touchdown, and the correlation increased with sea level. This coupling might help in improving pilots’ safety since the greater the coupling at touchdown, the lesser the kinetic energy at impact. Conclusion: Coupling the helicopter vertical displacements with ship heave movements seems to be an efficient strategy to minimize energy at impact. Questions arise on both the rationale and the perceptual invariant behind such behavior and indicate the necessity of further investigation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Pilot fatigue is a major safety concern and effective countermeasures are crucial for sustaining flight performance. Stimulants are not recommended for routine use but can help sustain alertness and flight performance when the risk of fatigue is high. However, they may also elicit side effects. It is important to fully understand the contexts in which stimulants are used, including factors that contribute to their use and how aviators perceive them. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify observational studies on stimulant use specific to aviation tasks. Results: Caffeine was frequently used in civilian aviation, though prevalence of use and perceptions about efficacy depend on task demands and individual caffeine responses. Stimulant use in military aviation was dependent on several operational factors, including the duration and timing of operations, recent hypnotic medication use, and whether other fatigue countermeasures could be utilized. Military aviators generally viewed stimulants as beneficial and side effects were sparse and mild-moderate with a few exceptions. Notably, most studies identified were published over 10 years ago. Conclusion: Stimulant use is relatively common in aviation and many (but not all) aviators perceive them as beneficial, though more studies should be conducted in the modern aviation environment.

Background: mindfulness-based training (MBT) have been used as a personal stress management tool in stressful working environments, including military aviation. There is little knowledge about the interpersonal mechanisms involved when engaging in MBT. Method: Adhering to Grounded Theory (GT), we conducted post-intervention interviews with 42 programme participants. We selected 30 interviews with evidence of interpersonal effects for in-depth analyses to build a theoretical model of the pathways through which interpersonal effects might develop. Results: The majority of the interviewees (30/42 = 71%) experienced significant interpersonal effects from MBT. The in-depth analyses revealed an increase in the common theme “Sense of Fellowship” (SOF). SOF comprised three primary change processes: “Attention to others,” “Self-observation” and “Reflection.” In addition, five behavioral changes emerged: “Direct communication,” “Increased patience,” “Decreased anger expression,” “Calmness,” and “Acceptance.” Finally, four contextual factors appeared to have particular importance for the development of SOF: “Plenary sessions,” “Sharing experiences,” “Doing something new together,” and “Sitting in silence.” Conclusion: These findings indicate that MBT has prosocial effects in a military aviation setting, and the constructed model contributes theoretically by suggesting how these psychosocial effects may arise and develop. © 2021 The Author(s).

Background: Fatigue is a pervasive safety hazard in aviation affecting several aspects of flight crew members’ ability to perform their job. Fatigue in aviation and its consequences has been researched across military and commercial operations, but until now Part 141 collegiate aviation pilots have been neglected. Method: Data were collected using an online survey questionnaire self-report questionnaire (N = 122) consisting of items investigating fatigue identification and management by Part 141 collegiate aviation pilots. Results: Sixty percent of the participants usually experience the mental and physical symptoms of fatigue during flight activities. A finding of concern was that 43% of the participants indicated they had not received any training in fatigue identification and management during ground and flight activities. Conclusion: The safety management of fatigue in a Part 141 collegiate aviation environment is a safety issue that warrants further research, and training and education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"Precautions & Possible Therapeutic Approaches of Health Hazards of Astronauts in Microgravity","2021","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2020.1863151","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099853716&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2020.1863151&partnerID=40&md5=bfaeb29d9a3ddf6c9a25aa8d4688bb0b","Objective: Astronauts deal with lots of health issues during space exploration. In this review article, we explore the health hazards of astronauts and possible therapeutic approaches or precautions they should take prior to or during space travel for relief from these health complications. Background: The space environment is very different from our planet’s environment. The major differences include radiation from high-level hazardous radioactive particles, vacuum in space, and weightlessness in microgravity. In microgravity, gravitational force decreases with distance. Astronauts deal with anticipated as well as occasional incidents during space flight due to extreme temperatures (either hot or cold), high-energy radiation, vacuum, and atomic oxygen. Method: A literature-based survey from different search engines is collected and reviewed. Results: Possible therapeutic approaches can temporarily relieve astronauts of their specific health issues. Pranayama and Yoga heal both mind and body, and prepare the body to adjust and adapt to any kind of atmospheric situation as well as climatic conditions. Practicing these techniques during their training period can be beneficial for astronauts. Conclusion: Researchers should work on alternative treatment approaches for health hazards during space flight. Effective treatment and care for astronauts, including proper nutrition and preparation of proper herbal or polyherbal formulations, should focus techniques that are beneficial for them and improve their outcomes in space exploration. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"Pilot Work Related Stress (WRS), Effects on Wellbeing and Mental Health, and Coping Methods","2021","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2020.1858714","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099479535&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2020.1858714&partnerID=40&md5=2395a00a0b3d67e35ed21d0bf2fe1476","Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between sources of work-related stress (WRS) for pilots, effects on wellbeing, and coping mechanisms. Background: Recent studies have measured depression levels in pilots but not the relationship between depression levels and coping strategies. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted with commercial pilots. A regression model was advanced to analyze the relationship between each frequency level of each coping strategy and PHQ-9 Scores, and the Odds ratio was interpreted. Results: Sources of WRS impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Not all pilots are suffering. Over half met threshold for mild depression. Nearly 60% are using coping mechanisms to manage WRS and its impact on wellbeing. Pilots using coping mechanisms such as sleep management, taking physical exercise, and diet management were found to have lower depression severity levels. The findings of this study underscore the need to advance new tools to enable pilot self-management of their health and wellbeing. This includes new training tools, enhanced checklists, and new digital tools to support wellbeing awareness, stress coping, and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit. Conclusions: Airlines and pilots need the right tools to safeguard the wellbeing and mental fitness of pilots and ensure flight safety. Pilots, airlines, and aviation regulators can learn from the existing use of coping strategies by pilots. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

We present two emblematic cases: the misattributed origin of the use of eye-tracking techniques in aviation to Paul M. Fitts and his collaborators, and the forgotten (and often reinvented) oculometer training tape technique. Background: Over the last century, military and civilian researchers have used eye-tracking techniques to solve many challenges faced by the aviation industry, from assessing new graphical displays to testing procedural trainings. Yet, these techniques have been always classified as merely promising. The difficulty of using eye trackers outside of a laboratory environment, and the labor-intensive data extraction and interpretation procedures have long been considered a barrier to implementing eye-tracking techniques in aviation settings. Method: We revised original scientific articles as well as military and civilian technical reports on the use of eye-tracking techniques in aviation settings from the beginning of Aviation Psychology. Results: A systematic failure in recognizing and learning from the pioneering works might be a concomitant explanation for classifying the use of eye-tracking techniques as merely promising. Conclusion: Taking together past and present findings, it would not be over-optimistic to state that eye-tracking finally went from being a “promising” technique in aviation to a “proven” one. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Currently, problems exist with a myriad of native language accents and phraseology interfering with cognitive reflexes especially for aircrews and air traffic controllers to safely do their work. Executives from four Brazilian airlines proactively implemented a 14-month LDP focused on English language fluency and leadership enhancements collectively for leaders within their firms. Method: Blended learning as proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization provided the experiential and heuristic framework of the LDP suitable for an empirical analysis of participants’ language and leadership improvements. Results: Research outcomes indicated Interaction Ritual Theory and Social Contagion Theory moderating entrained behaviors, emotions, and modes of LDP participants, upskilling their English language fluency and leadership competencies. LDP participants with no prior relationships progressed through the LDP wholly as a collective group prioritizing their language and leadership proficiencies. Conclusion: Optimization of English language fluency for aviation leaders can be accomplished in a lengthy customized leadership development program. Upskilling language proficiency for leaders assists them with transferring and motivating English language knowledge and fluency to their teams and organizationally. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Pilot training has remained relatively unchanged for over thirty years. The syllabi for flight training contains little information about specific educational techniques or instructions that may assist the flight instructor in his/her role. Matching the learning style of the student, to that of the teaching style of the educator/instructor has the potential to improve learning outcomes. Method: Eighteen trainee pilots were divided into either visual or auditory learners based on the VARK learning styles model and asked to complete three test flights involving a left-hand circuit using a flight simulator. After each flight, pilots received feedback (control–no feedback, visual, auditory) about a different aspect of their flight performance (actual compared to target). Results: The results revealed when the modality in which the feedback was provided matched the preferred learning style of the pilot, improvements in performance resulted. When there was a mismatch between the two, adverse effects were evident for auditory learners only. Conclusion: From a theoretical perspective, the results provide clear evidence of the link between learning and teaching styles. From an applied perspective, these results highlight the potential benefits of aligning teaching and learning styles in flight training. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Visual functions are important for flight safety. However, the potential of perceptual learning to compensate for hypoxic vision damage is unclear. Method: Seven observers enrolled in this study and were exposed to a hypoxic (11.5% O<inf>2</inf>) and a mesopic (3 cd/m2) environment. Visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were evaluated in normoxia and hypoxia before and after the 8 daily training sessions. All observers trained in a monocular sine-wave grating detection task near their individual cutoff spatial frequencies while breathing normoxic gas. Results: The contrast sensitivity (CS) at the trained spatial frequency, the area under the log CSF (AULCSF) and VA decreased in a hypoxic environment. Additionally, all visual performances (i.e., CS, AULCSF and VA), regardless of whether they were measured in the normoxic or hypoxic condition, improved following normoxic perceptual learning. The degree of visual improvement did not differ between normoxia and hypoxia, indicating that visual improvement is completely transferable from normoxia to hypoxia. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that visual improvement remains even under environmental changes, and perceptual learning may be a noninvasive way to compensate for vision decreases in hypoxia. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Extant research exploring the effects of grading formats on evaluator performance focused on pen and paper modalities. This research investigated how a contemporary iPad-based grading format affected airline evaluator performance. Method: Forty-five evaluators from a major U.S. airline graded a Boeing 767 (Boeing is a wordmark of The Boeing Company, registered in the U.S. and other countries) flight crew experiencing an engine failure during takeoff. Three grading formats were used: pen and paper, a paper-based equivalent of the iPad grading format designed to replicate the function of the iPad, and the iPad. The effects of the grading formats were measured using the following dependent variables: recorded technical criteria, recorded non-technical criteria, and correlation and inter-rater agreement with a referent score. Results: Members of the iPad paper-based equivalent and iPad groups recorded significantly more technical and non-technical criteria compared to participants using pen and paper (p <.001). Members of the iPad paper-based equivalent and iPad groups had significantly higher correlation (p =.01) and inter-rater agreement levels (p <.01) compared to participants using pen and paper. Conclusion: The results of the study failed to support the iPad as a superior grading format. Research outcomes suggested structured grading may be a more important factor in predicting airline evaluator performance than the type of grading format used. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Pilots usually suffer stress under highly demanding conditions. This can affect performance to such an extent that the human factor is the main cause of aviation accidents. Stress has not been studied recently in student pilots. Method: We used a wristband to record in real-time the Electrodermal Activity (EDA, a reliable indicator of stress) of student pilots during several flight simulator sessions. Experienced flight instructors graded their performance during these flights. The sessions were split into different tasks to focus only on performance and EDA in Highly Demanding Tasks (HDTs). Results: We found that students have higher EDA when correctly performing an HDT. Furthermore, we observed low EDA in students who perform well on the session as a whole but perform poorly on one particular HDT. Conclusion: The study indicates that high levels of stress are related to high performance at high levels of demand. We also observe that students (although they may perform well on the session as a whole) poorly performed a highly demanding task, during which they showed low levels of stress. We suggest that this could be due to fatigue, a lack of motivation, level of skills, or even overconfidence, all of which are variables that should be assessed in future work. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: The advance of aeronautics has led to further aircraft developments, increasing heights and speeds which increase the psychophysiological demands, thus leading to greater incidence of spatial disorientation and visual illusions. Methods: 60 male pilots with large professional experience (1012 h ± 250 accumulated flying hours) between 7 and 18 years in their respective units and experience in international missions in the current conflict areas as Lebanon, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq, were subjected to a post-flight visual experience questionnaire. Results: Our findings suggest that transport pilots tend to present significant higher disorientation situations than fighter pilots, while fighter pilots presented greater sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation but experimented more visual illusions. Conclusion: These differences are related with the demands of the different aircrafts used by each pilot, thus specific, individualized and larger simulated training sessions in simulated environments are suggested. Further research should focus on the analysis of peripheral and central fatigue as constructs that may help to the appearance of greater spatial disorientation and visual illusions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Qualification processes require helicopter pilots to complete scheduled simulation training to ensure competency in areas that would otherwise be too dangerous to practice while flying the actual helicopter. Unfortunately, little is known about how effective this simulation training is in regard to cognitive and physiological responses. Methods: Ten qualified pilots completed six flight simulations while real-time eye tracking and physiological data were collected. The pilots were assigned to one of two groups based on their regular flying position (First Officer (FO) or Captain). Results: The findings indicated that there is a significant difference in maximal Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA<inf>max</inf>) and maximal heart rate (HR<inf>max</inf>) values between the two groups while completing the same in-flight emergency scenarios. Conclusions: Results suggest that FOs found the sessions more cognitively demanding and also indicated they would benefit from learning how Captains conduct their radial scan of instruments. Therefore, it is recommended that visual search patterns are included in initial training, all flight simulator training includes eye tracking, heart rate data are collected, and that future longitudinal research follows new pilots through their training/upgrading process. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: In a large majority of previous studies, parametric statistical classification methods have been commonly used for the pilot candidate selection process. These kind of methods require a representative sample with sufficient numbers of good and poor candidates to minimize the standard error associated with the regression weights and to ensure prediction accuracy. In this study, a new pilot candidate selection method has been developed, which can also be used in cases where there are not enough candidates or there is not a significant relationship between predictors. Method: The model was developed by using an analytic hierarchy process technique. A survey was conducted with airline pilots working at Turkish air carriers to determine the weights of the selection criteria considered in the model. The minimum success score of each criterion was obtained from the survey results. The analyzes are carried out using the Super Decisions program. Results: We found that the most important factor among the pilot candidate selection criteria is psychomotor coordination and operational abilities with a coefficient of 0.37306.

The objective was to assess factors that affect their job satisfaction and retention. The results will help guide development of Realistic Job Preview (RJP) videos for new recruits considering an RPA SO career. Background: Despite burgeoning demand and insufficient manning for RPAs to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities, research on the factors that contribute to operator job satisfaction and retention has been limited. Method: One hundred ten RPA SOs were surveyed to assess factors thought to affect person-job fit. Thematic content analysis by independent raters was done to provide insight into factors that (1) may make the RPA career field a good or poor fit, (2) unique challenges and rewards of the career field, (3) misconceptions about the career field, and (4) job characteristics influencing retention decisions. Results: A high level of agreement (mean Cohen’s kappa = 0.73) occurred across pairs of raters.

Background: Non-technical skills encompass the interpersonal and cognitive skills necessary for safe and efficient team performance in high-risk environments. There is a lack of research investigating non-technical skill use during helicopter flight or assessing differences in skills according to mission parameters. Method: The current study comprised 28 semi-structured qualitative interviews based upon the critical incident technique (16 offshore transport pilots, 12 search and rescue pilots). Interviews were thematically coded to identify, and compare, non-technical skills. Results: All key non-technical skills were reported across both pilot groups. Differences were identified at the element level of skills across the groups (e.g., while both groups reported utilizing situational awareness, elemental sub-components were based upon different attentional factors). A category for cognitive readiness was identified specific to search and rescue—this category encapsulated the elements necessary for a swift, effective response to emergencies. Conclusion: The results indicate helicopter pilots’ non-technical skills vary according to mission parameters, suggesting specific flight goals require different nuances of non-technical skills for mission achievement. We suggest that non-technical skills training should be tailored to the mission focus of helicopter pilots in order to further error mitigation strategies, enrich training relevance, and enhance effectiveness. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: As the demand for pilots will continue to grow significantly in the coming decades, so will the demand for CFIs, and for ways to improve their existing performance. Understanding performance factors of CFIs could benefit their training and help meet the increasing demand for pilots. Method: State-of-the-art research on the subject was surveyed via a systematic review of performance factors of CFIs and a scoping review to identify areas where other fields of research could inform CFI performance evaluation. Result: Only 20 articles since 1965 have directly assessed performance factors of CFIs. Their focus has mostly been on communication and educational processes. The scoping review brings forward concepts from cognitive psychology and psychophysiology as means of improving the current understanding of CFI situation awareness and task management. Conclusion: Very little work has been done on CFI situation awareness and task management.

Background: Effective communication can have a positive contribution to safety in the aviation maintenance industry. In concert with trust, communication can also influence the detection of failures during the practice of maintenance in a civil and military aviation environment. Method: This study explores the association between three factors: communication satisfaction, interpersonal trust and trust toward aviation maintenance maintenance software. To this end, a survey was conducted to diverse set of aviation maintenance professionals. A quantitative analysis was performed on the data collected, to identify possible interrelations among the three factors examined. Results: For managers and subordinates, results showed that a substantial proportion of their communication satisfaction was explained by their levels of interpersonal trust. Differences in the communication satisfaction and software trust, between military and civil employees were also observed. The results of civil employees exhibit higher mean scores than that of military for all three factors. Overall, communication satisfaction was found to have a stronger association with interpersonal than with software trust.

"Work, Gender, and Sexual Harassment on the Frontlines of Commercial Travel: A Cross-Sectional Study of Flight Crew Well-Being","2020","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2020.1796488","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089538180&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2020.1796488&partnerID=40&md5=c10d0f0031a00b5916d99b0f6d06048d","Background: The scale and scope of experience of sexual harassment at work among male and female flight attendants was examined. Flight attendants are a predominantly female workforce with an occupational heritage of female and male sexualized stereotypes. Method: Data represented perception and prevalence of sexual harassment related to hostile work environment among 8,700 North American (U.S. and Canada) and 1,887 United Kingdom (UK) flight attendants in the Flight Attendant Health Study. Results: Sexual harassment, mostly from passengers, pilots, and coworkers, was reported by 26% of North American flight attendants and 11% of UK flight attendants. Yet, 61% of UK flight attendants experienced unwanted sexual behaviors, pointing to possible underreporting of the sexual harassment problem. Sexually offensive behaviors received variable labeling as sexual harassment depending on gender of the victim and perpetrator profile. Conclusion: Sexual harassment is a potentially underreported workplace problem for flight attendants with underreporting resulting from gender-specific differences in individual perceptions. Understanding these differences is vital to addressing sexual harassment and the concomitant health risks. Traditional client and customer attitudes might lead to rose-colored victims’ judgment, especially in the case of customer service jobs involving emotional labor. Our results provide new information to guide future research regarding well-being of this understudied group of service employees. © 2020 The Author(s).

"The Effectiveness of a Mnemonic-Type Startle and Surprise Management Procedure for Pilots","2020","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2020.1763798","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086935091&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2020.1763798&partnerID=40&md5=d58915af835fbdf758f7b76051b10443","Background: Mnemonic-type startle and surprise procedures were previously proposed to help pilots cope with startle and surprise in-flight, but effects on performance after procedure execution have not yet been investigated. Objective: Thus, we tested the effectiveness a new mnemonic-type procedure in a moving-base simulator with a non-linear model of a small twin-propeller aircraft flown single-pilot. Method: An experimental group of twelve line pilots was trained to use a four-item procedure: 1. Calm down: take a deep breath, sit up straight and relax shoulders and hands. 2. Observe: call out the basic flight parameters. 3. Outline: formulate a hypothesis about the problem. 4. Lead: formulate and execute a plan of action. A control group of twelve line pilots received a control training. Next, all pilots performed four scenarios with startling and surprising events. Data were obtained on pilot performance, stress, procedure application and evaluation. Results: Application of the procedure in the test scenarios was high (90.0% full, 100.0% partly), and pilots evaluated the procedure positively (median: 4 on a 1–5 point scale). There was significantly superior decision-making in the experimental group, but immediate responses were significantly less optimal. Pilots sometimes applied the procedure at inappropriate moments. Conclusion: The results of the tested mnemonic-type procedure were promising. The procedure may benefit, however, from modifications to reduce complexity and to stimulate application at the appropriate moment. © 2020 The Author(s).

Background: One of the major topics of behavioral economics is the issue of decision-making under uncertainty, and prospect theory is the most prominent theory in the field. This theory claims that individuals’ perceptions of losses are more severe than their perceptions of gains, and thus, the utility–value function is not symmetrical. Method: Two studies (N = 39 and N = 49) were performed in which business aviation safety professionals were asked to assess several risk expressions. In each study, subjects were divided into two groups. One group assessed unframed risk events, while the other assessed positively framed ones. Average probability values of each group were compared to each other, in order to understand whether framing caused a shift in risk assessment. Results: Positively framing the risk expressions caused risk assessors to focus on threats instead of existing measures and to show “risk aversion” for two out of five risks–notably, the two related to human factors. Conclusion: These results show that prospect theory predictions regarding decision-making under uncertainty may not be limited to financial decisions and can be extended to safety risk assessment. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Adversity in the workplace causes occupational stress, influencing resiliency, and reducing job performance and wellness. This can lead to burnout and attrition. Female pilots in male-dominated work environments experience adversity, resulting in occupational stress. Resilience may be a mitigating factor for coping with occupational stress. Women in male-dominated professions remain the extreme minority. Further, a severe pilot shortage magnifies the need to recruit and retain pilots from underrepresented groups. Method: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to validate the use of the CD-RISC for measuring resilience in female pilots. Inter- and intra-group resilience score comparisons of the 1,302 female pilots were analyzed. Results: An abridged version of the CD-RISC was found applicable to measuring resilience in female pilots. Age and work experience of the female pilots imply that they may influence higher resilience. A significantly lower resilience score was found in the sample in comparison to a national sample average resilience score. Conclusion: Female pilots’ resilience is likely influenced by workplace adversity, which may lead to increased occupation stress, greater attrition, and fewer pilot entrants. Interventions aimed at increasing the resiliency of female pilots are critical to solving the pilot shortage. The findings provide insight into the recruitment, retention, and development of women in male-dominated occupations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Although life preservers are required on an airplane in some overwater operations by the regulations of many countries, some airlines and many passengers have ignored life preservers. Method: Different requirements for life preservers are presented and compared. Then the progress on life preservers is analyzed. Based on these analyses, two problems of existing life preservers are summarized, and corresponding challenges are also proposed. Results: The difficulty of donning life preservers has been repeatedly proved through some major attempts to solve the problem. Furthermore, existing life preservers may make the passengers at risk of flight over cold water due to lack of thermal protection.

Results showed that performance in the nonexecutive task degraded after approximately 7 hr. Fatigue ratings showed a matching trend to the performance in this task. Performance in tasks taxing executive functions did not decline. We interpreted that fatigue can be overridden by increased attentional effort for executive tasks but not for non-executive components of cognition.

Background: Air medical professionals face unique challenges above and beyond the difficulty of working in a hospital setting or prehospital ground medicine. Providers frequently work multiple 24-hour shifts, resulting in circadian rhythm disturbance and cumulative sleep loss. The plane environment and the effects of flight are also contributory to fatigue; however, air medics must engage in emergent, time-sensitive, life-saving procedures despite these challenging circumstances. Although the aeromedical industry has rapidly expanded in the past several decades, the field of flight medicine lacks validated tools to evaluate fatigue levels, and many companies rely on flight providers’ recognition of fatigue to prevent work-related mistakes. Method: To establish construct validity, scores on the FRA were compared to scores on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), an objective measure of fatigue. Results: The results indicate that a total of five questions on the FRA was significantly and strongly correlated with mean reaction time on the PVT (r =.60, p =.001). Perceived fitness for duty was poorly correlated with fatigue levels as measured by the FRA (r <.01) suggesting medics may have difficulty recognizing when they are fatigued and fit for duty. Conclusion: The air medical industry is rapidly expanding, and valid and reliable measures are indicated to assess fatigue levels among providers. Initial findings suggest the FRA is an efficient tool to objectively measure the fatigue levels of air medics through a self-report measure. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: This study follows an earlier study where 59 official safety reports of unsafe missed approach procedure (MAP) events were analyzed. Method: The current study utilized these reports to explore the relations between the aircrew’s specific flight experience (SFE) on the aircraft’s type rating that was involved in the incident and the aircrews’ performance during MAP safety incident. Results: There were significantly more incidents involving CAPs with intermediate level of SFE than incidents involving CAPs with high or low SFE. Furthermore, the interrelation between the SFEs of the CAP and the FO of the same aircrew showed that the number of incidents involving FOs with low SFE was significantly higher than that involving FOs with higher SFE. Furthermore, there were significantly more MAP events when the FO took the role of pilot monitoring compared to pilot flying. Discussion: It is suggested that CAPs with an intermediate SFE might feel that they have sufficient skills to operate the airplane, but in fact, they are not yet skilled enough.

Background: Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Black Hole Illusion (BHI), with differing predictions. The Constant Visual Angle hypothesis predicts that short runways should cause greater BHI. Meanwhile, several other hypotheses predict that longer runways should cause more severe BHI. In addition, there is debate whether lack of ground cues promotes BHI via autokinesis or by biasing pilots’ perception of the runway. Method: Nineteen qualified pilots flew 27 simulated nighttime approaches in a fixed-base flight simulator. Participants flew under different combinations of runway length, starting distance from the runway, and starting altitude. We analyzed glideslope error, defined as a weighted sum of the error above or below a prescribed 3° glideslope, as well as RMSE around the approach path. Results: We found that pilots tended to demonstrate worse BHI effects during approaches to longer runways and when starting at low altitudes compared to high altitudes. Daylight and nighttime flights showed a similar variance around the glideslope. Conclusion: The constant visual angle hypothesis is not supported by our findings. We observed consistent glideslopes across starting locations and similar variance during day/night conditions, leading us to favor biased perception of the runway over autokinetic effects to explain the influence of contextual features on BHI. ©, The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Navy, Department of Defense, nor the U.S. Government.

Background: Pilot selection is relevant in assessing pilots’ susceptibility to SD. However, SD-related accidents indicate that it may not be fully effective. Method: A set of 12 flight sequences (six containing an SD conflict, three with vestibular and three with visual illusions) was flown by military pilots (N = 20; age: M = 31.6; SD = 8.22) and non-pilots (N = 20; age: M = 30.95; SD = 7.72) in a flight simulator specially designed for SD research and training. The number and mean magnitude of control reversal errors (CREs) were calculated along with the effects of SD conflict on flight performance. Results: With two exceptions, in all SD-conflict flights, the mean number of CREs increased. For mean magnitudes of CREs, the same effects were not observed. Pilots and non-pilots differed in disorientation conditions (M = 4.5 ± 1.95 vs M = 2.6 ± 2.41) only in one profile (shape constancy illusion). In the other two (false horizon and leans illusions), the applied SD cues significantly affected their flight performance. Conclusion: Although the effects of SD cues on flight performance were observed, the applied disorientation scenario would not be useful in the pilot selection procedure. To provide the criteria to select pilot candidates, other disorientation scenarios, or even a different flight simulator should be considered. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: SPO/RCO have been investigated with different methods from various disciplines and different organizations to make research progress. The results of federal agencies’, universities’, and EU-projects’ research activities have not been brought together for synthesis yet. Method: We systematically searched for SPO and RCO as independent and fixed search terms retrieving altogether 75 publications on the topic. Exclusion criteria were general and military aviation. Results: Establishing an appropriate function allocation to cope with high workload and off-nominal situations could be achieved by applying a variety of methods and the consideration of advanced automation systems. Their application is required to investigate pilot incapacitation and communication issues further. Data-link and certification issues were acknowledged in principle and have not been solved yet. Conclusion: In sum, experimental studies and modeling techniques of system ergonomics have addressed operational issues very well. Pilot health monitoring systems are less well elaborated than system protection. Future research needs to integrate different research findings and automation technologies. This is necessary to make RCO to a viable and attractive option for commercial development in aviation.

The observed pattern indicates that vibrotactile warning signals may offer a plausible mode for conveying information during increasing levels of primary task workload. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.","attention and vigilance; flight tasks; mental workload; resource allocation; warning signals",""

Background: BHI occurs when impoverished visual conditions at night cause pilots to fly too low on landing approaches. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain BHI, without clear consensus in the literature. Method: We conducted multiple experiments in which participants judged the intersection point of dotted lines on a computer screen. In Experiment 1, participants placed a horizon line where they believed two converging dotted line segments should intersect. In Experiments 2A and 2B, participants estimated the intersection point of single dotted line segments with a separate solid line. Results: Participants in Experiment 1 tended to place the intersection point of two converging lines too low on the computer screen. Participants in Experiments 2A and 2B tended to respond as if the stimulus lines were more horizontal than actually presented. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pilots misjudge the location of an implicit horizon based on the runway edge lines. In the context of a visual spatial strategy that assumes a stable horizon, such a misperception may cause pilots to adopt a low flight path. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: The barrage of data in the GCS visual interface has the potential to isolate the operator from detecting system hazards that threatens the ability of the operator to operate the UAS effectively. Method: The pitch of the UAS’s engine revolutions per minute was mapped to a sonification, and excessive attitude upset of the UAS was mapped to a tactification in order to present a continuous awareness of the system’s health without being invasive and obtrusive. Participants with and without flying experience were required to monitor system health, while carrying out a secondary task. Results: Regardless of flying experience, sonification enhanced hazard detection compared to a visual-only GCS interface, but tactification did not aid performance. Conclusion: While multimodal displays have been studied in remotely piloted vehicles, this is the initial effort to demonstrate that sonification can influence perceived urgency leading to greater warning compliance. Further research is warranted to develop guidelines to ensure that non-visual signals can convey different levels of urgency for a continuous awareness of a system’s health, and thereby permit the operator to establish the appropriate level of priority to address the alarmed condition. © 2019, © 2019 Crown Copyright.","",""

Background: Data-linked mosaic NEXRAD images can be more than 14 min delayed by the time they reach the cockpit for use by pilots. The NTSB issued a safety alert to warn that the NEXRAD “age indicator” can be misleading. Unfortunately, research has indicated that pilots may not be fully aware of the delay and that it can adversely affect their decision-making and performance. Method: The three types of timestamps were “direct age”, “clock”, and “UTC” with three levels of time delay (short, medium, and long). Twenty-one participants read and compared two radar images, via timestamps, to determine the length of delay and which one was more recent. Results: The results indicated that the type of timestamp and the length of time delay significantly affected participants’ response time and accuracy. “UTC” timestamp with a long-time delay was associated with the longest response time and low accuracy. The “direct age” timestamp led to the highest accuracy and shortest response time for all manipulated levels of time delay. Conclusion: Although “UTC” format is commonly used in many weather products, we found the “direct age” format to be the superior method to support perceptions of time delay. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The risk approach of the ICAO Safety Management System is completely based on the “risk” concept only and it recommends a risk assessment method not considering that some events can be described as uncertainty rather than risk because of insufficient data. Uncertainty conditions are complex and not-calculable events so the risk evaluation process may be error-prone due to the subjectivity of experts. This paper suggests using “tallying checklists” which are based on unit weight additive linear model, for making the probability and severity value assignments more consistent. Moreover, two checklists were created for a business jet operator and the twenty recent risk assessments of the operator were re-evaluated by using these checklists. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Current ULR scheduling for cabin crew is predominantly based on flight crew data. However, cabin crew workload is very different in nature to that of flight crew. Method: Fifty-five cabin crew wore an actigraph and completed a sleep/duty diary to monitor sleep during a ULR trip. At TOD, crewmembers completed a 5-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), rated their sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and fatigue (Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check), and after landing their workload (NASA Task Load Index). Results: When workload was perceived as higher, crewmembers felt more sleepy and fatigued and had more PVT lapses at TOD. The effect of workload on sleepiness was larger (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.27) than the duration of wakefulness (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.14), but the effect of workload on fatigue (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.17) was smaller than the duration of wakefulness (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.24). Lapses were not associated with sleep history, whereas workload had a small effect (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.14). Conclusion: Workload as a fatigue factor for cabin crew warrants ongoing monitoring. This can be achieved by including a workload question in fatigue reports as an essential component in Fatigue Risk Management Systems. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Conducted in a South African aviation context, this study explored the phenomenon of peer support and its role and contribution as an effective response to addressing the emotional well-being of pilots. A qualitative phenomenological research design was followed using Rubin and Rubin?s in-depth, semi-structured interview technique to understand lived experiences of peer support. Nine interviews were held, six with airline pilots - a combination of peers and flight operations managers - and three with mental health professionals (MHPs). Braun and Clarke?s thematic analysis (TA) method elicited themes in relation to peer support and the mental health and well-being of pilots. Four themes emerged relating to (a) the conceptualization of peer support, the role of the peer, and the principles on which the process is founded; (b) pilots? experience of their workplace as emotionally ""unsafe"" and deficient in acknowledging the nature of different emotional stressors; (c) the well-being of pilots and medical certification of fitness for duty; and (d) the multidimensional contribution of peer support and factors critical to integrating successful and sustainable peer support. This study underscores the importance of developing a more integrated definition of safety in aviation that incorporates supporting the mental health and well-being of pilots.

Background: AGCAS has been deployed to prevent loss of F-16 fighters from ground collision using a high-level automation design capable of altering the aircraft’s flight control system independent of pilot action. Understanding pilots’ acceptance behavior with respect to the system could allow future stakeholders to make reasonable inferences about some factors that are important to achieving positive pilot acceptance of highly automated aircraft systems. Method: Using data from a survey of active-duty U.S. Air Force F-16 operational fighter pilots (N = 142), an AGCAS-specific TAM was analyzed using the structural equation modeling method.

Background: English language proficiency requirements, standardized phraseology, and readbacks are some of the proactive measures which the aviation industry employs to ensure effective communication. However, despite these efforts, errors in communication still occur, and anecdotal evidence suggests that factors such as language background and phase of flight increase the likelihood of communication errors. Method: Eighteen hours of air-ground communications at Kingsford Smith International Airport, Sydney, Australia, were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that accented pilots committed more communication errors than native English sounding pilots and more specifically that these errors were mistakes rather than omissions, and involved words rather than numbers. Communication performance was similar in the approach and departure phases of flight regardless of language background. Conclusion: These results provide detailed information about the type of communication errors which occur in commercial aviation, their prevalence and the context in which they occur, which helps guide where resources should be directed to further improve safety. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Teleoperation is a key operation during spaceflight. Comprehensive scientific evaluation techniques for teleoperation performance are important for astronaut selection and training. Method: Four categories of indices, i.e., completion performance, safety performance, subjective cognitive performance and physiological parameters, were adopted in this model. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to compute the weight coefficients of the indices to construct the linear performance model. Sixty-four male subjects were recruited to complete three teleoperation tasks, including point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance, in simulated environments. Their performance was rated by the researchers after the tasks. Results: The safety performance index had the highest weight coefficient (0.5274) of the first level indices, and the weight coefficient of the collisions index (0.8227) was the highest of the second level indices for safety performance. The linear performance model was constructed to calculate comprehensive performance values. Conclusion: Safety considerations are the most important factors for astronauts to consider in teleoperation. The collision of the robotic arm is the most vital safety index.

Background: Three possible alternatives for CDO at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) in Taiwan are presented: (a) open path-radar vectoring-based CDO, (b) open path-time control-based CDO, and (c) open path procedure permitting CDO to downwind. Method: One hundred and twenty surveys were distributed and 61 pilots and 49 controllers responded. Eight pilots and 25 controllers had experience implementing CDOs. Results: All respondents ranked altitude control as the most important design factor. Pilots with CDO experience preferred to reduce the frequency of communication in the procedure, whereas experienced controllers expected to know the approach path as early as possible. Conclusion: Altitude control is the highest priority design factor for improving the current CDO procedure at TPE. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""
"How Do General Aviation Pilots Choose Their Route When Flying in Complex Airspace?","2019","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2019.1596744","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064714723&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2019.1596744&partnerID=40&md5=7392459aaa18008033b4cf047e53cd51","Objective: This study is an analysis of the planning of general aviation (GA) pilots and its impact on airspace infringements. Background: Past studies identified the contribution of inadequate flight planning to airspace infringements in Europe, but without any discussion relating to the processes involved and their shortcomings. This article, therefore, examines the flight route decision making of GA pilots. Method: Twenty-seven recreational GA pilots who flew an airplane, glider, or ultralight aircraft were interviewed using semistructured interviews in Finland, Norway, and the United Kingdom. These nations experienced a relatively high number of reported airspace infringements. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The results showed that GA pilots planned a route near controlled or restricted airspace especially in areas with small uncontrolled airspace. This decision was typical for GA pilots who were based in the capitals of the European nations. The selected flight path and altitude were influenced by factors related to the pilot (e.g., risk management) and the airspace design (e.g., low lower boundary of controlled airspace). Pilots who were aware of the risk of straying into airspace while flying such a route considered mitigation measures, such as cross-checking the aircraft’s position frequently. Conclusion: Such findings can address airspace infringements by encouraging pilots to take mitigation actions while flying such a route, including flying at a greater distance from the airspace. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

CDOs reduce fuel consumption and noise emissions. Therefore, they are supported by airports as well as airlines. However, their use often depends on pilots asking for CDOs and controllers giving approval and directions. An adapted NASA Total Load Index (TLX) was used to measure the workload perception of ATCOs and pilots when applying CDOs at selected European airports. The main finding is that ATCOs' workload increased when giving both closed- and open-path CDOs, which may have a negative impact on their willingness to apply CDOs. The main problem reported by pilots was insufficient distance-to-go information provided by ATCOs. The workload change is important when considering the use of CDOs. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.","ATCO workload; closed- and open-path approach; continuous descent operations (CDOs); NASA TLX; pilot workload",""

Background: Early-career civil aviation pilots have been shown to form more accurate cognitive maps of a novel virtual environment than nonpilots. We sought to extend this finding to determine whether cognitive map accuracy was also associated with pilot flight experience. Method: Pilots completed small-scale spatial ability tasks, including assessments of perspective taking and spatial working memory, and then traveled along 4 routes in a virtual environment. Subsequently, they completed 2 tests that assessed their memory for the layout of landmarks in the virtual environment.

Background: Pilots are regulated to refrain from duty when their mental or physical state could endanger safety. Still, the human factor is the greatest contributor to aviation accidents, and mishaps are attributed to human unfitness (physical or mental state of the operator), suggesting that pilots might engage in presenteeism. Presenteeism and its consequences have been studied across several occupational groups, but until now pilots have been neglected. Method: Data were collected using an online self-report questionnaire (N = 1,133) consisting of items investigating presenteeism, mental health, and self-reported error rates. Results: Results demonstrated that 63% of the pilots exhibited acts of inappropriate presenteeism in the past year. Inappropriate presentee pilots and pilots with poor recovery in terms of feelings of rest, physical and mental tiredness, and work-related worry, were also more likely to report committing 5 or more errors when on flight duty in the past 12 months. This relationship was not mediated by mental health, as shown in previous research.

However, very few studies have directly addressed their roles in training success. Method: Two hundred participants completed the computerized WM and VPT tasks individually at the beginning of flight training. Those who succeeded in the primary phase entered the advanced phase. Logistic regressions were done to determine the associations between WM and VPT and success or failure of training.

Background: Psychophysiological measures such as eye tracking in pilots are useful for detecting fatigue or high-workload conditions, for investigating motion sickness and hypoxia, or for assessing display improvements and expertise. Method: We review the uses of eye tracking on pilots and include eye-tracking studies published in aviation journals, with both a historical and contemporary view. We include 79 papers and assign the results to the following three categories: Human performance, aircraft design, health and physiological factors affecting performance. We then summarize the different uses of eye tracking in each category and highlight metrics which turned out to be useful in each area. Our review is complementary to that of Ziv  (2016). Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose useful application areas for the measurement of eye tracking. Eye tracking has the potential to be effective in terms of preventing errors or injuries by detecting, for example, fatigue or performance decrements. Applied in an appropriate manner in simulated or real flight it can help to ensure optimal functioning of man–machine systems.

Background: Preflight safety briefings are required prior to every commercial flight. To meet this requirement, airlines often use prerecorded briefings, in the form of audio or video, which can sometimes be supplemented with a live demonstration. Method: One hundred and sixty-two participants were randomly divided into 5 groups—control (no briefing), audio only, audio plus live demonstration, video only, and video plus live demonstration—and exposed to a prerecorded safety briefing. Recall performance in terms of key safety messages was analyzed postbriefing, as well as changes in mood from pre- to postbriefing.

Of interest was whether the effects found in earlier studies, favoring the moving-aircraft format, could be replicated with most recent technology including extended horizon displays, which depict the artificial horizon extended over the whole screen with overlaying speed and altitude scales (e.g., B787). Background: Although the moving-horizon format represents the standard approach in Western aviation, human factors research from the 1950s to the 1970s with round electromechanical instruments favored the moving-aircraft format with respect to better support of flight-path tracking and unusual attitude recoveries. However, recent studies using laboratory displays more similar to modern primary flight displays provided inconsistent results. This led to the assumption that the display’s design is a moderating factor of those effects. Method: Thirty-two novices and 13 pilots flew several tracking and recovery tasks in a PC-based simulator equipped with moving-horizon and moving-aircraft formats in classic and extended horizon design. Results: The data show that the previous effects favoring a moving-aircraft format of displaying bank information can be replicated with current primary flight display designs. However, the extended horizon design seems to reduce this effect, at least for pilots. Conclusion: The results suggest reconsidering the format of the attitude indicator at least for new applications, such as control of remotely piloted aircraft. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Spatial disorientation (SD), the inability to correctly determine the position and orientation of the aircraft in relation to the ground, poses a serious threat in aviation and can impair the cognitive performance of pilots while flying. More evidence is needed on the effects of visual and vestibular SD on cognition in flight simulators. Method: Pilots performed an auditory selective attention (duration discrimination) task (Experiment 1, N = 16) or an auditory working memory (N-back) task (Experiment 2, N = 16) while completing 6 different flight profiles in the disorientation and control conditions in the GYRO-IPT flight simulator. The flight scenarios included 3 visual illusions (false horizon, shape constancy, size constancy) and 3 vestibular illusions (somatogyral illusion, Coriolis effect, the leans). Results: In both experiments the cognitive performance (task accuracy) decreased for flight profiles with the leans illusion. Also, the flight performance (measured as the number of control reversal errors) was worse for the false horizon illusion and for the somatogyral illusion in both experiments. Conclusion: The results suggest that SD, particularly the vestibular illusion of the leans, can impair selective attention and working memory processes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Although the number of accidents in GA flight continues to decrease over time, one troubling situation is when pilots encounter hazardous weather. Although research has approached this topic from a variety of perspectives, prior research has not offered a detailed inspection of GA pilots’ knowledge about weather concepts and phenomena, weather products, and the implications of weather concepts and products to flight—knowledge that is fundamental for pilots to develop higher order cognitive skills in aviation weather. A valid and reliable assessment tool to measure pilots’ knowledge of weather is not available.

Background: A significant number of fatal general aviation (GA) accidents are attributable to pilots flying into instrument meteorological conditions without the necessary certification for safe operation. Even when takeoff conditions are clear, they can degrade in flight. Pilots might consult in-flight  weather technologies to inform flight-plan-related decisions. Method: GA pilots flew 2 scenarios in FTDs while receiving weather notifications (referred to here as alerts) via complex graphical or smart-watch-based visual displays and under different vibrotactile cuing conditions. In-flight testing examined if vibrotactile cuing effects found in simulation were present in real flight. Results: Results suggest the quality and timeliness of weather-related flight decisions and flight-related SA are better supported when displays use vibrotactile cues and embed alert text within maps rather than present it separately on a smart watch. In-flight data confirmed that pilots can reliably perceive vibrotactile cues in real aircraft. Conclusion: Vibrotactile cues improve the reception of notifications and can reduce cognitive demands while flying. Visual weather information should be displayed on larger screens that are positioned to reduce pilots’ postural reorientation. These findings can inform the design of weather technologies for supporting pilot in-flight decision making. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

"Barriers and Facilitators to Voluntary Reporting and Their Impact on Safety Culture","2017","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","10.1080/24721840.2018.1442221","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062007093&doi=10.1080%2F24721840.2018.1442221&partnerID=40&md5=41a631fc448a8cf7f92ad29e25f9958c","Objective: Determine barriers and facilitators to effective voluntary reporting system (VRS) operation. Background: As human error accounts for a larger portion of accidents and incidents in high-risk industries, federal agencies that define regulations and guidelines promote various safety management techniques, including more robust safety data collection. VRSs aim to identify and address “near misses” (errors identified before resulting in negative outcomes) through employee disclosure of committed errors and violations. Despite their value, VRSs are underutilized. Method: A literature review was conducted to understand successful safety management practices and challenges, and define reporting requirements for accidents, incidents, and near misses (which rely on voluntary disclosure). Variations in the policies, processes, and utility of several VRSs were explored, and common themes were identified. Interviews were then conducted with VRS developers, users, and managers to further explore these themes. Results: The literature review narrowed the focus to confidential, nonpunitive VRSs for process and product safety concerns, such as the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). Common themes exposed 8 categories of barriers and facilitators to effective VRS operation, participation, and use of report data. The literature review verified and elaborated on these barriers, and offered solutions (facilitators) based on personal observations and experiences. Conclusion: Consistent themes associated with effective and ineffective VRS operation can be used to improve VRS participation and the effectiveness of error prediction and prevention capabilities. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Whereas verbal and math tests are commonly used in academic and pre-employment selection, spatial ability and perceptual speed testing are less common. Spatial ability and perceptual speed tests have been a mainstay in U.S. Air Force aviation training selection batteries for decades, as part of the process for selecting aviation training candidates. Method and Results: Factor analysis (Study 1) of spatial, perceptual speed, and academic aptitude tests shows a 2-factor solution. Meta-analysis results (Study 2) of the predictive validity of spatial and perceptual speed tests relative to verbal, math, and technical knowledge tests show spatial ability, aviation knowledge, and perceptual speed tests are better significant predictors of aviator flying performance, whereas academic aptitude best predicts classroom performance. Incremental validity analyses (Study 3) of spatial and perceptual speed above academic and technical knowledge for academic and pilot trainee flying performance were performed. Although spatial ability lacks incremental validity over academic and technical aptitude, perceptual speed has incremental validity above academic and technical aptitude for predicting pilot trainee flying performance. Conclusion: Perceptual speed, an aspect of spatial ability, can provide incremental predictive validity beyond academic and technical knowledge measures alone for applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields like military aviation. ©, This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.","",""

Background: Prior research identified the costs of such 3D perspective hazard displays, presented from an exocentric perspective, because of their ambiguity in presenting spatial relations in an unstructured 3D space. Research also supported the advantage of display overlay, particularly when both databases (traffic and weather) need to be integrated to make hazard avoidance judgments. The two variables had not been examined in conjunction. Method: Seventeen certified flight instructors flew a series of hazard avoidance maneuvers in a part-task simulator, with four displays, created by the combination of 3D versus 2-dimensional (2D) perspective and separate versus overlay hazard formats. Positioning of traffic and weather that would make it necessary to avoid hazards was designed to allow the study of both the strengths of overlay and weaknesses of 3D integration. Results: The data clearly indicated that hazard avoidance was worse with the 3D perspective display, for both traffic and weather hazards, and pointed to ambiguity as the cause. Display overlay was better than separation, but only when the task required consulting both databases. Conclusion: 3D perspective displays are not advised for hazard presentation on the flight deck. Overlays can be helpful, as long as clutter issues are addressed. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The rhetoric of this article revolves around passenger perceptions and their willingness to fly on board such aircraft. Background: Although studies have been conducted to gauge similar consumer perceptions, this study compared 3 different 2-pilot configurations based on pilot gender to that of the autonomous or automated cockpit. These configurations included 2 male pilots, 1 male and 1 female pilot, and 2 female pilots. Method: 433 participants from India and the United States were recruited using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and responded to questions designed to measure consumer perceptions on the topic at hand. The study used Rice, Mehta, et al.’s (2015) willingness-to-fly scale to collect the data. Results: The results suggested that all participants were more willing to fly on board all 3 types of 2-pilot configurations as opposed to the autonomous cockpit. However, Indian male participants showed a decrease in willingness to fly on board the 2-female-pilot configurations as opposed to the other 2-human-pilot configurations. Additionally, U.S. participants were much less willing to fly on board the autonomous configuration as compared to their Indian counterparts. Conclusion: The findings suggest that all participants were least willing to fly on aircraft flown completely by an autopilot.

Background: New flight-safety regulations for commercial aviation recommend the introduction of surprise and startle in upset prevention and recovery training. This calls for more evidence on the effects of surprise on pilot performance, as well as methods to effectively induce surprise in training simulators. Method: The study took place in a motion-base simulator with a poststall aerodynamic model. Using a within-subjects design, the recovery performance of 20 pilots was tested in 2 conditions: 1 anticipated condition, and 1 surprise condition. In addition to flight parameters, subjective and physiological data relating to surprise and startle were measured. Results: Pilots had significantly more difficulties with adhering to the recovery procedure in the surprise condition compared to the anticipation condition. The subjective and physiological measures confirmed that the manipulation mainly increased surprise, and to a lesser extent also startle. Conclusion: The results suggest that pilots have more difficulty in managing an upset situation (i.e., an aerodynamic stall) when this situation is presented unexpectedly, underlining that upset prevention and recovery training should include elements of surprise. ©, © The Authors.

Background: Data overload, especially in the visual channel, and associated breakdowns in monitoring represent a major challenge in aviation. These problems are expected to worsen with NextGen, which will require pilots to manage increased amounts of data and adopt new responsibilities. The introduction of multimodal interfaces (interfaces that distribute information across multiple sensory channels) has been proposed as a means to offload the overburdened visual channel and thus address data overload. Method: Experienced commercial airline pilots completed 2 scenarios using a medium-fidelity flight simulator. For each scenario, NextGen tasks and events were presented either using technology that is currently available (visual and auditory displays) or technology proposed as part of NextGen design concepts (i.e., tactile and redundant displays). Performance was measured based on response time and accuracy. Results: Faster responses were observed for redundant displays, compared to either vision or audition alone. No significant benefit of redundancy was found for accuracy and workload did not mediate redundancy effects. For traffic events, there were faster response times with tactile displays, but higher response accuracy with auditory displays. Conclusion: The findings from this research add to the knowledge base in multimodal information processing and can inform the design of displays for NextGen operations. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Accident and incident analyses have revealed that go-around procedures are often imperfectly performed because of their complexity, their high time stress, and their rarity of occurrence that avails little time for practice. We wished to examine this experimentally and establish the frequency and nature of errors in both flight-performance and visual scanning. Method: We collected flight-performance (e.g., errors in procedures, excessive flight deviations) and eye-tracking data of 12 flight crews who performed final approach and go-around flight phases in realistic full-flight transport-category simulators. Results: The pilot performance results showed that two thirds of the crews committed errors including critical trajectory deviations during go-arounds, a precursor of accidents. Eye-tracking analyses revealed that the cross-checking process was not always efficient in detecting flight-path deviations when they occurred. Ocular data also highlighted different visual strategies between the 2 crew members during the 2 flight phases. Conclusion: This study reveals that the go-around is a challenging maneuver. It demonstrates the advantages of eye tracking and suggests that it is a valuable tool for the explicit training of attention allocation during go-arounds to enhance flight safety. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Performance in the cockpit depends strongly on contextual aspects such as specific tasks (e.g., precision or non-precision approach), crew composition (e.g., level of experience), operational environment (weather conditions, airport layout, etc.), interaction with other groups such as air traffic control, and dynamic factors such as potential technical failures. The significance of contextual factors for performance makes adaptation to the specific operational demands a key factor for performance. Research on cockpit crews confirms that adaptation to contextual factors is significant for performance: Crew Resource Management (CRM performance) of cockpit crews varies across different scenarios, indicating low trans-situational consistency (Haeusler, Klampfer, Amacher and Naef, 2004; Brannick, Prince, Prince and Salas, 1995).

In what way can a flight crew mediate problems? How are we to understand reported errors? Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety presents recent findings in aviation psychology, bringing fresh insights to such questions. Aviation psychologists study personnel selection and training; they evaluate the management of flight operations, and ultimately they analyse the things that went wrong. The strong interrelation between these components allows us to talk about a chain of safety. This volume appraises this chain of safety by considering the mechanisms that determine its effectiveness - input mechanisms, coping mechanisms and control mechanisms. Each contribution discusses a component of the chain while the book as a whole emphasizes and illustrates that understanding the connections between these parts is essential for the future. By addressing these issues the book leads to further considerations such as how mistakes are linked to training and how coping mechanisms should help us to understand errors and accidents. Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety will appeal to aviation professionals (human factors experts, safety managers, pilots, ATCOs, air navigation service providers, etc.) and academics, researchers, graduates and postgraduates in human factors and psychology. Although primarily written for the aviation industry, this book will also be of interest to other high-risk dynamic activities that face similar challenges: the need to present effective and safe outcomes to the public in general and the stakeholders in particular. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C.

A timely but complex set of commands must be communicated for a safe flight operation, particularly in congested airspace. For example, in 1991 a tower controller instructed an aircraft to hold on Runway 24, intending to clear it for take-off as soon as other traffic had passed. The controller was pre-occupied with making radio transmissions and monitoring other aircraft that caused the take-off clearance to be forgotten. Instead, another plane was ordered to land on Runway 24, which resulted in a catastrophic accident (Aviation Safety Network, 1991). This human error can, at least partially, be attributed to a memory failure exacerbated by multiple tasks that needed to be performed by the responsible controller. The specific kind of memory that was deficient in this case is called prospective memory. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C. D’Oliveira 2012.","",""

Pilots may be forced to control the aircraft manually during abnormal situations, such as when recovering from unusual attitudes outside the automations limits of authority or during automation failures. Alternatively, during normal operations pilots may choose to adopt manual control where reconfiguring the automation may not be the most efficient option, for instance when performing a “sidestep” (US) manoeuvre to accommodate a late change in the assigned arrival runway. However, during the vast majority of airline operations the requirement for manual flight is limited.

In contrast with simulator training, learning processes in OJT are difficult to assess, because the learning tasks cannot be planned in advance due to the ongoing air traffic. The assessment system in OJT was designed in such a way that the trainees’ progression can nonetheless be monitored. The reliability and validity of CBAS have been evaluated in previous research (Oprins, Burggraaff, and Van Weerdenburg, 2006, 2008; Oprins, 2008). Here we present an evaluation with regard to the analysis of learning curves derived from assessment results. An adequate assessment of learning processes showing differences in individual learning patterns (e.g., slow starters, learning plateaus) and in performance (strengths and weaknesses) is of crucial importance as a basis for feedback on the learning process and for passfail decisions. CBAS compares the trainees’ actual performance to the required performance at successive moments of time. Under the assumption that performance is a reflection of the learning process (Oprins, 2008), it extracts learning curves from a sequence of performance measures over time. If trainees are learning, then their performance will increase (Oprins, 2008). © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C. D’Oliveira 2012.","",""

The First World War was the background for the development of personnel selection methods that countered pilot attrition rates in the early years of military aviation. Selection methods that were originally developed for aviation have since been widely adopted by other domains. After the Second World War, a new line of research emerged that was concerned with safety, in particular the role of the pilot in the safe operation of an aircraft. Accident statistics, safety management, human/machine interaction and human error are just a few topics that were advanced as a consequence. Again, the results of these efforts were influential elsewhere and aviation remained a leading industry where ideas on safety have been expanded and investigated. In the 1990s, a third line of research within aviation psychology that studies the interaction of people within a team became known as “crew resource management”. Focus on human interaction, as related to performance, also received major attention in the aviation industry. Despite their successive origins, all three themes have continued to develop within aviation psychology and have not lost their attraction for future research. Selection methods are continuously studied, particularly in the area of air traffic control. Theories on safety are still evolving and many aspects of aviation safety are in continuous need of attention. In addition, research on crew resource management is still gaining momentum. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C. D’Oliveira 2012.","",""

Without a proper way to anticipate the upcoming environment and events, many of our motor activities would be too slow and our actions would easily fall behind the stream of events. Even simple organisms like flies have to account for dynamics when flying - and their eye movements do. The principle of reafference has been developed by the Nobel-prize winners von Holst and Mittelstaedt (1950) to account for this fact and the fact that it is necessary to have a process that allows us to decide that a movement has been successful in a dynamic environment. Hoffmann’s model of Anticipatory Behaviour Control is an action theoretic conception that stresses the role of cognitive “top-down processes”. Cognitive “top-down processes” have been a matter of debate in scientific psychology with a long tradition. Since the time of William James and his ideomotor principle (1890-1981), action oriented concepts have been proposed in order to account for top-down processes of behavior. Important and more recent contributions to the role of anticipation in psychomotor behavior and perception stem from Neisser (1976), Prinz (1983) and Hommel, Musseler, Aschersleben, and Prinz (2001). Interestingly enough, these approaches have always been a kind of theoretical counterpart to the behavioristic S-R-Models or SORKC Models (Kanfer and Phillips, 1979). Anticipations are cognitive events that have not been observable directly with sufficient precision for a long period of research. Recent developments to combine behavioral neuroscience approaches, psychophysiological approaches, reconstruction techniques and behavioral observations in well defined paradigms make it possible to overcome the limitations of the old “introspective methodologies”. These were the basic methods of the early cognitive “research schools” like the “Würzburg School” (Külpe, 1922) who dealt with early developments of the relation between motivational and anticipatory components of behavioral organization (Ach, 1910). A more recent approach to integrate learning theory with anticipatory processes has been elaborated by Hoffmann (1993, 2003). His model explains why rewards work. By letting the individual expect the desired effect, rewards enhance the probability of a rewarded behavior in a given situation. Thus anticipations are not only functional in a dynamic environment by anticipation of future changes in the environment, anticipation might also be relevant with respect to its content. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C.

As Wreathall and Reason (1992) have so eloquently stated, the history of accidents is also the history of the human contribution to accidents. While human error is frequently seen as indicative of poor performance or aberrant behavior, this view is both counter-productive and typically untrue from the perspective of aviation safety. It is now well established that error is a natural part of human performance, and frequently unavoidable in day-to-day work activities.

"Investigating Non-Technical Skills in Scottish and English Aircraft Maintenance Teams Using a Mixed Methodology of Interviews and a Questionnaire","2016","International Journal of Aviation Psychology","10.1080/10508414.2017.1319734","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023779250&doi=10.1080%2F10508414.2017.1319734&partnerID=40&md5=09afd33121163c7cd519601475b72cc1","Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the non-technical skills used by aircraft maintenance crews. Background: Aircraft maintenance is a vital aspect of aviation, with failures in aircraft maintenance linked to one third of aircraft malfunctions. Research within other high-risk industries indicates the importance of non-technical skills in ensuring effective performance and reducing the risk of error. Method: A mixed-methods approach was used: Aircraft maintenance workers from 2 locations (Scotland and England, n = 24) were interviewed using the critical incident technique. A short survey was then distributed (n = 31) to further explore worker perceptions of non-technical skill usage across different organizational locations. Results: The interviews identified team-based non-technical skills as Situation awareness, decision making, leadership, teamwork and communication, and task management. Lone worker non-technical skills were identified as Situation awareness, decision making, and task management. The questionnaire study indicated that perception of task management was significantly more negative than for situation awareness, leadership, teamwork, and communication. Moreover, participants from Scottish units were significantly more positive about situation awareness and teamwork than their English counterparts. Conclusion: The results indicate that non-technical skills are an important aspect of aircraft maintenance workers’ work performance and safety, mirroring the findings reported within other high-risk industries. Variance across organizational units suggests future training programs must be tailored to fit each team. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Optimal gaze behavior can lead to improved flying performance under both normal and stressful conditions. Method: A computerized as well as a manual search of the literature was conducted. Articles were grouped according to prevalent themes, such as basic cockpit visual scanning, visual scanning in the automated cockpit, effects of new technology on visual scanning, nonnormal flight circumstances, differences between experts and novices, and mathematical models of visual scanning. A summary and key findings for each theme were reported. Results: The review revealed specific gaze behaviors that might be important when performing various flight tasks and when monitoring automated processes, and that can differentiate between expert and novice pilots. However, several concerns arose from the review. Among these concerns are the unexamined role of peripheral vision, the scarcity of studies on in-flight emergencies, and the lack of interventional studies. Conclusion: Specific gaze patterns appear to be related to improved flight performance. Future studies should address the methodological concerns mentioned to better clarify the relationship between gaze behavior and flying performance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Despite several decades of research, there is still debate regarding whether physical motion during flight simulation training improves later performance. Evidence suggests that presence of disturbance affects the utility of motion on transfer of training studies. Therefore, an important question is whether performance with disturbance motion (e.g., wind gusts) at test depends on whether participants practice with disturbance motion. Method: Naïve participants flew through a series of suspended rings in a motion-based simulator. Practice was with or without correlated (joystick control) and random motion (disturbance). The task was an analog of a flight task, modified to accommodate nonpilots. A quasi-transfer design included two practice blocks followed by two test blocks that incorporated both correlated and random motion. Results: No differences were detected in accuracy, but groups who practiced without disturbance made smaller joystick movements during both practice and test phases compared to those who practiced with disturbance. Conclusion: Practice without disturbance resulted in adoption of a different (possibly more efficient) joystick control strategy compared to practice with disturbance. The results suggest that during training, some control elements should be learned under relatively easy conditions, subsequently increasing in difficulty (e.g., add disturbance) at an optimal point in training. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Numerous studies suggest that estimating the closest point of approach (CPA) to heavy weather is difficult, and that current in-cockpit NEXRAD may be intrinsically inadequate for the task. Method: To investigate theoretically, we first examined the visual information present in looping NEXRAD. This predicted inherent task difficulty. Next, to investigate empirically, we developed a mathematical model of an “ideal storm,” generated a looping NEXRAD-type part-task simulation, and tested 21 general aviation (GA) pilots to measure effects of weather system depth (19 vs. 40 nm), and the opening and closing of gaps at various closure rates between cells (14, 7, 0, 7, 14 kt). Results: For the values tested, weather system depth had no significant effect on clearance from heavy weather (>40 dBZ reflectivity). However, weather movement greatly degraded safety. Moreover, it did not seem to matter if movement was as slow as 7 kt, nor whether gaps were opening or closing. Any weather movement made an already difficult task more so. Conclusion: Analysis suggests the necessity of adding future-predicted weather plus a range ring. Without these two key elements, judgment of CPA will clearly remain difficult. Training is also necessary to improve performance, but is unlikely to be sufficient. © , This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.","",""

Background: As flight simulation technology has become more advanced, and the associated costs have been reduced, there has been a corresponding increase in the use of flight simulation during ab initio phases of pilot training. Subsequently, important questions have arisen regarding the utility of simulation-based training to develop students’ rudimentary piloting skills. Method: The progression of 29 students completing a course consisting of 25% simulation is compared to a baseline sample of 62 students (sourced from historical data) completing the same course prior to the integration of additional simulation-based training. Results: The integration of simulation was found to have 2 primary impacts. Although a small decrease in aircraft training hours was evident, there was also a significant increase in the overall training time once simulation-based training was incorporated. Conclusion: Simulation will always provide significant safety and risk-reduction benefits to flight training; however, when considering the practical implications of integrating simulation-based training, the current data provide a cautionary tale that positive outcomes for training efficiency and cost-effectiveness are not always guaranteed. More targeted inquiry is still needed to assist flight schools to properly operationalize the findings from the research literature to effectively integrate simulation into their flight-training curriculums. © 2016 Crown Copyright.","",""

Background: As flight-deck automation is able to process ever more types of information in sophisticated ways to identify situations, it is becoming more realistic for adaptive systems to adapt behavior based on their own authority. Method: A framework was developed to describe the types and characteristics of adaptive system components and was used to perform a risk–benefit analysis to identify potential issues. Subsequently, eight representative adaptive system storyboards were developed for an evaluation with pilots to augment the analysis results and to explore more detailed issues and potential risk mitigations. Results: Analysis identified the principal drivers of adaptive “triggering conditions” risk as complexity and transparency. It also identified the drivers of adaptations risks and benefits as the task level and the level of control versus information adaptation. Conclusion: Pilots did not seem to distinguish between adaptive automation and normal automation if the rules were simple and obvious; however, their perception of risk increased when the level of complexity and opacity of triggering conditions reached a point where its behavior was perceived as nondeterministic. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: In previous research, situation awareness was not measured with valid and reliable instruments. Previous work also evaluated separation assurance and spacing concepts individually, and did not examine weather. Method: Retired ATCos worked en route and transitional sectors. Four operating concepts for separation assurance and spacing were tested based on whether automation or ATCo was responsible for each function. Standard methods for assessing workload and situation awareness were used; performance measures included safety and efficiency. Results: Workload was lowest when both functions were automated; however, situation awareness depended on operating concept and sector. In the en route sector, the highest levels of situation awareness were found for ATCo-managed separation assurance and automation-managed spacing. In the transitional sector, the highest situation awareness occurred when ATCos performed both functions. The numbers of loss of separation were highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance; sector complexity depended on weather, but only for automation-managed separation assurance. Spacing efficiency was highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance, but more communications were required. Conclusion: In air traffic management, separation assurance and spacing functions interact with each other in determining ATCo workload, situation awareness, and performance, depending on sector characteristics and weather. Therefore, evaluations of NextGen-automation solutions must include multiple concepts of operation, and involve different sectors and environmental conditions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This could lead to the assumption that ecological systems are thus inherently unsafe. We argue, however, that the source of this issue is tied to a modeling problem of the work domain. That is, the majority of ecological systems predominantly model the physical or causal structure of the work domain, thereby neglecting the intentional structure. Many complex socio-technical systems contain a mix of causal and intentional constraints-rules, procedures, and regulations-that contribute to safe operations of those systems. The work described in this chapter examines how visualizing intentional information in an ecological synthetic vision display affects pilot behavior, decision making, and safety in a terrain avoidance task. An experiment with 16 professional pilots showed that adding an intentional constraint increased the clearance during terrain avoidance and gave them more insight into the terrain avoidance task, which enabled them to make better tradeoffs between safety and performance. © 2014 Michael A.

We will make the case that the triadic perspective provides a more comprehensive framework for cognitive science, which is especially valuable when considering the pragmatic implications for designing socio-technical systems (for example, designing virtual environments for training). However, the introduction of a “third body” into the cognitive system raises important challenges for both science and application. In this chapter, we will consider some of the challenges of the triadic (three-body) system and will suggest how synthetic task environments can help researchers address these challenges. © 2014 Michael A.

It can be described succinctly as “investigating an accident before it happens.” A hazard is selected, such as two aircraft violating minimum separation standards or an aircraft losing sufficient lift to maintain altitude, and then the scenarios that can lead to that hazardous state are identified. Hazards are informally defined here as precursor states to accidents that the designer never wants the system to get into purposely. The resulting scenarios or potential paths to the hazard are then used to compute the probability of the hazardous state occurring or to design to either eliminate the scenarios or to control or mitigate them. Alternatively, after an accident, hazard analysis techniques can generate the potential scenarios to assist accident investigators in determining the most likely cause. © 2014 Michael A.

A runway incursion is an event where a vehicle or object has entered an active runway without clearance. Many incursions involve other aircraft, but they can also include service vehicles as well as wildlife that can be large or numerous enough to pose a risk to aircraft. This chapter examines the concern over incursions from the unique perspective of the general aviation pilot encountering a runway incursion upon landing. Until such time as runway incursions no longer occurif that were possible-the ability of pilots on approach to detect and avoid an incursion remains an important aspect of runway safety. The following discussion is guided by the results of research where pilots landing a high-fidelity Cessna 172 simulator were faced with an approaching aircraft traveling in the wrong direction on the active runway. Our research is focused on the relationship of pilot age, expertise, and cognition to the outcome of the incursion scenario. © 2014 Michael A. Vidulich, Pamela s. Tsang and John M. Flach.","",""

Being able to work in these conditions is, besides being scientifically rewarding, enormous fun. Our work has been supported for many years by the Air force Office of Scientific Research. Several years ago, Dr Willard Larkin, our program officer, after thinking about the wide range of observations on human performance we had and were carrying out, suggested that we develop a model that provided a unifying explanatory basis for them. This challenge led us to develop a new model of orientation in which the vestibular system is calibrated and its output interpreted in relation to the 1g force acceleration of Earth gravity. The model predicts the results of earlier studies of exposure to non-1g acceleration levels and the illusory changes in visual and self-orientation associated with these exposures. It also makes unique predictions that were verified experimentally. This chapter describes the background experiments and scientific journey with its twists and turns that led to this new model and viewpoint. © 2014 Michael A. Vidulich, Pamela s. Tsang and John M.

Background: Periods of persistent, intensive work demands are known to compromise recovery and attentional capacity. The effects of 4-month MT on salivary cortisol and performance on 2 computer-based cognitive tasks were tested on a military helicopter unit exposed to a prolonged period of high workload. Methods: MT participants were compared to a wait list control group on levels of saliva cortisol and performance on a go–no go test and a test of stimulus-driven attentional capture. Participants also reported mental demands on the go–no go test, time of wakeup, sleep duration, quality of sleep, outcome expectancies, physical activity level, self-perceived mindfulness, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The results from a mixed between–within analysis revealed that the MT participants compared to the control group had a larger pre to post increase in high- and low-cortisol slopes, and decrease in perceived mental demand imposed by the go–no go test.

Background: Operational military environments are demanding that airdrops are increasingly precise while simultaneously protecting Air Force assets through high-altitude drops. Efforts are underway at the Air Force Research Laboratory to minimize the negative effect of human performance variability on high-altitude airdrop accuracy. Precision guidance to the calculated air release point, as presented through the new display, offers potential reduction in flight performance variability. Method: Four U.S. Air Force pilots, current in the C-17, participated in a within-subjects evaluation of the airdrop guidance display. Each pilot was scheduled to fly a total of 16 trials. The out-the-window scene (presented or blanked) effects were also assessed. Results: Results suggest improved performance over existing methods of airdrop guidance as measured by both aircraft position at green light and the comparison between actual and optimal flightpaths. Conclusion: The airdrop guidance display format, tested for precision flight, could significantly reduce flight performance error associated with high-altitude airdrop missions.

Background: Early work on pilot performance assessment focused on measurement models, including the accuracy and reliability of the scores attributed to the human factors variables included. More recent studies investigated the nature of the evidence that flight examiners used. No previous studies were found on how flight examiners assess line pilots’ performance during flight training and examination. Method: This study employed methods typical for cognitive anthropology, combining ethnographic observations of debriefings and interviews, stimulated recall concerning debriefing, and modified think-aloud protocols of assessment of flight episodes. Twenty-three flight examiners from 5 regional airlines were observed and interviewed in 3 contexts. Results: The data revealed that flight examiners used the documentary method, where initial observations are treated as documentary evidence of underlying phenomena (e.g., situational awareness, decision making) while presupposing these phenomena for making and categorizing the observations. Flight examiners, using a variety of techniques, actively create situations for obtaining additional observations that further substantiate the presupposed underlying phenomena. Conclusion: Even when flight examiners use rating scales, their assessment method is based on categorization of facts and, therefore, shares similarities with medical diagnosis.

Background: Nontechnical skills of pilots are crucial for the conduct of safe flight operations. To train and assess these skills, reliable expert ratings are required. Literature shows to some degree that interrater reliability is influenced by factors related to the targets, scenarios, rating tools, or the raters themselves. Method: Thirty-seven type-rating examiners from a European airline assessed the performance of 4 flight crews based on video recordings using LOSA and adapted NOTECHS tools. We calculated r<inf>wg</inf> and ICC(3) to measure within-group agreement and interrater reliability. Results: The findings indicated that within-group agreement and interrater reliability were not always acceptable. It was shown that the performance of outstanding pilots was rated with the highest within-group agreement. For cognitive aspects of performance, interrater reliability was higher than for social aspects of performance. Agreement was lower on the pass–fail level than for the distinguished performance scales. Conclusion: These results suggest pass–fail decisions should not be based exclusively on nontechnical skill ratings. We furthermore recommend that regulatory authorities more systematically address interrater reliability in airline instructor training. Airlines as well as training facilities should be encouraged to demonstrate sufficient interrater reliability when using their rating tools. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Background: Pilots might experience stress when anticipating failure to meet task demands and therefore, higher levels of stress can be used as a trigger for engaging automatic assistance. An unobtrusive measure of stress in aviation might be the grip force pilots exert on the control stick that could increase due to the intensified muscle tonus that characterizes psychological stress. Method: Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group and performed tracking tasks. Participants in the experimental group were told that as of the second half of the experiment their compensation for the experiment would partly depend on their performance. No such conditioning existed for the control group. Grip force was then measured using a sensor on the control stick. Results: Grip force significantly increased in the second half of the experiment in the experimental group, but decreased in the control group. Similar interaction between experimental group and experimental half was also evident with self-reported stress and galvanic skin response (GSR), yet increases within the experimental group were not significant. Grip force also moderately correlated with GSR, possibly suggesting that they responded to the same construct. Conclusion: Findings provided a preliminary indication that grip force could be used to measure stress in aviation, meriting further research exploration. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

All pilots had difficulties in applying the correct recovery template, as their initial response was to counter the wing drop rather than to unload the aircraft. Reproduction of actual g-loads led to significantly longer recoveries, more secondary stick-shaker events, lower maximum load factors, larger altitude loss, and higher speeds.

Mindfulness scores remained higher throughout the follow-up. Time-consuming plenary sessions and the amount of recommended, out-of-class training were found to be potential drawbacks of MT. Overall the findings indicate that MT might be a viable complement to existing mental training for high-performance populations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Criterion data were collected between 1995 and 2008 from 4 training bases across 3 training tracks. Analyses also examined consistency in pilot aptitude and training outcomes. Results were consistent with previous research indicating cognitive ability is the best predictor of pilot training performance. There were few differences across training tracks, bases, and years, and none was large. Overall, results illustrated the consistency of the quality of pilot trainees as assessed by cognitive ability and personality trait measures, and the consistency of these measures in predicting training performance over time. This consistency results in a more stable training system, enabling greater efficiency and effectiveness. © 2014, Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The common goal for both studies was to achieve visual meteorological capacity under instrument meteorological conditions, when landing aircraft on parallel runways 750 ft apart. Using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, both studies investigated procedures related to breakout maneuvers on final approach during off-nominal conditions. The first study investigated procedures for 2 parallel runways (involving a leading and trailing aircraft) and the second study examined 3 parallel runways separated by 750 ft, investigating procedures for 3 simultaneously arriving aircraft (leading, center, and right aircraft). In both studies, off-nominal events were introduced during the approach. In some cases the wake of the leading aircraft drifted too close to the aircraft behind. In others, the leading aircraft deviated off its course and blundered toward the trailing aircraft. Statistical analysis examined the effects of approach echelon (2-runway vs. 3-runway), breakout cause, and breakout location on the dependent measures of breakout trajectory cross-track error, breakout trajectory track angle error, pilot workload, and pilot situation awareness. Although revealing differences between the study conditions, results also show accurate cross-track and track angle error levels (i.e., high levels of breakout trajectory accuracy), manageable pilot workload, and high levels of pilot situation awareness across all conditions in both studies. Results suggest possible avenues of future adaptation of dual and triple parallel runway operations (e.g., improving pilot training) and also show potential promise of the concept. © 2014, Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Learning and novel and complex cognitive tasks involving multiple demands, however, might be impaired. This study evaluated whether complex cognition-as assessed by complex reasoning, multiple memory, and risk judgment-was impaired during mild hypoxia. Using a normobaric single-blind crossover design, 25 healthy nonsmoking male participants breathed normoxic (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.206) or hypoxic air (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.143) equivalent to 2,438 m for 2 hr and performed the following tasks at baseline, 30 min, and 90 min: (a) a complex logical reasoning task that assessed accuracy, response time, and a reasoning quality index for easy (nonconflict valid), difficult (nonconflict invalid), fairly difficult (conflict valid), and very difficult (conflict invalid) syllogisms; (b) a multiple memory test that assessed sentence judgment error, working memory span, and prospective memory; and (c) a simple vigilance psychomotor task that assessed the frequency and mean time that a disc was outside a target area and braking reaction time. They also completed a self-perceived risk judgement questionnaire near the end of each exposure. After 90 min, the mean change in working memory span for mild hypoxia (M = 0.9, SD = 4.6) was significantly less than for normoxia (M = 4.4, SD = 7.2). The reasoning quality index for conflict invalid syllogisms for mild hypoxia (M = 0.22, SD = 0.29) was marginally significantly less than for normoxia (M = 0.39, SD = 0.35). The chances of these findings occurring by chance cannot be discounted, but are small. Although this study suggests that mild hypoxia might impair working memory and complex logical reasoning involving difficult conflicts, further studies using more discerning tests of cognition are warranted. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A validation study with N = 292 ab initio pilots for a major European airline is described, in which assessment center (AC) methods have been compared with questionnaires on social competence and personality. Results show moderate to high correlations between 2 social competence questionnaires and certain personality dimensions, although only 1 social competence questionnaire (the Social Skills Inventory [SSI]) confirms systematic common variance with the behavior-oriented assessments of related concepts in the AC. In addition to traditional selection procedures, the SSI could neither improve the prediction of applicants' overall performance in pilot selection nor did it show substantial intercorrelations with an external criterion in the pilot training. Therefore, social competence and personality questionnaires could serve as an additional component in the preselection, but might not replace the AC, which provides information about the behavioral component of social competence in real social interactions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

We seek to establish a global model based on the results. Previous studies can provide us with an understanding of why aircraft maintenance technicians sometimes do not follow the requisite procedure. Here we use these empirical data and psychological models as a framework, and consider the use by an aircraft maintenance technician of a document specifically as an information-seeking task and as a secondary task. A qualitative survey involving 13 maintenance technicians was conducted, with observations and semidirected interviews. The survey gives preliminary results about why, when, and how technicians use their maintenance documents, and why they sometimes do not use them although they are required to do so. Thus, the decision by an aircraft technician to use or not use a prescribed document in a maintenance operation should be viewed in terms of a conflict among 3 priorities: safety, legality, and efficiency.

One part of the assistance system is the navigation system with automatic flight path planning. The objective of this article is to clarify if pilots perform the planning of flight paths in the same way. An interview with 68 participants was conducted to evaluate essential differences between the pilots' cognitive processes and build a basis for the user-centered design of the navigation system. The interview assessed user-specific requirements that can be used as input for the path planning algorithms. The results recommend the usage of individual pilot requirements for path planning applications. With individually adjusted navigation systems, the potential mismatch between pilots' expectations and the actually computed flight paths is expected to be minimized. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.

A first step in predicting how future changes will impact flight crews and ATC is to examine the current system and to pinpoint problematic areas that could be ameliorated or exacerbated by advanced automation and heavier traffic density. In this study, we coded Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports identified as having communication conflicts between pilots and ATC. Results describe types of conflict, operational context, phase of flight, operator states, and situations conducive to communication conflicts, risk perception differences, and inappropriate resolution strategies. Reports suggest that high workload approach and landing phases are conducive to communication conflicts, that different interpretations of the same information might lead to conflict, and that operator state could impact communication and collaboration between flight crews and ATC. A specific problem was noted when reporters felt that the affective response of the other party was not appropriate to the situation. Although this study reflects the limitations inherent in ASRS data, it can provide insights into potential problem areas and conflict triggers in NextGen operations.

Results indicated that higher risk-taking tendency was associated with low scores on both the delayed risk and immediate high risk components of risk perception, and with lower levels of self-confidence and safety orientation attitudes. Higher risk-taking tendency was also associated with higher risk attitude scores and involvement in hazardous events. Results suggest that aviator risk management training programs are needed to modify attitudes and risk perception, especially in older and experienced pilots and instructors who are more exposed to risky flying. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In what way can a flight crew mediate problems? How are we to understand reported errors? Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety presents recent findings in aviation psychology, bringing fresh insights to such questions. Aviation psychologists study personnel selection and training; they evaluate the management of flight operations, and ultimately they analyse the things that went wrong. The strong interrelation between these components allows us to talk about a chain of safety. This volume appraises this chain of safety by considering the mechanisms that determine its effectiveness - input mechanisms, coping mechanisms and control mechanisms. Each contribution discusses a component of the chain while the book as a whole emphasizes and illustrates that understanding the connections between these parts is essential for the future. By addressing these issues the book leads to further considerations such as how mistakes are linked to training and how coping mechanisms should help us to understand errors and accidents. Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety will appeal to aviation professionals (human factors experts, safety managers, pilots, ATCOs, air navigation service providers, etc.) and academics, researchers, graduates and postgraduates in human factors and psychology. Although primarily written for the aviation industry, this book will also be of interest to other high-risk dynamic activities that face similar challenges: the need to present effective and safe outcomes to the public in general and the stakeholders in particular. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C.

Today, pilots can directly access these same weather products from their own computers, aircraft cockpits, and mobile devices, and choose to skip the services offered by weather briefers. A sample of 191 general aviation pilots completed a survey designed to determine how frequently they directly access weather products, how frequently they still consult with weather briefers, and which weather products pilots use and why. We identified a subset of surveyed pilots who usually or always rely solely on directly accessed weather products (approximately 25%). Although these self-briefing pilots trend toward holding higher grades of pilot certificates and make greater use of cockpit weather systems, they do not differ from other pilots in the weather products they review, and they prefer simple weather observations to more complex forecasts and descriptions of larger weather systems such as fronts and pressure regions. We explore the reasons why self-briefing pilots choose to review the products they do, and how the next generation of pilots might best be trained and supported. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The objective of this research was to investigate techniques for measuring subjective perceptions of clutter and to model the predicted impacts of clutter on pilot performance within the context of advanced flight deck technologies. Six commercial pilots flew simulated approaches under varied workload conditions with low-, medium-, and high-clutter head-up displays, rating the perceived clutter and subjective mental workload associated with each display configuration. Results revealed that high-clutter displays produced elevated reports of perceived clutter and workload due to information density or redundancy, whereas low-clutter displays were perceived as less cluttered but challenging to use due to lack of relevant information typically used during flight. A multidimensional measure of clutter was found to be more sensitive to display differences than an overall perceived rating of clutter, and low-level visual display properties were successful in predicting clutter perceptions and pilot performance. Finalized products of this research could support optimized display design through the identification of clutter thresholds and the implementation of clutter alerts, decluttering mechanisms, or both, and could be used to support display certification and acquisitions processes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules) modeling methods have been used in human-computer interaction (HCI) analysis for many years and are considered easy to learn. GOMS has several limitations, including representing only expert behavior in tasks and not supporting detailed modeling of visual and motor operations or parallel processing. Another limitation is that operation time estimates are deterministic. This research developed an enhanced GOMS language and computational cognitive modeling tool to address the existing GOMS limitations to aid cockpit automation designers in assessing the potential for automation-induced pilot performance problems. Output of the tool for a specific flight and automation use scenario was compared with experiment data for validation purposes. Results demonstrated significant correlations of model-based pilot performance and cognitive workload predictions with observations on pilots using a flight simulator.

Combat aircraft advances have led to dramatic increases in the operational tempo facing the pilot, increasing the likelihood for situation awareness (SA) failures, biases, and information overload. Prior research suggests that adaptive interface might help to address this issue. We designed and evaluated 2 interfaces targeted at problem areas for pilots: a weapons employment zone (WEZ) display designed to support awareness of combat geometry, and an adaptive border display (ABD) designed to warn pilots of impending border infractions breaking rules of engagement. Two experiments were conducted under various levels of scenario complexities to test the ability of these displays to improve SA, reduce workload, and improve objective performance in a population of licensed civilian pilots. Study 1 results showed that the WEZ display significantly improved both performance and SA, and reduced workload. However, there were no significant effects of the ABD. In the second study, we used substantially more complex scenarios to investigate the effect of the ABD. Results showed that in these situations, the ABD had a significant effect on improving pilot performance. The results demonstrate the value of adaptive visualizations that highlight key aspects of the environment that impact performance. Although the results have verified the benefits of adaptive displays, more sensitive performance measures and diverse test pilots are suggested in the future to provide more confidence in applying these findings. Potential application of this research includes modern aircraft cockpit interface design under complex combat scenarios. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Correction for measurement error was applied. The results revealed an overall transfer effect in favor of motion (d = 0.51). Effects were weaker in true transfer (d = 0.10) than in quasi-transfer with different (d = 0.73) and identical (d = 1.19) motion, stronger for helicopter (d = 0.86) and disturbance tasks (d = 0.84) than for maneuvering fixed-wing aircraft (d = 0.07), and stronger for subjects without flight experience (d = 1.57) than for pilots with intermediate (d = 0.53) and expert (d = -0.01) experience.

We investigated whether the maximum of test information corresponded to the cutoff zone for 10 cognitive ability tests of the current French civil air transport pilot selection (n = 577). An item response theory model was fitted to the data. The 6 adequately fitted tests' test information curves were generally maximal in the cutoff score zone.

In a scenario, SA was hampered by introducing a system malfunction in the form of a fuel leak that resulted in a fuel imbalance. Twelve airline pilots participated in the experiment. An eye tracker was used to track the pilot's visual scanning behavior across the areas of interest (AoIs) in the cockpit. Differences in attentional focus and scanning entropy were observed when the crews searched for the malfunction. The results provided insight into the use of fixation rates and dwell times as information acquisition indicators (Level 1 SA), and the use of entropy as an indicator of new information acquisition activities (Level 3 SA). These findings contribute to the further development and exploration of eye movement analyses as an objective indicator of SA in a civil aviation cockpit setting. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A number of tools have been developed in recent years to help pilots visualize the actual and forecast weather for their planned flight. In this study we compare the effectiveness of a graphic weather visualization tool designed for preflight decision making with conventional coded reports and plain English translations. Qualified pilots from several aero clubs were asked to view 4 hypothetical cross-country flights. Departure and destination weather reports (METARs) were provided for each flight in 1 of 4 formats-code, plain English, graphic, or both graphic and plain English. Following a short interference task, the pilots were asked to recall as much of the weather information as possible. Results showed that pilots correctly recalled most information from the dual graphic and plain English display but this was largely attributable to the additional time required to process the 2 displays. Although the formats were rated as equally interpretable, experienced pilots were able to recall much more from the traditional coded METARs than less experienced pilots. Implications for the design and acceptance of novel display formats of meteorological information for pilots are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A comparison was made between surface warfare officers (SWOs) who had and had not attended BRM training. The responses of the SWOs were also compared to CRM-trained U.S. Naval aviators.

Performance using a medium fidelity air traffic control simulator was investigated across 2 proportions of free-flying traffic and 3 types of decision support. Conflict resolution performance was significantly degraded when free-flying aircraft failed to negotiate a conflict and controllers had to intervene. Conflict resolution performance varied across the aiding condition and was superior when negotiation information was provided.

Efficient alerts provide information that is uniquely identifiable with one aspect of the aircraft's behavior and do not form a nuisance by being too intrusive and overly persistent. It is known that excessive auditory alert intensity can impair human performance; however, simply lowering alert intensity is not sufficient because there is a need to ensure detection and safety are not compromised. In an attempt to address this problem, an automated alert system, the Intelligent Alert Presentation system, was constructed. The system analyzes flight deck noise in real time, and alerts are then presented at a fixed ratio above the noise (+10 dBA). The system has alert muting capabilities that can be activated following detection. The intensity is attenuated to -5 dBA below the noise level, where the signal is partially masked but remains detectable and comprehensive, according to the findings of 2 experiments reported here.

The TDL is the mental workload imposed by the system to be controlled, and is not to be mistaken for the mental workload experienced by the operator, referred to as mental load. This article presents the results of preliminary research that focused on how some of the environmental factors that determine the approach, such as the type of aircraft and the meteorological conditions, affect the TDL. A paper pilot model, consisting of a scanning model, mental model, and control model, was used to quantify how hard an average pilot has to work to conduct the specified approach. Offline computer simulations with this model revealed some clear trends in pilot scanning rate, task error, and control activity, as a function of the environmental factors, which will eventually allow for a prediction and quantification of the TDL. Depending on the approach performance requirements on the one hand, and the pilot scanning capacity on the other, increasing turbulence intensity showed a change in trend for all TDL-related parameters at a particular turbulence intensity. Results from a pilot- in-the-loop evaluation, conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator, supported the main trends of the offline simulation trials. They also indicated that through adopting different scanning strategies, pilots can leverage their workload; more research is necessary to clarify this result, however. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Differences in heart rate during rejected takeoff and engine failure indicate that the increase of workload starts in advance of an “unexpected” event in the simulator where it seems to be of preparatory nature, whereas in the aircraft it is more connected to management of the situation. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

A problem with decelerating approaches, however, is that they typically lead to increased spacing, which in turn results in a significant reduction of runway landing capacity. A possible solution to this problem might be to delegate the task of separating the aircraft during the approach to the pilot. To aid the pilot, an algorithm has been developed that predicts the trajectory of the preceding aircraft and optimizes the flap schedule based on this prediction. Offline simulations indicate that using this system runway throughput numbers of up to 98% of the capacity of a conventional instrument landing system (ILS) approach can be achieved (Ren & Clarke, 2003). To assess practical implementation issues and to investigate pilot appreciation, a piloted experiment was conducted, for which a pilot support interface has been developed that presents the future separation information in an intuitive fashion. The experiment showed that it is indeed possible for pilots to perform the spacing task while flying a TDDA. The pilot support interface significantly reduces pilot workload when compared to a baseline display. Also the effects of off-nominal lead pilot behavior on pilot performance are reduced by the use of online flap schedule optimization and separation prediction. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Unfortunately, recent research has shown that those currently in practice do not have sufficient knowledge of the aging process and age specific issues of older adults. To address these deficits the American Psychological Association published a report outlining six general concepts: attitudes, general knowledge about adult development, clinical issues, assessment, intervention, and education. These concepts are described. Furthermore, this article extends the current thinking on ethical issues regarding older adults by addressing their vulnerabilities. In addition, ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, and elder abuse are addressed as they apply to both clinical and research situations.

The data we present herein are a synthesis of prior work and may be useful for consideration by SVS designers and certification entities. Pilots flew off-path tasks, following the middle of a curved valley depicted on the SVS. The SVS parameters were manipulated between runs and cross-track deviations from the desired path following the middle of the valley were recorded. Off-path terrain navigation tasks were used to isolate the effect of the different SVS terrain depictions on cross-track error without the overriding effects of other flight guidance symbology. For off-path SVS operations and based on the results presented in this article, we recommend an SVS head-down display resolution of about 105 pixels per inch (ppi; 32.7 pixels per degree of visual angle) or better at a viewing distance of 21 in., a field of regard of 60 degrees, a terrain data density of 6 arc sec or better, a two-color checkerboard or elevation-based coloring scheme (or a combination thereof), and Gouraud shading of the texture. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Several tunnel-in-the-sky and pathway-in-the-sky concepts including scene-linking elements have been evaluated. Pathway-in-the-sky displays enable pilots to accurately fly difficult trajectories. However, these displays may drive pilots' attention to the aircraft guidance task at the expense of other tasks, particularly when the pathway display is located head-down. A pathway head-up display (HUD) might be a viable solution to overcome this disadvantage. Moreover, the pathway might mitigate the perceptual segregation between the static near domain and the dynamic far domain and hence might improve attention switching between both sources. To more comprehensively overcome the perceptual near-to-far domain disconnect, alphanumeric symbols could be attached to the pathway leading to an HUD design concept called scene linking. A scene-linked pathway-predictor concept was implemented on a monocular retinal scanning head-mounted device (HMD) in combination with an optical head tracker. The evaluation comprises low-fidelity part-task simulations, high-fidelity simulator runs, and flight trials. Where laboratory experiments found evidence in favor of scene-linked pathway HUDs or HMDs, the real flight tests could not fully support this display concept. Even so, in all studies evidence has been found that the head-up pathway concept could be superior to current head-up solutions. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This study examined the influence of format (i.e., headings and story structure) on memory for aviation occurrence briefs. In accordance with Seifert et al.'s (1994) predictive features model, it was hypothesized that participants who read occurrence briefs written in a predictive format (i.e., emphasizing the complication feature in heading and story layout) would have better memory for the briefs than participants who read briefs written in a standard format (i.e., similar to traditional occurrence briefs that emphasize setting and outcome features). Thirty-two nonpilot participants read either a predictive or a standard magazine reporting 5 occurrence briefs. Participants evaluated the magazines and completed a sentence recognition test. Although the magazines received similar evaluations, participants who read the predictive briefs had significantly higher recognition scores, but significantly lower confidence levels, than participants who read the standard briefs. These results suggest that occurrence briefs should be presented in a predictive format to enhance memory for reports. Copyright © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Frequency of occurrence, importance ratings, and type of paper used were recorded. In addition, perceived benefits of marks made on the paper were assessed using open item responses and a series of Likert-scale questions. The positions varied in the marks the controllers made and in their reasons for making the marks. FD/CD controllers tended to make marks because they reduced workload or aided communication. LC tended to make marks because they aided memory, organization, and situation awareness. GC proved to be an interesting hybrid of the FD/CD and LC.

External aids such as note-taking help pilots manage communication demands, and may especially benefit older pilots. Emerging technologies provide new opportunities for external aids that are integrated with other systems. We compared an electronic notepad (epad) positioned next to the instrument panel of a flight simulator to conventional note-taking (kneepad) on a read-back task. In Experiment 1, 6 older and 6 younger instrument-rated pilots listened to and read back ATC messages while using the epad, kneepad, or no aid. Epad use in this communication-only condition was compared to a condition in which pilots used the epad to support communication while flying the simulator. Read-back accuracy was higher when pilots used either aid compared to no aid, and the pattern of results suggested a smaller age difference with either aid than in the no-aid condition. Accuracy supported by the epad was not reduced in the multitask condition, suggesting the epad would support communication during flight. In Experiment 2, 12 younger and 12 older pilots performed the same tasks, with a modified epad interface. Further evidence was found for smaller age differences when communication was supported by either aid. The results replicate note-taking benefits for older pilots' communication (Morrow et al., 2003) and extend this finding to the novel epad.","",""

The putative mechanism for this increase in safety is that previously demonstrated improvements in lateral and vertical control of the aircraft in flight should carry over to the landing situation. Alternatively, it is possible that, during approach and landing, the HUD might affect the pilot's ability to assimilate outside cues at the decision height, thereby reducing the success ratio for landings using an HUD. This article reports a pair of experiments that test these competing hypotheses. Taking advantage of the opportunity when an air transport operator introduced HUD in an existing aircraft fleet, we were able to use a Boeing 737-700 full-motion simulator flown by commercial airline pilots. We explored the effects of (a) HUD use, (b) ambient visibility, and (c) length of approach lighting on the size and location of the touchdown footprint. We also explored the effects of HUD use on approach success ratio. HUD use reduced the width of the touchdown footprint in all tested visibility and lighting conditions, including visibility below the minimum allowed. HUD use had no effect on the length of the touchdown footprint. We could not detect any decrease in approach success rate for HUD approaches. Based on these empirical data, the minimum visibility for approaches using HUDs could be set lower than for approaches without an HUD. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.","",""

The 2 team situation awareness scores (1 from the high-fidelity simulation and 1 from the low-fidelity simulation) were also significantly correlated (r = .43, p < .05). These findings and related information are discussed in relation to the use of the measurements in situation awareness training for low experience level pilots.

The current practice to define the tunnel reference trajectory as a concatenation of straight and circular segments, however, leads to difficult transition maneuvers between these segments, strongly contributing to pilot workload. To achieve a smooth interception, clothoid transition paths can be inserted between the straight and circular sections. A clothoid function defines a trajectory curvature that changes from 0 (a straight trajectory) to the desired curvature (the circular trajectory) in a certain amount of space traveled. Because the reference path better matches the natural aircraft response, the clothoid transients are hypothesized to make the task of flying complex curved approaches easier. A pilot-in-the-loop experiment, conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator, confirms this hypothesis and shows that clothoid-augmented trajectories yield improved path-following performance, require fewer pilot control actions, and result in higher comfort levels.

In an online survey, it was observed that 98% of respondents either failed to or could not accurately calculate the runway crosswind component from air traffic control (ATC) reports passed using the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard phraseology; the majority of pilots also severely underestimated the crosswind strength. Furthermore, nearly 30% of these respondents could not recall or inaccurately recalled the crosswind limit of their aircraft. In a 2nd study using a series of approach and landing trials in a general aviation simulator, wind reports were passed to participants using either the standard ICAO format or in a modified format, where the runway crosswind component was explicitly stated. The results showed that for the group receiving wind reports in the standard format, the mental arithmetic associated with calculating the runway crosswind impaired flying performance. As with the online survey, these calculations were also performed poorly. These results suggest that ATC reports on the approach should be amended to specifically include the runway crosswind component and that all aircraft should have their crosswind limit clearly indicated in the cockpit.

This research examined multiple cognitive workload measures, including secondary task performance and physiological (cardiac) measures, as inputs to a neural network for operator functional state classification during a simulated air traffic control (ATC) task. Twenty-five participants performed a low-fidelity simulation under manual control or 1 of 4 different forms of automation. Traffic volume was either low (3 aircraft) or high (7 aircraft). Participants also performed a secondary (gauge) monitoring task. Results demonstrated significant effects of traffic volume (workload) on aircraft clearances (p < .01) and trajectory conflicts (p < .01), secondary task performance (p < .01), and subjective ratings of task workload (p < .01). The form of ATC automation affected the number of aircraft collisions (p < .05), secondary task performance (p < .01), and heart rate (HR; p < .01). However, heart rate and heart rate variability measures were not sensitive to the traffic manipulation. Neural network models of controller workload (defined in terms of traffic volume) were developed using the secondary task performance and simple heart rate measure as inputs. The best workload classification accuracy using a genetic algorithm (across all forms of ATC automation) was 64%, comparable to prior work. Additional neural network models of workload for each mode of ATC automation revealed substantial variability in predictive accuracy, based on the characteristics of the automation. Secondary task performance was a highly sensitive indicator of ATC workload, whereas the heart rate measure appeared to operate as a more global indicator of workload. A limited range of cardiac response might be sufficient for the demands of the brain in ATC. The results have applicability to design of future adaptive systems integrating neural-network-based workload state classifiers for multiple forms of automation.

The mean age of the respondents was 28.9 years (SD - 3.7) with an average military service of 7.2 years. The majority of the aircrew tended to sleep more in the afternoon and longer in the night on holidays and weekends. One third of the aircrew believed that they could perform in peak efficiency even with 1 to 2 hr sleep loss. A similar number stated that they had felt sleepy or drowsy in the cockpit due to sleep deprivation. Aircrew rated decreased attention, increased reaction time, lapses in concentration, and poor aircraft handling as important outcomes of fatigue. Tea or coffee was the preferred countermeasure. They were unanimous in the felt need for more information dissemination on fatigue. There appears to be complacency among aircrew who believe that they may be able to operate with full efficiency despite 1 to 2 hr of sleep loss.

The degradation of the multiple-sensory information that is normally available often results in control difficulties and a lack of situation awareness. Extending the visual interface to a multi-sensory interface could allow the tele-operator to better perceive and integrate the information about the environment and its constraints. The use of force feedback through a haptic control device allows the operator to perceive information of the environment through the sense of touch. This would complement the visual information and is hypothesized to increase situation awareness, especially in situations where visual information is insufficient. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel virtual force field that maps environment constraints to virtual forces on a control stick. The force field was designed in such a way that its size and shape, hence the field sensitivity, could be determined through adjustments of its parameters.

Results show that the haptic interface reduces the amount of collisions considerably, contributing to a higher level of safety when a complex task needs to be performed with limited visual information.

Research indicated, however, that terrain collisions may still occur for aircraft equipped with these systems. Synthetic vision allows for perception of the environment, but lacks properties to support understanding and extrapolation of the perceived data. A terrain warning system provides elementary meaning to the environment, but is not well integrated into synthetic vision displays. To further increase terrain awareness and, ultimately, eliminate terrain collisions, synthetic vision should be integrated with a terrain awareness functionality that allows the pilot to be continuously informed about how the external constraints (imposed by the terrain) relate to the internal aircraft constraints (e.g., climb performances). Based on that information, pilots can judge for themselves what an obstacle actually means to them in terms of possibilities to fly over it, and if not, what the alternatives for action are. In this article, the paradigm of ecological interface design is used to analyze the aircraft manual control task in the vertical plane and to develop a more meaningful interface for (vertical) terrain awareness.

The findings indicated that judgments of the position of the touchdown point made while the airplane is turning are underestimated in distance, whereas judgments made while the airplane is on a straight approach to the touchdown point are overestimated. In most cases, the windmilling propeller decreased touchdown point judgment accuracy. In addition, pilot experience was associated with improved judgment accuracy during the turning approaches. The presented environmental structure had a weak and inconsistent effect. Copyright © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.","",""

This study investigated mode awareness by measuring eye point of gaze of both pilots during simulated commercial flights, while recording call-outs and tracking aircraft performance. The results of this study show that the compliance to manufacturer or air carrier procedures regarding mode monitoring and call-outs was very low. However, this did not seem to have a negative effect on the flight path or safety during our observations. Crews exhibited a proliferation of strategies to keep track of status and behavior of the automation, often with little reliance on the flight mode annunciations of the primary flight display. The data confirm the limitations of current flight mode annunciator designs, and suggest that mode awareness is a more complex phenomenon than what can be captured by measuring eye point of gaze and communication alone.

Twenty flight tasks supported by the FMS were analyzed using a cognitive stage model (Sherry, Polson, Feary, & Palmer, 2002) to identify steps with the potential for errors. If a step was found not to have visual cues such as labels or prompts for the required action sequence it was identified as a recall step and a potential source of difficulty. If the action was supported by salient labels and prompts it was identified as a recognition step. Actual pilots using an FMS were observed and performance and errors categorized into the related task step. The greatest amount of observed difficulty was accessing the correct function, labeled as an access error. This process was found to be particularly vulnerable to recall problems. Pilots had the likelihood of .74 for committing an access error on tasks with 2 recalled access steps. This is compared to .13 for 1 recalled access step and .06 for no recalled access steps. Errors associated with formatting, inserting, or verifying entries were less common than access errors; however, these errors primarily occurred on tasks in which recall steps were required for the related step. A total of 93% of the format errors, 80% of the insert errors, and 81% of the verify errors occurred on the tasks that did not have good recognition support for each associated step.

Construct validity was assessed using only private pilots (N = 369).

This article investigates pilot decision making in the anticipatory task of intercepting a curved section of the trajectory. A fixed-base simulator experiment was run to study the pilot's timing of the curve interception maneuver. Different tunnel display geometries, aircraft types, and flight speeds were simulated. Presenting the tunnel frames allows pilots to use a tau (time-to-contact) strategy afforded by the expansion of the tunnel frames to determine the time-to-go to the curve. Presenting only the tunnel outline induces the use of the tangent point, the innermost point of the curve, to time the maneuver, a strategy reported in automobile driving research. It is shown that the display formats presenting the tunnel frames yield consistent timing behavior and were preferred by pilots. Presenting only the tunnel outline resulted in large variations in conducting the maneuver accompanied by a poor path-following performance and a high pilot workload. Hence, tunnel displays are recommended to include a sufficient number of frames near the transitions between curved and straight sections. Copyright © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.","",""

The program consisted of an Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise in which research participants learn through operant conditioning techniques to regulate several physiological responses to suppress their symptoms. We evaluated training progress during rotating-chair motion sickness tests. We assessed motion sickness tolerance by calculating the number of cumulative rotations that research participants were able to achieve in the rotating chair prior to reaching their major malaise endpoint. We rated motion sickness symptoms using a standard diagnostic scale. We obtained physiological data from one pilot during a training flight in an F-18 aircraft after completion of his training. Results demonstrate a significant increase in tolerance to laboratory-induced motion sickness tests and a reduction in autonomic nervous system response levels following training. During subsequent flight qualification tests on F-18 and T-38 aircraft, both pilots were successful at controlling their airsickness and were returned to active flight status.","",""

These states cannot be changed independent of each other through the aircraft control devices, the elevator and the throttle. Rather, to effectively change an aircraft's speed and altitude, the controls have to be coordinated. The mediating mechanism that underlies the coordination of the controls is the management of the aircraft's energy state. This article shows that the abstraction hierarchy (AH; Rasmussen, 1986) framework can be effectively used to gain more insight into the underlying structure of the aircraft energy management problem. The derived AH representation is based on the analysis of the energy constraints on the control task. It reveals the levels of abstraction necessary to link the aircraft's physical controls to the speed and altitude goals and also how the aircraft energy is a critical mediating state of the control problem. Energy awareness can be increased by presenting explicit energy management information. The powerful and novel concepts of the total energy reference profile and energy angle are introduced in this article and applied in the context of a perspective flight-path display. The resulting display presents energy management information fully integrated with the tunnel-in-the-sky display and reveals 5 new and important energy cues, intuitively linking the controls and the goals.

The amount of fatigue experienced by the aviators in an operational EP-3 squadron was quantified before and after interventions were made to promote crew rest. Surveys were completed for 10 days by 2 separate flight crews transitioning to a Southwest Asia detachment site from Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington. The second crew (Crew B) underwent fatigue countermeasures training several days prior to departure and were provided with 1 additional layover day between the second and third day of transit. The additional layover period was provided in an effort to maximize crew rest prior to a difficult night transit 3 days into the journey. The surveys quantified: self-reported sleep quantity, sleep quality, sleep debt, and fatigue ratings during the 3 phases of flight: takeoff to top of climb, top of climb to top of descent, and top of descent to landing. Baseline data were collected from the first crew (Crew A) and were then compared to that of the second crew (Crew B). Crew A experienced greater fatigue, a larger sleep debt, and decreased sleep quality compared to Crew B. Both crews demonstrated low sleep quality ratings on the second day of the transit as well as high fatigue ratings after the third leg of the transit. Crew B received more total sleep prior to the third leg of the transit due to the additional layover day. This additional rest period resulted in decreased fatigue ratings for Crew B. Sleep quality tended to be lower on the nights preceding a scheduled flight and higher on days off.

Five decision strategies were found, ranging from cognitively intensive but precise to fast and frugal but robust. We provide evidence for the model by comparing its behavior to a National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center simulation of Chicago O'Hare surface operations. Decision horizons were highly variable; the model selected the most accurate strategy given the time available.

It provided an opportunity to examine how the use of a CDTI influences pilot/controller operational communications. Departure profiles were established to evaluate the ability of flight crews and air traffic controllers to manage long (6 nautical miles [nm]) and short (4.5 nm) spacing intervals between departing aircraft. Approximately 4% of the departures conducted when CDTI was not used and 9% when it was involved communication problems. Fortunately, controllers and pilots detected and corrected these problems in midstream. When pilots executed CDTI departures, there was an overall increase in time on frequency, more time spent under local control during the day, and departures were completed in less time when assigned the short spacing interval.","",""

Results of the review indicate that few formally documented efforts have been made to assess safety culture within the aviation industry. Furthermore, there exists considerable disagreement among safety professionals, both within and across industries, as to how safety culture should be defined and whether or not safety culture is inherently different from the concept of safety climate. We conducted a synthesis of these different perspectives. We provide a discussion of key organizational indicators of safety culture and the various methods commonly used to assess these factors. We also present issues that need to be considered when implementing a safety culture assessment program. The hope is that this review will enable researchers and safety professionals to better understand and assess safety culture and that it will facilitate the sharing of information and strategies for improving safety culture across organizations and industries.","",""

Subject matter experts were used to generate a scoring key from the alternatives that the experts recommended for a typical GA pilot.

Results from that first study showed that the test had acceptable psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency and distribution.

Analyses resulted in the reduction of the test to 39 items, with an internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of .747. Construct validation was accomplished through correlation with a measure of the number of times the participant had been involved in an accident or other hazardous aviation event. Pilots who had higher (better) scores on the SJT were found to have experienced fewer hazardous events, which was taken as supporting the construct validity of the test.

Fifteen certified flight instructor pilots flew a Frasca flight simulator with full visual display of the outside world, through a series of ATC-instructed maneuvers, while scanning outside for traffic. ATC instructions, of various lengths, were delivered through a text based data link display, through synthesized voice (similar to the current system), or through a redundant voice-text format. Pilots read back the instructions and then complied with whatever maneuver was instructed, while monitoring for traffic. Visual scanning was measured. The results revealed that the visual display provided greatest accuracy of communications readback, and was least disruptive of both traffic monitoring and flight path tracking. The auditory-only condition was most disruptive of these tasks, in part because the pilot's visual attention was drawn into the cockpit for longer periods while note taking, when compared with the visual text display.

This resulted, in part, because the arrival of the discrete auditory communications appeared to disrupt performance of the ongoing visual flight task. Across all conditions, the pilots allocated approximately 60% of their visual attention to monitoring the instrument panel and their communications accuracy was degraded by the longer ATC instructions. The results are interpreted in terms of mechanisms of attention and working memory in information processing, and in terms of the pilot's task priority hierarchy.","",""

The aim of this study was to examine the nature of in-flight weather-related decision making in a task involving assessments of in-flight weather conditions. Pilots examined 10 photographic images of weather conditions taken during flight and were asked to judge whether it would be possible to continue the flight along the current track and altitude and remain in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). As part of their assessments, respondents were also asked to indicate the extent to which they used various cues. The results indicated that experts and novices appear to use in-flight cues differently, although this did not appear to influence perceptions concerning the possibility of flight under VMC.

The analysis reveals important differences in the information as compared to the task of tracking straight trajectories investigated in a companion paper (Mulder, 2003). The optical gradients of perspective and compression that support pilot control behavior in straight tunnels are less useful in curved tunnels. First, curved trajectories yield no vanishing point or any other stationary optical invariant that can act as a reference for the change in the optical information. Second, only the optical gradients conveyed by the nearby elements of the tunnel provide valuable information about the aircraft locomotion. Third, due to the limitations of using a perspective display, the projection of a curved tunnel results in a biased pilot perception of the aircraft position and motion relative to the trajectory. The lower information-content of the display makes curved trajectories more difficult to follow than straight trajectories, deteriorating pilot path-following performance. A simulator experiment provides substantial evidence for these findings.","",""

Associations between pain and personal and flight-related characteristics were explored to determine whether any of these factors increased the risk of pain. Participants consisted of 174 pilots from 45 aerodromes around the United Kingdom and Ireland. Pain and discomfort was reported by 53% of the pilots. The most common pain was reported in the lower back, where it occurred daily or at least weekly, and was of mild to moderate intensity. Pain generally onset after 90 min of flying, and had subsided within 12 hr postflight, although the majority of pain had subsided within 60 min. The occurrence of pain and discomfort was positively correlated with both total flight experience and annual flight hours. Most flight-related pain was caused by postural fatigue and static stress, because most pain was mild and transient, subsiding rapidly postflight, and was unrelated to age. The use of personal lumbar supports is recommended as the most effective short-term solution to reduce back pain and discomfort.","",""

Past research has shown the potential of this advanced form of automation to enhance pilot engagement and lower cognitive workload. However, there have been concerns voiced regarding issues, such as automation surprises, associated with the use of adaptive automation. This study examined the use of psychophysiological self-regulation training with adaptive automation that may help pilots deal with these problems through the enhancement of cognitive resource management skills. Eighteen participants were assigned to 3 groups (self-regulation training, false feedback, and control) and performed resource management, monitoring, and tracking tasks from the Multiple Attribute Task Battery. The tracking task was cycled between 3 levels of task difficulty (automatic, adaptive aiding, manual) on the basis of the electroencephalogram-derived engagement index. The other two tasks remained in automatic mode that had a single automation failure. Those participants who had received self-regulation training performed significantly better and reported lower National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores than participants in the false feedback and control groups. The theoretical and practical implications of these results for adaptive automation are discussed.","",""

A standard interface (conventional controls and displays), a candidate interface (alternative controls and displays), and an adaptive interface (dynamically alternating between the standard and candidate displays) were evaluated. The results indicate that significant performance advantages in the quality of route navigation were obtained with the candidate and adaptive interfaces relative to the standard interface; no significant differences between the candidate and adaptive interfaces were obtained. The implications of these results are discussed, with special emphasis on their relation to fundamental challenges that must be met for the DAI concept to be a viable design alternative.","",""

A mathematical model for glide-slope perception was published recently based on the premise that a desirable goal of perception is to form a perception with minimal uncertainty. One of the qualitative predictions of that model was that changes in the aspect ratio of the runway would affect the perceived glide-slope. In this article, the predictions of the model are quantified and are shown to be in close agreement with experimental results in the literature.","","aerospace medicine; aircraft; article; aviation; bioengineering; decision making; depth perception; distance perception; human; information processing; instrumentation; orientation; perception; psychological model; vision; visual illusion; Aerospace Medicine; Aircraft; Aviation; Data Display; Depth Perception; Distance Perception; Human Engineering; Humans; Judgment; Models, Psychological; Optical Illusions; Orientation; Size Perception; Visual Perception"

An air traffic control simulator was used to manipulate traffic loads and traffic complexity. A mature stage of free flight was simulated by having controllers monitor self-separating aircraft. Four 30-min scenarios were created to combine moderate (11 aircraft) and heavy traffic loads (17 aircraft) in a 50-mile radius sector with the presence or absence of self-separating and conflicting aircraft. Conflicts (defined as a loss of separation of 5 nm laterally and 1,000 ft vertically) were indicated to the controller by the appearance of a red circle around each of the aircraft involved. A self-separation event was defined as an evasive maneuver (either altitude or speed change) made by 1 aircraft to avoid a potential conflict with another aircraft. Performance and workload measurements indicated that controllers had difficulty both in detecting conflicts and in recognizing self-separating events in a timely manner in saturated airspace. Controller mental workload also increased, as indexed both by subjective and secondary task measures.

This article describes some of the findings from a comprehensive questionnaire survey of civil flight deck crew carried out to locate user requirements for the next generation of warning systems. Because the participants in the study were from 10 different fleets (thus representing a range of warning systems from the older fixed static systems to the modern multifunction ones), it is possible to consider whether the development of warning systems has been successful from the point of view of the user. Pilot views on the provision of earlier detection of abnormal conditions, the completeness of warning information, the consequences of crew actions, the prioritization of warning information, and the facility to interrogate the system to make predictions are reported. It is concluded that warning systems have developed in accordance with crew opinion and that given the prevalence of human error on the flight deck, issues of information management and presentation in the next generation of warning systems will be of paramount importance.

Yet, most modern systems are not equipped with the skills required to contribute effectively and in a timely manner to the exchange of information on commitments and actions. In particular, systems fail to provide external attentional guidance to their operators in the case of uncommanded changes and events, which can lead to automation surprises and, sometimes, incidents and accidents. To a large extent, these problems can be explained by designers' increasing reliance on automation feedback that requires focal visual attention.

Two elements of pictorial detail, a visible runway outline and ground texture, are considered in this article. An experiment is described in which the participants were required to initiate the landing maneuver during a simplified aircraft-landing task. This experiment was developed with 2 goals in mind: The first objective was to determine whether performance was influenced by the addition of ground texture; a second objective was to find out whether participants based their timing of the initiation of the landing maneuver on altitude perception or on the so-called time-to-contact (TTC; Lee, 1974). In the landing case, TTC is defined as the time remaining to the moment that the wheels make contact with the runway if no pilot action is taken. The results of the experiment show that landing performance is improved when ground texture is added to the display. The results also suggest that participants change their timing behavior from a strategy based on altitude perception when only a runway outline is present, to one based on TTC perception when texture is added to the display.","",""

IP facilitation skill varied dramatically, suggesting a need for concrete hands-on training in facilitation techniques. All measures of crew participation correlated significantly with IP effectiveness in facilitation. Crews responded to IP guidance but did not lead their own debriefings.

A mathematical analysis was undertaken to assess whether 1 or more of the available texture gradients have the properties required to support this strategy. The analysis revealed that texture gradients in themselves could not be useful. A relative gradient proportionalized against size of texture elements could, however, support descent-path control. Although not mathematically invariant, the departures from invariance of these relative gradients are too small to be functionally significant. In addition, relative gradients are sensitive to minimum functionally significant changes in angle of descent, whereas absolute gradients are not. Thus, relative gradients satisfy the formal requirements of an invariant for control of action.","",""

This leaves little room for learning about how human roles have shifted in automated cockpits or how the distinction between technical and nontechnical skills has become blurred when managing the flight path of an automated aircraft. This article explores how overall pilot training quality, efficiency, and effectiveness would benefit from pulling automation training forward into the pilot training curriculum, reducing the burden carried mainly by transition training today. This article examines various stages of pilot training (including ab initio, multicrew cooperation, and crew resource management training) and lays out the opportunities and obstacles they contain for the integration of flight deck automation. In conclusion, airlines themselves can play a constructive role by specifying what kinds of automation learning requirements earlier pilot training stages should cover, and by sharing their automation philosophies and actively taking part in the design of the preairline training. Such participation from an airline can help achieve appropriate knowledge and attitudes toward automation among its future pilots.","",""

The autonomic components provided increased diagnosticity regarding the autonomic mode of control for heart period change between scenarios and across flight phases. Heart period was shorter (faster heart rate) during the high-than low-workload scenario because of uncoupled sympathetic activation.

The 2 B737-300 models had flight management computers, and the most advanced model, the B737-300e, had electronic flight instrument system displays. Twenty crews were observed during 90 legs of revenue flying. Analyses were conducted on the proportion of time at least 1 pilot looked out of the cockpit. The results showed that the presence of flight management computers affected the amount of time spent looking outside only for landings, with pilots looking out more in the B737-200s than in the B737-300s. The presence of electronic flight instrument system displays did not affect the amount of time pilots spent looking outside.","",""

We focus our discussion on the features of the control system that lead to mode confusion and error. We first provide working definitions of the term mode and discuss key constructs that contribute to mode error, such as mode ambiguity and user expectations. Following this, we discuss human interaction with automated control systems in general and cockpit automation in particular. To provide a formal description of human interaction with such control systems, we introduce a modeling language, Statecharts, which is used by system engineers to specify complex control systems. We use the Statecharts language to describe the 3 types of modes that are commonly found in modern control systems: interface, functional, and supervisory modes. Examples from cockpit automation are used to illustrate each type of mode. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the links between the mode constructs and formal representation of human interaction with control systems.","",""

This is sometimes thought to be an inevitable result of the increased complexity and the need for automation that accompanies the transition to high technology. We argue here that the human performance problems created by glass cockpits are not an inevitable consequence of increased hardware complexity or of automation but, instead, are a result of nonfunctional design that increases complexity at the cockpit interface. The essential danger with computerized interfaces is that many physical design constraints are removed and designers are permitted unheralded opportunities for new information and control formats. Low technology forces the use of functional properties at the interface, but computer technology does not. On the other hand, computer technology does not preclude functional design. Computer technology may offer far broader opportunities for functional design by releasing designers from many physical constraints. In this article, we explain the concept of functional interface design and outline how it might enable the use of high technology and automation in the service of robust and cognitively economical action in an aircraft cockpit.","",""

Seventy-two student pilots and instructors were first administered the Vocabulary, Digit Span, and Digit Symbol subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test, and the near-contrast sensitivity portion of the Vistech VCTS 6000 chart. Participants then spent 11/2 hr at their designated altitude for cognitive testing. Participants performed a 30-min vigilance task while listening to an audiotape with instructions to recall radio calls prefaced by their assigned call sign. Half of the radio calls were high memory loads (at least 4 pieces of information), and half were low memory loads (no more than 2 pieces of information). No effects of altitude were found in performance on the Vigilance task. However, for readbacks of high memory load, significant deficits in recall were observed at 12,500 ft and 15,000 ft, whereas no effect of altitude was observed on recall of readbacks with low memory loads. These results indicate that, at altitude, short-term memory was exceeded for the readbacks requiring a larger amount of information to be recalled, and that cognitive deficits are found at lower altitudes than previously observed.","","adult; aerospace medicine; air quality control; altitude; anoxia; article; atmospheric pressure; attention; cognition; female; human; male; psychologic test; reaction time; short term memory; task performance; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Altitude; Anoxia; Atmosphere Exposure Chambers; Atmospheric Pressure; Attention; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Psychological Tests; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis"

In contrast, midair traffic detection was superior with the head-up display (HUD), reflecting an attentional trade-off. Experiment 2 used the same paradigm in a high-fidelity visual simulation.

The data suggested that attention was modulated between tasks (flight control and detection), and between display areas (head-up and head-down).","","aerospace medicine; aircraft; analysis of variance; article; attention; aviation; bioengineering; computer graphics; computer interface; computer simulation; human; information processing; instrumentation; reaction time; task performance; Aerospace Medicine; Aircraft; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Aviation; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Data Display; Human Engineering; Humans; Reaction Time; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface"

One hundred eighty-eight international pilots responded to a questionnaire that assessed overall fatigue and the symptoms pilots associated with fatigue on duty. The questionnaire also assessed the methods used by pilots to cope with fatigue before a duty as well as on the flight deck. Analysis showed that these symptoms could be grouped into five factors: sleepiness, cognitive dysfunction, emotional disturbance, boredom, and physical effects. Pilots reporting high levels of overall fatigue differed from other pilots in terms of noticing symptoms related to cognitive difficulties and emotional disturbance. The most common coping strategies used prior to a duty involved napping and conserving energy. Coping strategies used by pilots on the flight deck could be grouped into five factors: planning energy use, active coping, mental withdrawal, communicating with other crew, and coffee drinking. In their coping strategies during flights, high-fatigue pilots differed from other crew in their higher use of energy planning. The study suggests that pilots reporting high levels of fatigue may use different sensations to monitor when they are tired. Modifying some of the less functional coping strategies used by high-fatigue pilots may be a useful point of intervention to reduce fatigue.","",""

To address this issue, this study utilized 3 conceptual models of information processing and human error to reorganize the human factors database associated with U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviation accidents between 1977-1992. All 3 taxonomies were able to accommodate well over three quarters of the pilot-causal factors contained in the database. Examinations of the recoded data revealed that procedural and response-execution errors were most common, followed by errors in judgment. However, judgment errors were more frequently associated with major than with minor accidents. Minor accidents, on the other hand, were associated more with procedural errors than were major accidents. This investigation demonstrates that existing postaccident databases can be reorganized using conceptual human-error frameworks, which may allow for previously unforeseen trends to be identified.","",""

In earlier work, Loomis and Beall (1992) proposed a rule for turning an aircraft into alignment: Turn the aircraft in such a way as to hold constant the rate of change of splay (the angle the projected runway makes with respect to the vertical). The experiment presented in this article was a psychophysical test of this rule. We compared day and night landing approaches as our experimental manipulation; we were interested in any role that ground texture might play in the spatial judgment involved in performing the landing approach. Three pilots varying in flight experience performed multiple approaches in a light aircraft for a total of 26 day and 25 night approaches. The three-dimensional trajectories of the aircraft were measured using differential global positioning system data. From these trajectories we computed a variety of motion variables (e.g., turn rate) and two optic flow variables (splay and splay rate). The similar performance of day and night approaches suggests that the pilots were using optic flow variables that were invariant with changes in the visibility of ground texture. A computer model was developed based on the optic flow rule and estimates of human visual processing thresholds. We conclude that the model gives a good description of pilot performance as tested in our experiment and may help to illuminate the cause of a class of airplane accidents during the common landing phase.","",""

Results showed that the two Western cultures share 56% common variance in their perceptions of stressfulness, but this changes to 35% between the New Zealand and Singapore groups and only 21% between Canada and Singapore. Although comparison of the factor structure of the stress ratings of the Singapore and New Zealand samples again confirmed a general pattern of underlying stressors related to air traffic control (which fits general occupational models of stress), it also revealed culturally specific components. The nature of these suggests that they are embedded in the context of Asian environments and cultures. The conclusion is that stress in Air Traffic Controllers is related both to generic occupation stressors and to others that are both organizationally and culturally specific.","","adult; aerospace medicine; article; aviation; Canada; comparative study; cultural anthropology; female; human; human relation; male; mental stress; New Zealand; occupational health; organization; organization and management; questionnaire; Singapore; workload; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Aviation; Cultural Diversity; Culture; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Occupational Health; Organizational Culture; Questionnaires; Stress, Psychological; Workload"

The model showed a direct influence of general cognitive ability (g) on the acquisition of job knowledge and an indirect influence on the acquisition of flying skills. The direct and indirect influence of cognitive ability on flying skills was a little stronger for women than for men. Additionally, the path between prior job knowledge (JK<inf>p</inf>) and flying performance was somewhat stronger for women than for men.

They must make sure that tasks are started arid stopped at the right times and that undue attention to lower priority tasks does pot prevent the correct and timely completion of higher priority tasks. Just as failure to perform tasks correctly can lead to accidents, failure to manage tasks correctly can have catastrophic consequences as well.

Participants' critical tracking ability was also assessed using a central attitude display. Recognition deteriorated with eccentricity, and a wide distribution of recognition and tracking abilities was found. Experiment 2 combined the tasks; recognition was designated the primary task. Dual-task measures included the change in recognition accuracy and the increase in tracking error. Individuals' recognition thresholds (Experiment 1) failed to predict their dual-task tracking performance (Experiment 2). Notably, viewers' critical tracking ability predicted their success in preserving dual-task aircraft recognition.

Four seminal issues that threaten the interpretation of the results of ability studies are introduced and examined. A brief history of the use of g in pilot selection is presented, going back to the World War I era. At that time, many countries used tests such as perception and reaction time, later shown to be mostly measures of g. The World War II era brought the age of the multiple aptitude batteries, and with it, the theory of differential abilities. However, most militaries still used highly g-saturated measures. More recently, an awareness of the prominence of g in job performance has led to a series of studies that showed the central role of g in predicting pilot success. In comparative analyses, g was found to be a better predictor of pilot criteria than specific abilities. However, some specific abilities or measures of job knowledge were found to increment the predictiveness of g. Several selection variables that appeared to measure characteristics other than g were found to measure, at least in some part, g. These include psychomotor tests and structured interviews. Finally, speculation on the future of the measurement of g is presented.","","aerospace medicine; article; cognition; human; intelligence test; methodology; personnel management; prediction and forecasting; psychologic test; psychological aspect; psychology; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; sample size; soldier; Aerospace Medicine; Cognition; Humans; Intelligence Tests; Military Personnel; Personnel Selection; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychological Tests; Psychology, Military; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Sample Size"

It is first suggested that the entire domain is characterized by terminological and methodological confusion. The economic and other benefits of psychological testing are contrasted with the potential risks, including abuse and the use of tests in circumstances for which they were never designed.

Automated versions of vintage psychomotor tests (developed in the 1930s and 1940s) seem to be as predictive of military pilot/aviator performance today as in the past. The psychomotor tests receiving the most attention today are the Complex Coordination and Two-Hand Coordination tests originally developed by Mashburn and colleges before World War II (Mashburn, 1934). These tests were significant predictors of Air Force and Navy pass-fail criteria in the past, and automated versions are similarly predictive today. The U.S. Army and Air Force are now using a combination of paper-and-pencil and automated psychomotor-cognitive tests for initial selection (Air Force) or helicopter assignment (Army). It appears that the Navy is considering the use of automated cognitive and psychomotor tests in a selection battery of the future.","","aerospace medicine; automation; aviation; education; history; human; personnel management; prediction and forecasting; psychologic test; psychological aspect; psychomotor performance; review; soldier; standard; statistics; task performance; United States; Aerospace Medicine; Automation; Aviation; History, 20th Century; Humans; Military Personnel; Personnel Selection; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Task Performance and Analysis"

During selection, 274 pilots applying for employment with a European charter airline were examined with a multidimensional personality questionnaire (Temperament Structure Scales; TSS). Additionally, the applicants were graded in a simulator checkflight. On the basis of training records, the pilots were classified as performing either at standard or below standard after about 3 years of employment in the hiring company. In a multiple-regression model, this dichotomous criterion for job success can be predicted with 73.8% accuracy through the simulator checkflight and flying experience prior to employment. By adding the personality questionnaire to the regression equation, the number of correct classifications increases to 79.3%. On average, successful pilots score substantially higher on interpersonal scales and lower on emotional scales of the TSS.","","adult; aerospace medicine; aircraft; article; aviation; comparative study; computer simulation; female; human; instrumentation; male; model; personality; personality test; personnel management; prediction and forecasting; questionnaire; task performance; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Aircraft; Aviation; Comparative Study; Computer Simulation; Female; Human; Male; Middle Age; Models, Psychological; Personality; Personality Assessment; Personality Tests; Personnel Selection; Predictive Value of Tests; Questionnaires; Task Performance and Analysis"

The noise featured a Dopplerlike quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d‘) was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a “floor effect” rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload. The results provide the initial experimental demonstration that perceived workload is a sensitive measure of the effects of aircraft noise in monitoring tasks. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This model proposes that autonomic nervous system influences on the heart may change with psychological processing in ways that are not evident in heart rate. A method of mental-workload assessment was proposed that used multiple psychophysiological measures of cardiovascular responsivity to derive the underlying sympathetic and parasympathetic information needed to represent the autonomic space for heart rate. Principal-components analysis was used to extract Sympathetic and Parasympathetic components from heart period, residual heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and Traube-HeringMayer wave in three experiments that manipulated perceptual/central processing and physical task demands. This initial evaluation of the method concluded that the autonomic components were valid and that the components had greater diagnosticity, and for some manipulations greater sensitivity, than heart rate. These results support the contention that the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic components provided increased precision for mental-workload assessment. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Sixteen subjects flew a low-fidelity flight simulation. Subjects were required to perform a two-axis tracking task, a concurrent visual-monitoring task, and a discrete decision task. The decision task had 16 variations defined by two levels on each of the following dimensions: input modality (visual vs. auditory), processing code (spatial vs. verbal), difficulty (easy vs. hard), and response modality (manual vs. voice). Dual-task costs were found only for the tracking task. The tracking data were then analyzed using two approaches: a traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a correlational analysis of tracking performance versus model predictions. The ANOVA revealed that performance on the tracking task was better when the concurrent decision task was responded to vocally and was easy. Input modality and processing code of the concurrent decision task had no significant effect on tracking performance. The correlational analysis was used to evaluate each of the three models, to determine what features were responsible for improving the models’ fit, and to compare their performance with a pure time-line model that makes no multiple-resource assumptions. All three models did a good job of predicting variance between experimental conditions, accounting for between 56% and 84% of the variance in our data and between 10% and 40% of an earlier data set. Different features of each model that affect the fit are then discussed. We conclude that it is important for models to retain a multiple-resource coding, although the best features of that coding remain to be determined. Coding tasks by their demand level appears to be less critical. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The first experiment considered how the manipulation of prior level of task demand affected subsequent workload and performance. The second experiment examined the effects on performance and workload of increments in the level of task demand. Results from the first study indicated that prior level of imposed task difficulty did affect response in a manner consistent with a scaling of workload in relation to previous task conditions. The second study demonstrated the primacy of absolute demand level over increments in that demand as influencing operator response. Overall, our results indicate that workload and performance are sensitive to multiple characteristics of the task and not instantaneous demand level alone. These findings are important in explaining why association and dissociation occur between task demand, operator efficiency, and perceived workload in differing performance contexts. The importance of these findings for the aviation psychologist in assessing pilot and operator workload is articulated. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Over the course of the flight, pilots flew along specified routes while scheduling and performing several flight-related secondary tasks. The first phase of flight was flown under low-workload conditions, whereas the second phase of flight was flown under high-workload conditions in the form of increased turbulence and a disorganized instrument layout. Six pilots were randomly assigned to each of three workload preview groups. Subjects in the no-preview group were not given preview of the increased-workload conditions. Subjects in the declarative preview group were verbally informed of the nature of the flight workload manipulation but did not receive any practice under the high-workload conditions. Subjects in the procedural preview group received the same instructions as the declarative preview group but also flew half of the practice flight under the high-workload conditions. The results show that workload preview fostered efficient scheduling strategies. Specifically, those pilots with either declarative or procedural preview of future workload demands adopted an efficient strategy of scheduling more of the difficult secondary tasks during the low-workload phase of flight. However, those pilots given a procedural preview showed the greatest benefits in overall flight performance. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This claim is inconsistent with many of the mainstream approaches to education and cognition. I describe what it means to be situated, and I outline the central issues raised in the literature on situated cognition and situated learning. The ideas outlined here have several implications for the conduct of flight instruction. The most pervasive implications are that current and potential training practices in aviation can create a breach between instruction and practice and can lead to the development of inert skills. A recurrent theme for situated cognition is that there is a self-organizing character to learning. If adequately supported by the design of the workspace and the structure of the training program, this self-organizing character of learning will limit the possibility of a breach between instruction and practice and will ensure development of robust skills. A further implication of the research reviewed here is that the role of aviation specialists in the design of systems and training programs has been too limited for it to be fully effective. I introduce the procedure of participatory design as an alternative approach that may ensure the effectiveness of flight training. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.","",""

This increase in the degrees of freedom in design has shifted questions away from narrow technological feasibility. Many concerned groups, from designers and operators to regulators and researchers, have begun to ask questions about how we should use the possibilities afforded by technology skillfully to support and expand human performance. In this article, we report on an experimental study that addressed these questions by examining pilot interaction with the current generation of flight deck automation. Previous results on pilot-automation interaction derived from pilot surveys, incident reports, and training observations have produced a corpus of features and contexts in which human-machine coordination is likely to break down (e.g., automation surprises). We used these data to design a simulated flight scenario that contained a variety of probes designed to reveal pilots’ mental model of one major component of flight deck automation: the Flight Management System (FMS). The events within the scenario were also designed to probe pilots’ ability to apply their knowledge and understanding in specific flight contexts and to examine their ability to track the status and behavior of the automated system (mode awareness). Although pilots were able to “make the system work” in standard situations, the results reveal a variety of latent problems in pilot-FMS interaction that can affect pilot performance in nonnormal time critical situations. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Direct (verbal reports) and indirect (multidimensional scaling) procedures were used to identify potential factors. A list of candidate factors was created by combining the data from the direct and indirect knowledge exploration methods. Important complexity factors were identified by determining their simple and multiple correlations with overall sector complexity as judged by a group of Traffic Management Unit personnel (flow controllers). A final list of 16 complexity factors was developed and is suggested as a reference for future research in the area. An evaluation of the knowledge extraction techniques indicated that, although little unique information was generated by the indirect procedure, it was useful for the identification of complexity factors when combined with data from direct sources. Further research to validate the identified sector complexity factors is recommended. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.","",""

The role of the FPS has recently attracted attention because of plans to automate this aspect of air traffic control (ATC). The communication and FPS activities of controllers were classified as they controlled air traffic of varying complexity. Transition networks were derived from the empirical transitions. These networks indicated that several aspects of ATC generalize across complexity including the centrality of writing on the FPSs and the control of traffic. Complexity affected when FPSs were used with high-complexity traffic situations that required the controller to devote uninterrupted periods of time to the management of the FPSs rather than integrate these board management responsibilities with the responsibilities of separating aircraft. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Research using inexpensive, tabletop computer-based simulations as CRM training media was conducted with military aircrews.

For four 30-min sessions, 40 subjects performed an IBM PC-based flight simulation that included manual tracking and fuel-management tasks, as well as a system-monitoring task that was under automation control. Automation reliability'the percentage of system malfunctions detected by the automation routine'either remained constant at a low or high level over time or alternated every 10 min from low to high. Operator detection of automation failures was substantially worse for constant-reliability than for variable-reliability automation after about 20 min under automation control, indicating that the former condition induced “complacency”. When system monitoring was the only task, detection was very efficient and was unaffected by variations in automation reliability. The results provide the first empirical evidence of the performance consequences of automation-induced “complacency”. We relate findings to operator attitudes toward automation and discuss implications for cockpit automation design. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.","",""

Transfer was assessed in the simulator with a moderate-detail pictorial scene, no visual augmentation, and a normal roll response. Training with visual augmentation was superior to training without it, although a Scene Detail x Visual Augmentation interaction revealed that the nonpredictive guidance augmentation enhanced transfer only when it was combined in training with the low-detail scene.

However, little is known about the nature and causes of problems that arise in pilot-automation interaction. In this article, we report the results of two studies that provide converging, complementary data on pilots’ difficulties with understanding and operating one of the core systems of cockpit automation, the Flight Management System (FMS). As vehicles to gather a corpus on the nature and variety of FMS-related problems, we used a survey asking pilots to describe specific incidents with the FMS, and we used the observations of pilots undergoing transition training to a glass cockpit aircraft. The results of both studies indicate that pilots become proficient in standard FMS operations through ground training and subsequent line experience. But even with considerable line experience, they still have difficulties tracking FMS status and behavior in certain flight contexts, and they show gaps in their understanding of the functional structure of the system. The results suggest that design-related factors such as opaque interfaces contribute to these difficulties, which can affect pilots’ situation awareness. The results of this research are relevant for both the design of cockpit automation and the development of training curricula specifically tailored to the needs of glass cockpits. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Before the main analyses, the extreme skewness of the DLT and PMT error measures was corrected by log transformations, and between-squadrons differences in flight grades were removed by transformations based on z scores. Primary flight grades were highly correlated with the psychomotor scores (rs = -.26 to -.41) and moderately correlated with the dichotic listening scores (rs = -.22 to -.28). These rs were significant at an experiment-wise alpha of. 05. Multiple regression analysis indicated an even stronger validity coefficient when a combination of the performance measures was used (R =. 442).

A weighted composite of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) flying performance data (i.e., daily flying grades, check flight grades, and academic grades) was shown to be related closely to advanced training recommendations (fighter vs. nonfighter aircraft). This suggested that this composite score was a reasonable measure of pilot candidate quality because fighter aircraft assignments are considered more prestigious and demanding than nonfighter assignments. When the weighted composite algorithm was modified to include UPT eliminees, however, it demonstrated little utility in adding to our understanding of the relation between performance on selection instruments (i.e., test scores) and training performance (i.e., had little impact on the rankings of the applicants).

The two visual-spatial tasks were time-shared to investigate the possibility of a compatibility mapping between the task type and task location. The attentional costs associated with time-sharing visual-spatial tasks were also addressed. The results show that (a) the ecological display allowed for the most efficient time-sharing, suggesting further investigation into the use of nontraditional flight displays for the reduction of central visual overload in the cockpit; (b) the type of task determined how quickly it was performed while the location determined how accurately it was performed; and (c) two peripheral tasks were found to interfere more than one central and one peripheral task, or two central tasks.

But one person, the NASA manager who gave final approval for the Challenger launch, especially has to feel a sense of grief and responsibility. Caught between the pressure to satisfy politicians, the American people, NASA's launch schedule, and a complicated array of possible system failures, he made a decision that proved fatal. On a much more routine but no less lethal scale, most aviation operations managers are caught between the pressure to run an efficient, lean, and responsive operation and the ever-present possibility that an overlooked or underestimated “O-ring” will fail. In the aviation business, the human element is the weak link or “O-ring” more often than not. As the NASA manager knows only too well, no matter who is the pilot-incommand, the manager who selects the pilot; sets crew standards and duty cycles; and establishes company weather minimums and other operating standards is ultimately responsible for operational safety. This article is intended to provide an easy reference to the operating pitfalls, the human frailties, and the risks associated with managing flight operations. Helicopter air-ambulance operators are used to illustrate specific problems and provide extreme examples. The analysis identifies the inherent risks based on the latest National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident data (NTSB, 1988) and describes techniques that can be used to balance the demands of running a business with the need for maintaining safety.

Although a significant problem, design specifications for alleviation of simulator sickness have not yet been produced. The problems researchers face in this area are multiple: (a) Simulator sickness is polygenic, rendering experimental isolation of variables ineffective; (b) simulator sickness is polysymptomatic, which must be reflected in measurements of the human response; and (c) there are statistical limitations including limited sample sizes, adaptation over flights, small effect sizes, and large individual differences. These problems render certain research and engineering strategies more effective than others.

Interest centered on different frame-of-reference representations. The north-up map emphasized consistency of object location, characteristic of an earth-centered frame of reference. The track-up map emphasized map-terrain congruency, characteristic of an ego-centered frame of reference. Twenty skilled pilots used the maps to complete several navigational tasks that occurred within a realistic simulation program tailored for helicopter navigation. Findings revealed an interesting pattern of map-task dependencies.

The research reported here was a preliminary investigation of the effects of factors that might induce biased landing approaches in a simulator and of a procedure for calibrating a simulator to eliminate biases.

However, the proper criterion is the flight hours saved in airborne training for each incremental investment in ground training. Furthermore, research has shown that innovations in training strategies, in some cases involving intentional departures from reality, can have stronger effects than high simulator fidelity on the resulting quality of pilot performance. Ideally, each aspect of the training curriculum could be taught to some criterion performance level on the ground.

The flight scenario was designed to be as realistic as possible but consisted of a task which included abnormal operations and required the coordinated efforts of all crew members. It was found that the best performing crews were characterized by nearly identical patterns of communication, whereas the midrange and poorer performing crews showed a great deal of heterogeneity in their speech patterns. Although some specific speech sequences can be interpreted as being more or less facilitative to the crew coordination process, predictability appears to be the key ingredient for enhancing crew performance.

An overview is given regarding the design and theoretical background of the project Psychological, physiological, and observational data were collected before, during, and after flight. In our theoretical model, stress and strain in flight result from concrete actions by specific pilots in specific objectively definable situations. Traits, such as anxiety, riskiness, and aggressiveness, are regarded as manifestations of behavior regulation styles, which appear during flight. These traits and behavior regulation patterns are determined by cognitive processes, especially the pilots perception of himself and the situation. By identifying those characteristics of the person and the environment that (in an interaction) lead to critical flight situations and stress, it is possible to deduce weak points and give recommendations in the domain of flight security. As examples for concrete interactions between personality and situational variables, the observed stress of helicopter crews, which depends on the personality characteristics of riskiness and test anxiety (worry cognitions), and situation-characteristic difficulty are introduced. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

The second study was used to examine the hypothesis that the superior performance obtained with polar formats was not merely a function of reductions in visual scanning requirements but stemmed from the organization and symmetry found in the iconic display.

The quality of flight instructor training also varies greatly because there is no standardized syllabus for the instructor course. Both flight instructors and inspectors felt that flight instructor training should provide competency in teaching methods and a more thorough understanding of learning and evaluation theories. They also stressed the need for senior instructors who teach the flight instructor course to receive additional training before they are authorized to teach others how to teach because the quality of flight training rests with them. Flight instructors conveyed strong feelings about the methods used by Transport Canada to evaluate their teaching effectiveness. The main objections concerned the use of role playing as a means of assessing the teaching ability of flight instructors and the use of a flight test record to hold flight instructors accountable for the success or failure of their students.

An interest in the acquisition of piloting skills has led a number of researchers to question the relative transfer of simulated instrument training to instrument and contact flight. In this study, we examined the transfer of simulated instrument training from Device 2F101, the operational flight trainer for the T-2C aircraft, to actual instrument and contact flight for level speed change and standard-rate turn maneuvers. Trainees were randomly assigned to one of three training levels (two, four, or eight simulator flights) and to one of two aircraft flight conditions following training (contact or basic instruments) in a counterbalanced sequence. Altitude, air speed, and heading errors in deviations from controlled flight were recorded as measures of training effectiveness. The most notable finding indicates significant and equal transfer of instrument training to contact and instrument flight for the maneuvers selected. Other findings indicate differential learning rates for the two maneuvers but also indicate equal final performance on each maneuver for both types of flight.
