2019,Third-culture kid pilots and multi-cultural identity efects on pilots' attitudes,"<title>Third-culture kid pilots and multi-cultural identity efects on pilots' attitudes</title> <excerpt>IP: 103.3.231.66 On: Thu, 09 Jan 2020 04:17:02 Copyright: Aerospace Medical Association BACKGROUND: Current attempts to culturally tailor human factors training in aviation segregates cultural identities based on geopoliti- cal, passport nationality, and is therefore poorly suited for (adult) 'Third Culture Kids' (TCKs) whose cross-cultural upbringing has led to the development of multicultural individual identities that do not relect their passport nationali- ties. In this study, respondents' self-categorization of personal cultural identity, as opposed to passport nationality, was used to determine whether there were cultural diferences in airline pilots' behaviors. METHOD: A survey with items imported from established scales was distributed to pilots of an international airline to measure pilots' work values, light management attitudes, and cultural dimensions, with respondents segregated into Western, TCK, or Asian cultural groups.</excerpt>",-1

2019,Family influence mediates the relation between helicopter-parenting and millennial work attitudes,"<title>Family influence mediates the relation between helicopter-parenting and millennial work attitudes</title> <excerpt>PurposeDrawing from life course theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of family influence on career development (FICD) on the relationship of helicopter-parenting (over-parenting behavior) and US millennials’ work attitudes.Design/methodology/approachIn Study 1 (n=268), confirmatory factor analysis was tested on all scales to derive fit models. Mediation analyses using PROCESS (Preacher and Hayes, 2004) were conducted on Study 1 and Study 2 (n=196) on survey collected data sets.FindingsCapturing life course theorists’ proposition that parental involvement now extends itself through childhood and into millennials’ adulthood, results from both studies indicate helicopter-parenting is related to FICD. Further, for both studies, information support (FICD factor) positively mediates the relationship between helicopter-parenting and, affective commitment and job satisfaction, and negatively mediates the relationship between helicopter-parenting and turnover intentions.</excerpt>",19

2016,Psychophysiological sensing and state classification for attention management in commercial aviation,"<title>Psychophysiological sensing and state classification for attention management in commercial aviation</title> <excerpt>Attention-related human performance limiting states (AHPLS) can cause pilots to lose airplane state awareness (ASA), and their detection is important to improving commercial aviation safety. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team found that the majority of recent international commercial aviation accidents attributable to loss of control inflight involved flight crew loss of airplane state awareness, and that distraction of various forms was involved in all of them. Research on AHPLS, including channelized attention, diverted attention, startle/surprise, and confirmation bias, has been recommended in a Safety Enhancement (SE) entitled “Training for Attention Management.” To accomplish the detection of such cognitive and psychophysiological states, a broad suite of sensors has been implemented to simultaneously measure their physiological markers during high fidelity flight simulation human subject studies.</excerpt>",0

The FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) guide for AME's (aviation medical examiners) includes specific requirements with regard to the psychiatric assessment and medical exclusions for mental health problems and these are very similar to the criteria stipulated by most other regulatory authorities worldwide. Severe psychological disturbance among pilots is rare but just as in other occupational groups, they may, however, suffer from a range of psychological difficulties which may be mild to moderate in severity and in most cases be transient and treatable (Bor and Hubbard, 2006; Bor et al, 2002; Elliot, 2013).</excerpt>",40

2016,Designs and Algorithms to Map Eye Tracking Data with Dynamic Multielement Moving Objects,"<title>Designs and Algorithms to Map Eye Tracking Data with Dynamic Multielement Moving Objects</title> <excerpt>Design concepts and algorithms were developed to address the eye tracking analysis issues that arise when (1) participants interrogate dynamic multielement objects that can overlap on the display and (2) visual angle error of the eye trackers is incapable of providing exact eye fixation coordinates. These issues were addressed by (1) developing dynamic areas of interests (AOIs) in the form of either convex or rectangular shapes to represent the moving and shape-changing multielement objects, (2) introducing the concept of AOI gap tolerance (AGT) that controls the size of the AOIs to address the overlapping and visual angle error issues, and (3) finding a near optimal AGT value. The approach was tested in the context of air traffic control (ATC) operations where air traffic controller specialists (ATCSs) interrogated multiple moving aircraft on a radar display to detect and control the aircraft for the purpose of maintaining safe and expeditious air transportation.</excerpt>",5

2015,How Prevalent Are Hazardous Attitudes Among Orthopaedic Surgeons?,"<title>How Prevalent Are Hazardous Attitudes Among Orthopaedic Surgeons?</title> <excerpt>Background: So-called “hazardous attitudes” (macho, impulsive, antiauthority, resignation, invulnerable, and confident) were identified by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Canadian Air Transport Administration as contributing to road traffic incidents among college-aged drivers and felt to be useful for the prevention of aviation accidents. The concept of hazardous attitudes may also be useful in understanding adverse events in surgery, but it has not been widely studied. Questions/purposes: We surveyed a cohort of orthopaedic surgeons to determine the following: (1) What is the prevalence of hazardous attitudes in a large cohort of orthopaedic surgeons? (2) Do practice setting and/or demographics influence variation in hazardous attitudes in our cohort of surgeons? (3) Do surgeons feel they work in a climate that promotes patient safety? Methods: We asked the members of the Science of Variation Group—fully trained, practicing orthopaedic and trauma surgeons from around the world—to complete a questionnaire validated in college-aged drivers measuring six attitudes associated with a greater likelihood of collision and used by pilots to assess and teach aviation safety.</excerpt>",-1

2015,The Effectiveness of Behavior-Based Safety in the Flight Training Environment,"<title>The Effectiveness of Behavior-Based Safety in the Flight Training Environment</title> <excerpt>Although flight training accounts for an eighth of the total flying in general aviation, nearly one-third of midair collisions occur during instructional flights. Initiating clearing turns prior to training maneuvers is an important means of preventing a midair collision. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine (a) Which human factors are causing the discrepancies between procedures and practice with respect to clearing turns, and are those discrepancies reduced through the implementation of behavior-based safety (BBS)? and (b) Is there a significant increase in the utilization of clearing turns prior to the initiation of training maneuvers by students in the flight program after BBS implementation? The participants in this study were college students and instructors in a 4-year professional pilot program operated under Part 141 regulations.</excerpt>",-1

2015,From trees to forest: relational complexity network and workload of air traffic controllers,"<title>From trees to forest: relational complexity network and workload of air traffic controllers</title> <excerpt>In this paper, we propose a relational complexity (RC) network framework based on RC metric and network theory to model controllers' workload in conflict detection and resolution. We suggest that, at the sector level, air traffic showing a centralised network pattern can provide cognitive benefits in visual search and resolution decision which will in turn result in lower workload. We found that the network centralisation index can account for more variance in predicting perceived workload and task completion time in both a static conflict detection task (Study 1) and a dynamic one (Study 2) in addition to other aircraft-level and pair-level factors.</excerpt>",8

Background: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (eg, alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking.</excerpt>",44

A review of different crew-automation conflicting scenarios shows that they have a common denominator: the autopilot behaviour interferes with the pilot's goal regarding the flight guidance via 'hidden' mode transitions. Considering both the human operator and the machine (ie the autopilot or the decision functions) as agents, we propose a Petri net model of those conflicting interactions, which allows them to be detected as deadlocks in the Petri net.</excerpt>",-1

2014,The evolution and the latest developments of Chinese conflicts law for torts,"<title>The evolution and the latest developments of Chinese conflicts law for torts</title> <excerpt>The legislation of choice-of-law rules for torts has a long history in China. General Principles of the Civil Law of the People’s Republic of China of 1986 (GPCL), Maritime Act of the People’s Republic of China of 1992 (Maritime Act) and Act of the People’s Republic of China on Civil Aviation of 1995 (Civil Aviation Act) provide respectively the choice-of-law rules for general tort, maritime tort and limitation of liability for maritime claims as well as tort arising out of civil aircraft. The Act of the People’s Republic of China on the Application of Laws in Foreign-Related Civil Relations of 2010 (PIL-Act) not only brings developments and changes to conflict rules for tort in general, but also provide choice-of-law rules for product liability, infringement of the right of personality via the internet and liability arising from an infringement of intellectual property rights, which marks that Chinese conflicts law has entered into a new developmental stage and taken on several new trends: (1) Chinese conflicts law system for torts has been basically set up; (2) Chinese choice-of-law rules for torts are becoming more and more diversified; (3) the principle of party autonomy has been fully introduced to tort liability; and (4) judicial interpretations issued or to be issued by the Supreme People’s Court will still play an important role in judicial practice.</excerpt>",-1

It was hypothesized that intentional response distortion would either increase towards the end of a long questionnaire, as learning effects might make it easier to adjust responses to a faking good schema, or decrease because applicants' will to distort responses is reduced if the questionnaire lasts long enough. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that certain types of questionnaire content are especially vulnerable to response distortion.</excerpt>",80
2014,The psychologist and the bombardier: The Army Air Forces' aircrew classification program in WWII,"<title>The psychologist and the bombardier: The Army Air Forces' aircrew classification program in WWII</title> <excerpt>During World War II, psychologists in the Army Air Forces were given an unprecedented opportunity to showcase their discipline by developing examinations to test the aptitude of aviation cadets as pilots, navigators, or bombardiers. These psychologists enjoyed success in classifying pilots and navigators, but became quickly frustrated by their results for bombardiers. The trouble lay not in their choice of tests but in their performance measures for bombardiering, a difficulty that came to be known as 'the problem of the criterion.' This episode in the history of military mental testing exemplifies the challenges faced by psychologists at the moment they were poised to gain the support of the armed services, and highlights how these new hazards shaped postwar military psychology.</excerpt>",25

Distance is a particularly important factor because, as the average distance of individual trips grows, there is an increase in the collective environmental impact of annual emissions. The magnitude of anticipated increases in global air travel is demonstrated by a recent report from Boeing that forecasts that the total demand for passenger jet aircraft is likely to grow from 20,000 aircraft in 2010 to 40,000 in 2030 (Boeing, 2013).</excerpt>",83

Tasked by the US Armed Services to identify men with the requisite traits, experimental and applied psychologists developed rigorous methods for screening and training personnel, as well as techniques for evaluating the design of equipment for its ease of use. These military-minded psychologists elaborated a new technocratic discourse—a set of assumptions, concepts, and techniques for producing scientific knowledge about human proficiency in operating technological systems—which promised that even the most complex networks of humans and machines could be calibrated to work seamlessly together to achieve unrivaled capabilities.</excerpt>",25

2014,Why sustainable transport policies will fail: EU climate policy in the light of transport taboos,"<title>Why sustainable transport policies will fail: EU climate policy in the light of transport taboos</title> <excerpt>There is widespread consensus that current climate policy for passenger transportation is insufficient to achieve significant emission reductions in line with global climate stabilization goals. This article consequently has a starting point in the notion of 'path dependency' (Schwanen et al, 2011) and an observed 'implementation gap' (Banister and Hickman, 2013), suggesting that significant mitigation policies for transport do not emerge in the European Union because of various interlinked 'transport taboos', ie barriers to the design, acceptance and implementation of such transport policies that remain unaddressed as they constitute political risk. The paper argues that without addressing transport taboos, such as highly unequal individual contributions to transport volumes and emissions, social inequality of planned market-based measures, the role of lobbyism, and the various social and psychological functions of mobility, it will remain difficult to achieve significant emission reductions in passenger transport.</excerpt>",64

In complex safety critical human integrated systems, loss of control or automation surprises often trace their origin to disparities between the human agent’s mental representation of a system and the actual states/dynamics of the system and its environment. In addition to the physical state of the environment, operators now have to extend their awareness to the state of the automation itself which supposes an active monitoring action.</excerpt>",-1

Large, transport category aircraft are equipped with flight data monitoring (FDM) as a secondary data source that can help pilots determine if a hard landing occurred, but FDM is not commonplace in general aviation. It is important for a pilot to be able to differentiate between a firm landing that does not cause damage to the aircraft and hard landing that potentially could cause damage to the aircraft by means of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive cues.</excerpt>",45

However, to date we have a limited understanding of how sleep and HEA interact.</excerpt>",1
2012,Local Theories versus Comprehensive Architectures: The Cognitive Science Jigsaw Puzzle,"<title>Local Theories versus Comprehensive Architectures: The Cognitive Science Jigsaw Puzzle</title> <excerpt>Reasons for considering integrated models of cognitive systems as a desideratum are myriad, ranging from deeply theoretical interest in the structure of cognition for its own sake to the desire to gain leverage on difficult applied problems to pedagogical interests in blending cognitive psychology with related disciplines like artificial intelligence. What is remarkable is how much progress has been made by human factors researchers and practitioners in domains like commercial aviation despite the profound lack of a good integrated theory of perception, cognition, and motor control. The notion of everything fitting together raises what is known as ""the jigsaw puzzle problem."" The analogy here is that the whole cognitive science endeavor has as one of its goals the construction of a complete and detailed picture of human cognition and performance (which would nicely support the interactive behavior triad).</excerpt>",52
2012,Team task analysis: Differentiating between tasks using team relatedness and team workflow as metrics of team task interdependence,"<title>Team task analysis: Differentiating between tasks using team relatedness and team workflow as metrics of team task interdependence</title> <excerpt>Objective: As a constructive replication and extension of Arthur, Edwards, Bell, Villado, and Bennett (2005), the objective of the current study was to further investigate the efficacy of team relatedness and team workflow ratings (along with their composite) as metrics of interdependence.Background: Although an analysis of task and job interdependence has important implications and uses in domains such as job design, selection, and training, the job analysis literature has been slow to develop an effective method to identify team-based tasks and jobs.Method: To achieve the study's objectives, 140 F-16 fighter pilots (35 four-person teams) rated 34 task and activity statements in terms of their team relatedness and team workflow.Results: The results indicated that team relatedness and team workflow effectively differentiated between tasks with varying levels of interdependency (as identified by instructor pilots who served as subject matter experts) within the same job. In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well. © 2012 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society..</excerpt>",49

That is, the meaning is not inherent to the relationship between words, signs and symbols that arise from negotiating a necessary and unavoidable. As the concepts of sense as discrete and static representations imply a notion of classical computing and design of a cognitive system corresponding conceptions of meaning construction as located and shared among agents implies notions of different computing and cognition.</excerpt>",52
2012,Could mild hypoxia impair pilot decision making in emergencies?,"<title>Could mild hypoxia impair pilot decision making in emergencies?</title> <excerpt>The decreased pressure in the cabin of a pressurised aircraft (typically equivalent to ~8000 ft) reduces the oxygen level so that the blood oxygen saturation of all occupants falls from >97% (normoxia) at sea-level to below 92% (mild hypoxia). Although exposure to mild hypoxia does not affect well-learned cognitive and motor performance of aircrew, it has been proposed that it can affect the performance of some complex cognitive performance tasks involving multiple demands typical of emergency tasks that may have to be performed by pilots. In order to simulate some of these complex cognitive demands, 25 student volunteers participated in an experiment which assessed performance of complex logical reasoning and and multiple memory tasks before and after 2 hours of exposure to normoxia and mild hypoxia.</excerpt>",20

It observes that the FAA delegate a large amount of this work to the manufacturers themselves, and discusses why they do this by invoking arguments from the sociology of science and technology. It suggests that - contrary to popular portrayal - regulators of high technologies face an inevitable epistemic barrier when making technological assessments, which forces them to delegate technical questions to people with more tacit knowledge, and hence to 'regulate' at a distance by evaluating 'trust' rather than 'technology'.</excerpt>",76

What makes ST-PRA an evolutionary step is that the entire risk model is made up of human errors and at-risk behaviors, attempting to model the as-is state of a predominantly human process. Where traditional PRA will generally model a technical system with some input of human errors (eg, THERP or WASH 1400; Kanki & Marx, 2004), the ST-PRA attempts to model human errors and human variations, where, given behavioral norms, 1 task can be performed many different ways within 1 risk model.</excerpt>",-1

The putative mechanism for this increase in safety is that previously demonstrated improvements in lateral and vertical control of the aircraft in flight should carry over to the landing situation. Alternatively, it is possible that, during approach and landing, the HUD might affect the pilot's ability to assimilate outside cues at the decision height, thereby reducing the success ratio for landings using an HUD.</excerpt>",2

2003,Background emotional dynamics of crew resource management: Shame emotions and coping responses,"<title>Background emotional dynamics of crew resource management: Shame emotions and coping responses</title> <excerpt>We propose emotional dynamics are involved in crewmembers' occasional failure to communicate relevant information or concerns in the cockpit. Pilots' normal coping responses to 1 of Silvan Tomkins's 9 basic affects, shame, may give rise to apprehensiveness about communicating unverified information, as well as behavioral emphasis on competence and professionalism, and even check-ride anxiety. Our data suggest that pilots are more excitement-hungry than nonpilots, and that this quality is associated with a tendency to avoid self-blame in awkward situations and to focus instead on excitement, enjoyment, or self-confidence.</excerpt>",-1

If the actual system behavior and the operator's 'mental model' are both described as finite state transition systems, then mechanized techniques known as 'model checking' can be used automatically to discover any scenarios that cause the behaviors of the two descriptions to diverge from one another. These scenarios identify potential surprises and pinpoint areas where design changes, or revisions to training materials or procedures, should be considered.</excerpt>",-1

Evidence from a number of industrial psychology studies indicates that workers’ perceptions of risk are influenced by the context and culture of their work environment, leading to different ‘worlds of risk’ between professional groups and levels of seniority within the work organization. If perception of risk and safety is not a unified phenomenon within organizational settings, how does one achieve the ‘shared attitudes, perceptions and beliefs with respect to risk and safety’ which are considered fundamental to the development and propagation of a good safety culture? Safety is a dynamic phenomenon that requires continual monitoring from a number of different perspectives in order to prevent incidents.</excerpt>",-1

Some theories argue for scalability by making the implicit assumption that complex tasks consist of many smaller parts, which are learned according to basic learning principles. Surprisingly, there has been rather sparse empirical testing of this crucial assumption. In this article, we examine this assumption directly by decomposing the learning in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air-Traffic Controller Task (Ackerman, 1988) from the learning at the global level all the way down to the learning at the keystroke level.</excerpt>",52

2000,Sharing the burden of flight deck automation training,"<title>Sharing the burden of flight deck automation training</title> <excerpt>Flight deck automation has generated new training requirements, most of which have been absorbed by in-house airline training, in particular, aircraft transition training. This leaves little room for learning about how human roles have shifted in automated cockpits or how the distinction between technical and nontechnical skills has become blurred when managing the flight path of an automated aircraft. This article explores how overall pilot training quality, efficiency, and effectiveness would benefit from pulling automation training forward into the pilot training curriculum, reducing the burden carried mainly by transition training today.</excerpt>",34

1997,Public policy and environmental noise: Modeling exposure or understanding effects,"<title>Public policy and environmental noise: Modeling exposure or understanding effects</title> <excerpt>This paper argues that if the federal government is to successfully protect the public from the adverse effects of environmental noise, its policies will need to be informed by a scientific understanding of the psychological and social factors that determine when noise results in annoyance and when noise may affect health as an environmental stressor. The overreliance of federal agencies on mathematical modeling of average group responses to physical noise levels is discussed as oversimplifying and limiting the understanding of noise effects in crucial ways. The development of a more sophisticated information base is related to policy needs, such as the need to make accurate predictions about the annoyance of particular communities, the need to understand relationships between public participation in noise abatement efforts and annoyance, and the need to identify populations that may be susceptible to stress-related health effects..</excerpt>",7

1997,A review of health effects of aircraft noise*,"<title>A review of health effects of aircraft noise*</title> <excerpt>Abstract:  Social surveys have established dose–response relationships between aircraft noise and annoyance, with a number of psychological symptoms being positively related to annoyance. Evidence that exposure to aircraft noise is associated with higher psychiatric hospital admission rates is mixed. Some evidence exists of an association between aircraft noise exposure and use of psychotropic medications.</excerpt>",7
1997,Symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies in international pilots,<title>Symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies in international pilots</title> <excerpt>Fatigue is a major problem for international aircrew flying transmeridian routes. One hundred eighty-eight international pilots responded to a questionnaire that assessed overall fatigue and the symptoms pilots associated with fatigue on duty. The questionnaire also assessed the methods used by pilots to cope with fatigue before a duty as well as on the flight deck.</excerpt>,1
1997,Effectiveness of institutionalized countermeasures on crew rest during rapid transitions from daytime to nighttime flying,"<title>Effectiveness of institutionalized countermeasures on crew rest during rapid transitions from daytime to nighttime flying</title> <excerpt>Aircrews frequently experience sleep loss when working rapidly rotating flight schedules. This study evaluated the efficacy of crew rest maintenance policies implemented by a school of aviation. After night flights, pilots living at home experienced daily reductions in sleep time, whereas pilots living under the school's regulations maintained equivalent sleep durations after day and night flights.</excerpt>",1
1997,Human factors analysis of postaccident data: Applying theoretical taxonomies of human error,"<title>Human factors analysis of postaccident data: Applying theoretical taxonomies of human error</title> <excerpt>Human error is involved in nearly all aviation accidents, yet most accident reporting systems are not currently designed around any theoretical human-error framework. As a result, subsequent postaccident databases generally are not conducive to traditional human factors analysis, making the identification of interventions extremely difficult. To address this issue, this study utilized 3 conceptual models of information processing and human error to reorganize the human factors database associated with U.S.</excerpt>",4

1997,Aviation Science? Collegiate Aviation? Aeronautics? Aerospace Science? Introducing Aeronology in Resolving Identity Issues,"<title>Aviation Science? Collegiate Aviation? Aeronautics? Aerospace Science? Introducing Aeronology in Resolving Identity Issues</title> <excerpt>In asking collegiate aviation educators for a term or a phrase that adequately describes their academic field, it does not take much time to discover that widespread agreement is notably absent. If we as aviation educators are unable to collectively identify ourselves and the niche we inhabit in the realm of the entire academic community, then how much more difficult will it be for the remainder of the academic community and the general public to identify us as well? There are three possible solutions for aviation educators to consider in confronting the identity problem. Educators can: (1) conclude that identity is really not a problem, (2) identify a term/phrase by consensus to describe the aviation field, or (3) create a new word..</excerpt>",93
1997,Optic flow and visual analysis of the base-to-final turn,"<title>Optic flow and visual analysis of the base-to-final turn</title> <excerpt>In the spirit of other optic flow research, we address the problem of how a pilot turns an airplane into alignment with a runway, a maneuver that is one of the more challenging phases of visually controlled flight. In earlier work, Loomis and Beall (1992) proposed a rule for turning an aircraft into alignment: Turn the aircraft in such a way as to hold constant the rate of change of splay (the angle the projected runway makes with respect to the vertical). The experiment presented in this article was a psychophysical test of this rule.</excerpt>",-1
1997,National culture and flight Deck automation: Results of a multination survey,"<title>National culture and flight Deck automation: Results of a multination survey</title> <excerpt>Attitudes regarding flight deck automation were surveyed in a sample of 5,879 airline pilots from 12 nations. The average difference in endorsement levels across 11 items for pilots flying automated aircraft in 12 nations was 53%, reflecting significant national differences in attitudes on all items, with the largest differences observed for preference and enthusiasm for automation. The range of agreement across nations was on average four times larger than the range of agreement across different airlines within the same nation, and roughly six times larger than the range across pilots of standard and pilots of automated aircraft.</excerpt>",34
1997,Large sample validations of three general predictors of pilot training success,<title>Large sample validations of three general predictors of pilot training success</title> <excerpt>This article addresses one of the perennial problems of pilot selection research: obtaining an adequate sample size for reliable statistical analysis of predictive validity. Results from three studies involving the same computerized tests of instrument comprehension and psychomotor ability were combined in a meta-analysis to determine whether the validities of these tests generalized across three contexts. These were Royal Air Force and Turkish Air Force fixed-wing pilot training and British Army Air Corps rotary-wing pilot training.</excerpt>,33

Causal model parameters were estimated separately for each sample and, due to the small sample size for women, no between-groups statistical tests were conducted. The results are viewed as tentative because of the small sample of female students; however, the path coefficient parameter estimates are still useful.</excerpt>",33
1997,A human error approach to accident investigation: The taxonomy of unsafe operations,"<title>A human error approach to accident investigation: The taxonomy of unsafe operations</title> <excerpt>Human error continues to be implicated in the vast majority of aviation accidents. Yet, most accident investigation and reporting systems are not currently designed around any theoretical framework of human error. One reason may be the discontinuity between classical theories of human error and the practical application of these theoretical approaches in accident investigation.</excerpt>",4
1997,Distributed representation as a principle for the analysis of cockpit information displays,"<title>Distributed representation as a principle for the analysis of cockpit information displays</title> <excerpt>This article examines the representational properties of cockpit information displays from the perspective of distributed representations (Zhang & Norman, 1994). The basic idea is that the information needed for many tasks in a cockpit is distributed across the external information displays in the cockpit and the internal minds of the pilots. It is proposed that the relative distribution of internal and external information is the major factor of a display's representational efficiency.</excerpt>",2

1996,Methodological Issues in Research on the Effects of Alcohol on Pilot Performance,"<title>Methodological Issues in Research on the Effects of Alcohol on Pilot Performance</title> <excerpt>The effects of low blood-alcohol levels on pilot performance have been found to be surprisingly inconsistent, given the variety of cognitive, attentional, and motor coordination processes involved in piloting tasks and the presumed susceptibility of these processes to alcohol. Discussed in this article are a number of methodological issues that are relevant to research in this area, including task and subject characteristics, compensation for alcohol effects, and experimental design procedure considerations. Such factors may complicate attempts to determine the relationship between blood-alcohol levels and pilot performance and lead to an underestimation of alcohol effects..</excerpt>",67

However, selecting the simulator lo use during evaluation is driven more by simulator usage costs and availability than by an analysis of the simulator features needed for an effective crcwslation evaluation. This problem stems in part from a lack of well-documented lessons learned in identifying which simulator features are required to produce the same results as those obtained in flight.</excerpt>",29

Exploring issues in evaluating the impact of programs to enhance crew coordination.</title> <excerpt>The question ""Is cockpit resource management effective?"" has been asked frequently in the years since 1979 when a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Industry workshop addressed the concepts of crew coordination and effective utilization of all available resources in flight operations (Cooper, White, & Lauber, 1980). If one looks at the proliferation of cockpit resource management (CRM) training programs in domestic and foreign, civil and military aviation, and the enormous investment in time and money that they entail, it would appear that the question has been answered in the affirmative. It is our position, however, that the question remains open and that empirical evidence is just beginning to accumulate..</excerpt>",10

With the aim of preventing and reducing such flight accidents, it is very important for pilots to have a precise knowledge of the possible illusory phenomena appearing during flight as well as to be cognisant of their forecast and, finally, to be aware and be able to apply immediately adequate preventive measures enabling them to avoid the loss of orientation during the various flight conditions. Therefore the author has examined the most frequent circumstances and conditions which, during the aerial navigation on aircrafts - not only at fixed wing but also at rotating wing - may facilitate the pilot in his spatial disorientation favoring the occurrence of mental conflict when there is a sensorial incongruity amongst the various erroneous sensations coming from the vestibular apparatus and or from the perceptive organs and an inadequate visual information.</excerpt>",13

Within the context of the disaster, the interaction of such factors as individual psychodynamics, small group processes, and intergroup dynamics can be examined.1 This paper deals with an existential and theoretical account of a particular disaster, the Kennedy Airport Snow-In of February, 1969, which may in some way illustrate behavioral phenomena common to events of this type. The empirical data derive from one of the authors, who was an affected passenger (C.A.H.).2 The gathering of data of a non personal nature, the integration of the collected information, and the conclusions drawn about intergroup phenomena presume a distance from the initial confusion.</excerpt>",-1

The conspicuity studies, using paired comparisons of model airplanes, gave evidence that: (a) amount of red-orange fluorescent paint coverage is positively correlated with conspicuity; (b) high brightness paints should be placed on the upper surfaces of the aircraft and low brightness paints on the lower portions; (c) maximizing brightness contrasts between different parts of the aircraft surfaces does not enhance conspicuity; (d) flight attitudes, backgrounds, lighting conditions, and differences in Ss did not affect conspicuity significantly. The attitude studies in which pilots matched the model airplanes in some 1 of 15 attitudes, with 1 of 15 models mounted on a small display, indicated that the paint patterns used did not aid the pilots in making judgments of aircraft attitude.</excerpt>",2

Several experimental designs were used. The results lead to the conclusion that a 24-hour dial, with minute and hourly numeral markings and with the 24-hour position at the bottom and the 60-minute position at the top of the dial is the most superior dial design in terms of efficiency, speed and accuracy.</excerpt>",1

Students' logs were evaluated for five separate missions by comparing the students' entries with standards determined by experts. The reliability of this technique is indicated by the fact that mission to mission inter-correlations of error scores were low, while the intercorrelations between legs of the same mission were moderately high.</excerpt>",-1
