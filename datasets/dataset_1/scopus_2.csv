"Leadership, safety climate, and neuroticism: Integrating organizational and individual factors into the prediction of air technicians’ safety behaviors","2026","Journal of Air Transport Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105021827104&partnerID=40&md5=488191b3ba53c3c84f489f412f48b575","Air technicians' safety behavior is crucial to aviation safety, and thus it is important to identify factors that may enhance such behavior and explore its mechanisms. By incorporating Safety-Specific Transformational Leadership (SSTL), safety climate, and neuroticism, this study examines whether, how, and when SSTL predicts air technicians' safety behaviors from the perspective of both organizational and individual factors. Correlation, mediation, and moderation analyses were conducted on data from a sample of 995 air technicians from six aviation enterprises in China. The results indicate that SSTL was positively related to air technicians' safety behavior and that this relationship was partially mediated by safety climate. Moreover, neuroticism moderated this effect, such that the positive relationship between SSTL and safety behavior was stronger in air technicians with a higher level of neuroticism. Theoretically, this study combines leadership and personality in a unified framework, enriching understanding of their joint role in predicting safety behaviors. Practically, it guides aviation enterprises to strengthen SSTL and adopt personality-sensitive management to enhance technicians’ safety behaviors. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd."
"Business travel stress and the moderating effect of corporate aircraft utilization on employee Well-Being: Business aviation from a stakeholder perspective","2026","Journal of Air Transport Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017573458&partnerID=40&md5=d97d70a0768a56579f3aa61718b19324","This study investigates how access to corporate aircraft moderates the relationship between business travel stress and employee well-being. Using the Job-Demands-Resources and Person-Environment Fit models, this research reveals that business travel stress relates to time pressure, travel environment, and work-family conflict, which affect physical, psychological, and social well-being. However, corporate aircraft use restores control, relieves stress, and reduces fatigue, emotional exhaustion, and work-family conflict. Additionally, it offers positive travel experiences that enhance employee energy, engagement, and job satisfaction. This study addresses a research gap by being the first to explore business travel stress and well-being in corporate aircraft operations, expanding the Job-Demands-Resources model. These findings provide a foundation for future research to further investigate the nuanced relationship between business travel stress and employee well-being. Organizations can benefit from the findings by redefining their business case for corporate aircraft, prioritizing stakeholder well-being as a primary source of return on investment. © 2025 The Authors"
"Flying high or saying goodbye? passenger incivility and flight attendants’ turnover intention: A serial mediation model of surface acting and emotional exhaustion","2026","Journal of Air Transport Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015435371&partnerID=40&md5=efccd260430bed082a8e7dea4ca7813b","This study aims to examine a serial mediation model in which passenger incivility affects emotional labour (i.e. surface acting), which in turn influences emotional exhaustion, which ultimately increases the intention to leave among flight attendants. The mediating roles of surface acting and emotional exhaustion are also examined in this model. Data from a sample of 203 flight attendants of major airlines in China was collected and analysed. The results indicate that passenger incivility does not directly influence turnover intention but that the link is partially mediated by emotional exhaustion. However, surface acting was found not to mediate the relationship between passenger incivility and turnover intention. This study is among the first to highlight the consequences of passenger incivility in the Chinese aviation industry. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"
"Threat anticipation and proactive response: The effect of defensive pessimism strategy on pilots' safety behavior","2026","Acta Psychologica","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105023996680&partnerID=40&md5=afd790552c1db690061c1b07930a1362","Human error is a significant cause of aviation accidents, and numerous individual psychological factors strongly influence pilots' safety behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to identify factors that may enhance pilots' safety behavior and explore their underlying mechanisms. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study examines whether, how, and under what conditions defensive pessimism affects pilots' safety behavior from a cognitive strategy perspective. Using a sample of 308 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model between defensive pessimism strategy and pilots' safety behaviors. The results indicate that defensive pessimism strategy has a direct positive effect on pilots' safety behavior and that this relationship is partially mediated by safety attitudes. Additionally, safety culture negatively moderates both the positive relationship between defensive pessimism strategy and safety attitudes and the indirect effects of this cognitive strategy on safety behavior through safety attitudes. On a theoretical level, this study first validates the effectiveness of the defensive pessimism strategy within the high-risk context of aviation safety, thereby advancing the understanding of its unique mechanisms. Second, by elucidating how individuals proactively employ specific cognitive strategies to shape behavioral attitudes and subsequently influence actual behavior, this study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior from a cognitive strategy perspective. Furthermore, it explores the boundary condition of safety culture, deepening our understanding of the interaction between organizational environments and individual cognitive strategies. Finally, on a practical level, this research offers valuable insights for aviation safety management, informing practices related to pilot selection, daily mental health support, and the exploratory development of the defensive pessimism strategy into a potential risk management tool. © 2025 The Authors"
"Fatigue risk management in healthcare: A scoping literature review","2026","International Journal of Nursing Studies","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105022195539&partnerID=40&md5=445c13ba8ac69bf3b8429528afd40364","Background: Occupational fatigue among healthcare professionals is a complex, multifaceted issue associated with increased likelihood of medical error, compromised patient safety and negative impacts on staff mental and physical health. While safety-critical sectors such as aviation and rail have implemented formal systems to manage fatigue-related risks, it remains unclear whether similarly structured approaches exist or operate effectively within healthcare. Objective: This scoping literature review aimed to examine the current state of knowledge regarding fatigue risk management strategies and countermeasures in healthcare and explore the barriers and facilitators to their implementation. This review sought to highlight gaps and provide insights into advancing fatigue risk management practices within the healthcare context. Methods: A systematic literature search to June 2025 was conducted across Medline, CINAHL Ultimate, and Scopus databases. Search terms were developed based on key concepts related to healthcare professions and fatigue risk management. Studies were included if they examined fatigue risk management strategies, countermeasures or organisational perceptions of fatigue in healthcare. Results: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, including quantitative (n = 18), qualitative (n = 9), and mixed-methods (n = 5) designs. Findings were grouped into conceptual categories based on the study focus and/or intervention type. The majority of studies (n = 18) evaluated isolated interventions including informal/individual fatigue management strategies, napping, use of biomathematical models to predict fatigue risk, fatigue education, and the impact of scheduling practices. Only two studies reported on comprehensive, multi-component programmes. Nine studies explored staff perceptions and attitudes towards fatigue-related strategies, and three examined broader organisational understanding or design principles related to fatigue management. Key barriers to implementation included normalised cultural attitudes towards fatigue, limited managerial support, and inadequate infrastructure. Facilitators included improved staffing levels, better workload distribution, supportive leadership, and the development of non-punitive safety cultures that encouraged fatigue reporting. Conclusions: Despite growing awareness of the risks associated with occupational fatigue, healthcare systems continue to rely on fragmented, informal, and largely individual approaches to fatigue management. In contrast to other high-risk industries, healthcare has yet to embed fatigue management within formal safety governance structures. Advancing practice in this area requires a shift towards system-level thinking that is supported by organisational leadership, effective fatigue monitoring, and workforce education. Additionally, this shift also demands a cultural reorientation that recognises fatigue as a predictable and manageable safety risk that necessitates organisational accountability rather than individual resilience to prioritise both staff wellbeing and patient safety. © 2025 The Authors"
"Predictive validity of cognitive abilities for air traffic controllers selection among proficient scientific candidates","2026","Applied Ergonomics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020850027&partnerID=40&md5=9bcfc8b32c7bd22c458c5e718c5d3758","Most air traffic controllers (ATCO) are selected after high school graduation, partly based on cognitive abilities. On the contrary, French ATCO are selected after an intensive scientific post-secondary program without undergoing cognitive assessment. This study examines the potential incremental validity of cognitive predictors in ATCO training for such proficient applicants. Initial and unit training results were available for 414 and 277 ATCO students, respectively. All students took cognitive ability tests, encompassing visuospatial processing, quantitative knowledge, and work samples. We compared a baseline regression model with academic performance as sole predictor to an extended model with the addition of the cognitive abilities composite score. The R2 of the extended model increased significantly, by 0.04 (p < .001) and 0.06 (p < .001), respectively, for predicting practical initial and unit training outcome. In conclusion, even for scientific proficient candidates, cognitive assessment can enhance the success rate of ATCO training. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd."
"Unraveling the complex relationships between mental health and safety operation behaviors among pilots: a network and latent profile analysis","2026","Current Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105026874485&partnerID=40&md5=83e0aed4677714362469c1c1185ceb1d","As the guardians of aviation safety, pilots’ mental health is critical for ensuring flight safety. However, systematic research on the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots remains scarce, and the relationship between these symptoms and safety operation behaviors is unclear. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the interrelations among mental symptoms in pilots and to explore how these symptoms are associated with safety operation behaviors. A total of 612 male commercial pilots participated in a cross-sectional survey that assessed nine types of mental symptoms and safety operation behaviors. Descriptive statistics, network analysis, and latent profile analysis were utilized to examine their relationships systematically. The study revealed significant interconnections among mental symptoms in pilots, with obsessive-compulsive symptoms playing a pivotal role in the comorbidity network. Pilots were categorized into three groups based on symptom severity: high-, medium-, and low-level symptom groups. Pilots in the high-level symptom group exhibited significantly poorer safety operation behaviors. Nearly half of the mental symptoms are indirectly linked to safety operation behaviors through comorbidities, and these comorbidities have a direct association with these behaviors. In the low-level symptom group, there was greater integration among safety operation behaviors, whereas the high-level symptom group showed dissociation. In the high-level symptom group, interpersonal communication and cooperation played a key role, while the role of understanding the automated system was weaker, which may be related to compensation mechanisms, automation bias, and blind reliance. This study systematically analyzed the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots and their complex relationship with safety operation behaviors. The findings provide practical insights for airline management to promote pilots’ mental health and enhance aviation safety protocols. Additionally, the study contributes to aviation psychology and safety research by offering evidence-based recommendations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2026."

The 2023 International Comfort Congress (ICC2023) brought together researchers and practitioners to explore how new contexts of use, predictive approaches, and user diversity are reshaping this field. Contributions in this special issue address comfort in automated driving and turboprop aviation, where physical, psychological, and environmental factors converge. Advances in predictive comfort science demonstrate how objective measures, physiological sensing, and modeling complement traditional self-reports. At the same time, inclusive design approaches—ranging from XR-based co-creation to analyses of posture and movement variability—highlight the importance of accounting for heterogeneous user needs and comfort trade-offs. Together, these studies illustrate a shift toward more adaptive, accessible, and sustainable systems, underscoring comfort as a multidimensional construct that evolves with technological innovation and societal change. © The Author(s) 2025"
"Research on the relationship between work-family conflict and burnout among civil aviation pilots after the COVID-19 pandemic","2026","PLOS ONE","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105026527002&partnerID=40&md5=ab36c077fca4ce1039f26a234747f73f","To examine the impact of work-family conflict on occupational burnout among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic, this study employed the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey and the Zhao Xinyuan Bi-directional Scale of Work-Family Conflict as research instruments. The data were analyzed using correlation analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to explore the relationship between work-family conflict and burnout. The results indicate a significant correlation between work-family conflict and burnout, as well as the three dimensions of burnout. Specifically, the correlation coefficients between work interfering with family (WIF) and family interfering with work (FIW) with occupational burnout were found to be 0.737 and 0.496, respectively. In the path analysis of the SEM, the estimated effects of WIF and FIW on burnout were both 0.49. Mediation analysis revealed that WIF indirectly influences burnout through FIW, with a mediation effect value of 0.117. Additionally, while pilot-related factors did not significantly affect burnout, they were found to have a notable impact on work-family conflict. These findings underscore the significant role of work-family conflict in contributing to burnout and provide a theoretical foundation for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating burnout among pilots. ©: © 2026 Chen et al.

"Assessing pilot cognitive overload risk with a random forest framework: A non-contact approach based on a novel cardiopulmonary feature","2026","International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105024436374&partnerID=40&md5=970b2d3c4824dfef35d97401d8f14241","Accurate, real-time assessment of operator mental workload(MWL) is critical for ensuring safety and efficiency in complex systems like aviation. However, existing methods are limited by the latency of subjective scales and the intrusiveness of contact-based physiological sensors. In order to address the challenge of real-time, interference-free monitoring of operator cognitive states in complex systems such as flight, this study proposes and validates a new non-contact psychological load assessment method based on cardiopulmonary coupling joint entropy. We recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration (RSP) signals from thirty flight trainees using a 77 GHz millimeter-wave radar as they performed a simulated flight task with four escalating levels of difficulty. Subjective workload ratings (NASA-TLX) and task performance were collected concurrently for validation. Results confirmed the experimental manipulation's effectiveness, with NASA-TLX scores(F (3,87) = 34.87, p <0.001), reaction times(F (3,87) = 25.712, p < 0.001), and error rates(F (3,87) = 34.881, p < 0.05) all increasing significantly with task difficulty. The joint entropy value exhibited a monotonic increase with workload levels(F (3,87) = 16.578, p = 0.002), demonstrating its high sensitivity. Feature importance analysis identified joint entropy as the most significant predictor of MWL. Notably, a classification model utilising only the joint entropy feature achieved superior predictive accuracy compared to a model using the full feature set, highlighting the metric's robustness and efficiency. This study validates non-contact cardiopulmonary coupling joint entropy as a sensitive and reliable biomarker for MWL. This method provides a practical path for developing intelligent safety management systems capable of warning of cognitive overload, preventing human errors, and promoting adaptive human-machine collaboration. These systems can serve as key inputs for AI-driven adaptive interfaces, promoting dynamic human-machine collaboration in line with Industry 5.0 principles. Relevance to industry: This study presents a practical approach to the real-time, objective and non-intrusive monitoring of operators' MWL in high-risk sectors such as aviation and nuclear power. The verified joint entropy index can be integrated into safety management systems to develop AI-powered intelligent assistance systems and adaptive human-machine interfaces that can dynamically adjust to the operator's cognitive state. These systems can warn of cognitive overload, effectively preventing human error and improving the overall safety and operational efficiency of complex systems. This method relies on a single efficient feature, which significantly simplifies the technical requirements for real-time deployment on board or on site. © 2025"

This study investigates the association between working environment stress and work performance among aviation crew members while examining the mediating role of mental health. Methods: A total of 19,137 aviation crew members (61.6% male), with a mean age of 32.2 ± 6.2 years, were included in the analysis. Working environment stress, anxiety, and depression were measured by the Nordic Work Psychiatry and Social Factors Questionnaire (QPS-Nordic), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. Use the single item in the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire to evaluate work performance. Unordered logistic regression analyzed the relationship between working environment stress and work performance, whereas mediation analysis examined the role of anxiety and depression. Results: Results showed that 51.6% of aviation crew members reported medium to high levels of working environment stress, with 7.3% showing anxiety and 11.7% experiencing depression. Compared to low stress, moderate stress increased the odds of poor work performance by 2.38 times (odds ratio [OR] =2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.17–2.61), and high stress by 2.48 times (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 2.17–2.83). Higher working environment stress was linked to increased risks of anxiety and depression, which mediated 68.2% and 71.8% of the relationship between working environment stress and work performance, respectively. Conclusion: High working environment stress among aviation crew can lower work performance, mediated by anxiety and depression. Prioritizing mental health and stress management is crucial to prevent negative impacts. © 2025 Asian Journal of Social Health and Behavior."

We present a score-based causal representation model that captures causal structural diversity and spatio-temporal dependencies within single channels and inter-dependencies among multiple channels. By optimizing a score-based causal function under causal Markov property constraints, the model disentangles latent spatio-temporal features into causal and task-irrelevant groups.

Background: The PBM is a set of computerized tests used as a part of the ASTB to select aviators in the U.S. military. Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick and throttle used on the PBM. Method: Our between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video. Results: The results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM’s two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device. Conclusion: The results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This indicates that transfer effects from alternative input devices depend in part on properties of the task. Application: This research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection. © 2025 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"

Participants completed Airbus A320 takeoff simulations under normal and emergency conditions. The study employed a Split-Plot Design, with experience level as the between-subjects factor and flight scenarios as the within-subjects factor, comprising two rounds of six scenarios repeated twice. Results reveal that experts exhibited lower stress levels and cognitive demands than novices, especially in high-pressure conditions. Furthermore, a learning curve effect was evident, as repeated exposure reduced stress and improved performance for all participants.

This study investigates the relationship between cognitive workload, stress, and facial thermal responses during simulated Airbus A320 takeoff procedures. Utilizing a multimodal approach, facial thermography, heart rate monitoring, and EEG-derived workload measures were recorded from ten participants—five with and five without prior simulation experience—while they navigated 12 distinct flight scenarios comprising both standard and engine failure conditions. The experimental design featured two rounds of simulation tasks interleaved with rest periods to capture both cooling (during task performance and stress) and warming (rest and recovery) phases. Results revealed that elevated cognitive workload induced significant cooling across the nose, forehead, and cheeks, with the nasal region exhibiting the most rapid and pronounced temperature decline. These thermal changes were synchronized with increases in heart rate and subjective workload ratings, thereby validating the use of facial thermography as an objective, real-time indicator of stress. Additionally, preliminary analyses suggest that individual differences, such as prior simulation experience, moderate the magnitude of these physiological responses. The findings underscore the potential of integrating facial thermal imaging into cockpit monitoring systems as an early warning mechanism for cognitive overload.

However, the operational principles of these engines generate significant exhaust noise, which compromises both the stealth capabilities of drones and human physical and mental health. The installation of a muffler in two-stroke engines can increase back pressure within the cylinder, leading to a reduction in power output. To optimize the balance between power performance and noise reduction in two-stroke engines, this study focuses on an aviation piston two-stroke engine as the subject of investigation. By developing a comprehensive flow model of the engine, it undertakes a detailed analysis of the exhaust flow characteristics and energy properties within the exhaust pipe and muffler, which integrate the scavenging, combustion, and exhaust processes. This approach enables the identification of the dissipation pattern of exhaust energy throughout the entire flow domain. A genetic optimization algorithm is utilized to design the engine's exhaust structure, and a detailed mechanism analysis of the exhaust system was performed via 3D acoustics and fluid dynamics simulations. The findings reveal that, compared to conventional mufflers, the optimized muffler developed in this study achieves a noise reduction of 41.7 dB, while the power loss decreases from 16.6 % to 5.6 %.

Currently, EEG-based emotion recognition is hindered by challenges with cumbersome equipment, complex procedures, and low recognition accuracy. Here, this study presents a novel method for portable EEG-based emotion recognition utilizing flexible electrodes on hairless scalp regions. First, flexible brain electrodes are prepared, aiming to enhance the comfort and convenience of emotional EEG signals in hairless regions. Furthermore, a hemisphere global convolutional neural network (HGCNN) model is designed to address the asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex while overcoming challenges associated with limited channel availability in portable EEG-based emotion recognition. On the publicly available DEAP dataset, the HGCNN model achieved average recognition accuracies of 92.55% and 93.22% on the valence and arousal dimensions, respectively. In addition, on a specialized hairless emotion EEG dataset (HED), the HGCNN model attains an average recognition accuracy of 88%. Finally, combining virtual reality (VR) technology to simulate extreme environments, such as falling and weightlessness. Under these conditions, we collected emotional EEG signals and analyzed them utilizing the HGCNN model. The results show that the HGCNN model can effectively identify emotional fluctuations experienced by subjects over time, which is expected to promote the application of portable emotion EEG recognition technology in daily life and specialized extreme contexts such as aviation, aerospace, and maritime settings. © 2001-2012 IEEE."

Given the heterogeneous findings in previous research, further investigation into the impact of environmental noise on brain health and cognitive function is crucial. This study explores the relationship between both objective and subjective residential noise exposure and cognitive functioning, as well as markers of brain damage, in a large adult population. The analysis also considers dementia risk factors and demographic variables for a comprehensive understanding. METHOD: Cross-sectional data on cognitive functioning and brain volumes (MRI markers) from 4,018 Dutch participants aged 40-75 from The Maastricht Study were matched with address-level noise exposure data (noise: from roads, railways, aviation, industry, and wind turbines) from the Geoscience and Health Cohort Consortium. Subjective noise exposure (traffic, work, and neighbor noise) was assessed via self-report questionnaires. Linear and non-linear relationships were explored using multiple regression analyses and restricted cubic splines, adjusted for air pollution, demographic and dementia risk factors. Pathways via hearing loss, daytime sleepiness, and depression were also assessed through interaction analyses. RESULT: Higher residential noise exposure was linked to lower white matter (WM) volume and higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume. An U-shaped relationship was observed between residential noise and grey matter (GM) volume. Objective noise exposure was not associated with cognitive function. Subjective noise exposure at work was associated with worse overall cognition, memory, and executive functioning and attention. Interaction analyses for hearing loss, daytime sleepiness, and depression did not alter the results. Sensitivity analyses revealed a significant positive interaction between objective noise and age for CSF volumes. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that higher residential noise exposure is associated with brain atrophy (lower WM and higher CSF volumes), while the relationship with GM was unexpected. Additionally, subjective noise exposure at work was linked to worse cognitive performance, suggesting a discrepancy between objective and subjective noise effects. Lastly, older individuals might be more vulnerable to the effects of noise exposure.

This study investigates associations between environmental noise exposure (objective and self-reported), cognitive functioning, and structural brain markers in a large adult population, while considering psychological, sensory, sociodemographic, and health-related modifiers. Methods Cross-sectional data from 4,023 participants (aged 40–75 years) in The Maastricht Study were matched with address-level noise data (roads, railways, aviation, industry, wind turbines) and self-reported noise exposure (traffic, work, neighbors). Cognitive functioning and brain-MRI markers were analyzed using linear/logistic regression and restricted cubic splines, adjusted for demographics, cardiometabolic/lifestyle factors, and air pollution. Modifying roles of sleepiness, depression, socioeconomic position, cardiometabolic health and hearing loss were assessed through interaction analyses. Results Objective noise exposure showed no association with cognitive function, while work-related noise was associated with worse overall cognition, memory, executive functioning, and information processing speed. Higher environmental noise was linked to lower white matter volume, higher cerebrospinal fluid volume, and a U-shaped relationship with grey matter volume. The association with cerebrospinal fluid was stronger in older individuals and those with cardiometabolic or lifestyle risk factors. Sleepiness, depression, and hearing loss did not modify results. Conclusion Higher environmental noise exposure is associated with more brain atrophy, while reported noise at work was linked to lower cognitive functioning. The U-shaped grey matter association may reflect compensatory or adaptive responses to extreme exposure. Findings highlight differences between objective and self-reported noise measures, sources, and indicate groups with higher vulnerability. © 2025 The Authors."
"The role of psychological stress in the subjective well-being of aviation ground crews: mediating effects of social support and self-esteem","2025","BMC Public Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014999460&partnerID=40&md5=505efdf8ba50112633d271f89d717b81","Background: This study investigated the relationship between psychological stress and subjective well-being among aviation ground crews, with a focus on the mediating roles of social support and self-esteem. Methods: In this cross-sectional investigation, 533 ground crew members completed validated assessments, including the Stress Self-evaluation Test, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Self-liking/Self-competence Scale-Revised, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. Statistical analyses were performed via R software and Mplus. Results: (1) Single participants presented significantly lower subjective well-being than married individuals did (p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.349). (2) Psychological stress (r = – 0.527, p < 0.001), social support (r = 0.579, p < 0.001), and self-esteem (r = 0.678, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with subjective well-being. (3) Three distinct mediation pathways emerged: the social support-mediated pathway, self-esteem-mediated pathway, and a chain-mediating effect through social support-self-esteem. Conclusions: Psychological stress was significantly associated with reduced subjective well-being in aviation ground crews, with tentative evidence of mediation through social support and self-esteem. Interventions targeting these psychosocial resources may improve well-being, but require further validation. © The Author(s) 2025."

It affects individuals' mental health, thus posing a substantial threat to positive work outcomes and organisational performance. This study examines the influence of family incivility on airline transport pilots' burnout through the mediating role of happiness at work (HAW) and the moderating role of psychological capital (PsyCap). Cross-sectional survey data was collected from 274 pilots employed in China's main commercial airlines. The findings of partial least squares structural equation modelling show that family incivility directly influences HAW and burnout, with HAW partially mediating the relationship between family incivility and burnout. In addition, PsyCap was found to be a critical resource that indirectly impacts family incivility and burnout via HAW, as well as a moderator of the effect of family incivility on HAW. These findings have important implications for pilots' HAW, which, if appropriately addressed, can contribute to improving emotional stressors and alleviating burnout. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

Here, we investigate atmospheric dispersal of volcanic emissions, whether and how they infiltrate aircraft, and whether ground-level public health exposure thresholds can be related to the pressurised cabin environment. We then review the limited evidence for physical and mental health, and behavioural impacts, resulting from volcanic emissions entering aircraft. Serious health risks are considered low for healthy individuals, but respiratory irritation is likely for a high exposure scenario to sulfur dioxide (SO<inf>2</inf>). Asthmatics are particularly sensitive to SO<inf>2</inf>, with even relatively low, short exposures, potentially resulting in severe respiratory impacts. Negative group behaviours are not expected but individual distress is possible. Communicating this evidence to the aviation industry may result in more informed decision-making on flightpath alterations and triggering of emergency protocols, both before and during volcanic emission encounters. © The Author(s) 2025."

The leadership and teamwork competency of the flight crew in the cockpit directly influences the occurrence of aviation safety incidents. Leadership is a developmental and trainable skill. This study aims to explore the key components of leadership and the competency model for civil aviation flight cadets. Based on classic leadership theories and leadership development theories, the research adopts a qualitative analysis using grounded theory and utilizes Nvivo 11.0 software for data analysis. An initial leadership evaluation index system for flight cadets was developed. Through a survey of 319 civil aviation pilots and using SPSS 26.0 software for data processing, an evaluation index system was established, covering 4 dimensions—core values, leader competency, outstanding thinking, and positive behavior—with 22 indicators. The study also applied AMOS 24.0 software to conduct validation factor analysis and path analysis and construct the BLVT model of leadership development for civil aviation flight cadets. The findings indicate that, within the 4 dimensions of leadership and the BLVT model, core values influence positive behavior through leader competency and outstanding thinking, resulting in appropriate performance by flight cadets. Outstanding thinking directly affects leader competency, thereby driving the leadership development of flight cadets, who form the development of their leadership skills by recognizing their leadership competencies. The results of this study clarify the 4 key elements of leadership composition and development for civil aviation flight cadets, providing valuable insights into leadership training and development. This study significantly contributes to bridging the gap in civil aviation pilot leadership training and offers a clear pathway for enhancing pilot leadership. © The Author(s) 2025."

So far, only a few publications have reported the AFMC of multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). This study aims to explore the leader–follower reinforcement learning-based fractional-order sliding mode AFMC (RL-based FOSMAFMC) approach for ASVs with safety constraints subjected to time-varying actuator faults. A barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is utilized to keep the ASVs operating within a constrained safety range. The problem of loss of control direction due to the time-varying actuator effectiveness faults is addressed using the Nussbaum function. The RL is formulated using the actor–critic framework. The actor approximates the uncertain nonlinearities and time-varying bias faults, whereas the critic system assesses the control action while minimizing a long-term cost function. The leader–follower AFMC uses a fractional-order sliding mode surface to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness. A Lyapunov function is used to guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop system. Simulation experiments and performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the capability of the proposed controller. © 2025 Elsevier B.V."

Traditional workload assessments, such as questionnaires or task-based performance metrics, provide useful insights but can be limited in rapidly changing flight environments. Physiological measures, including heart rate, respiration, and electroencephalogram (EEG), offer continuous data streams, yet their variability and complexity present challenges for analysis. This study explores the use of a hierarchical Bayesian framework to quantify patterns from physiological signals recorded during high-fidelity flight simulations. Five certified pilots flew scenarios that varied in automation level and working memory demand while heart rate, respiration rate, and EEG-derived workload estimates were monitored. The model generated individualized and condition-specific estimates, quantified uncertainty, and remained stable with a small participant pool. Heart rate appeared to be the most consistent indicator, followed by EEG-derived workload, while respiration rate was less reliable across conditions. These results suggest that Bayesian inference may provide a promising way to interpret physiological data in aviation settings and could support the development of adaptive automation that responds to pilot workload. The approach emphasizes transparency and efficiency, offering complementary value to existing modeling techniques for aerospace human factors and flight deck applications. © 2025 by the authors."

Spatial disorientation accounts for 20-38% of fatal military aviation accidents, but case reports describing specific illusions during actual flight are rare. CASE REPORT: On a clear night, an aerial refueling tanker was cruising at 16,000 ft (4877 m), while an F-15I fighter aircraft was 3 mi behind and 971 ft (296 m) below. About 100 s before a near collision, the fighter pilot switched to Air-to-Air mode, displaying the distance and speed difference to the tanker via a Target Designator box on the Head-Up Display. However, the crew did not realize they were accelerating toward the tanker [from 597-663 ft · s-1 (182-202 m · s-1)] or climbing by 738 ft (225 m). The two aircraft came within 49 ft (15 m) of each other before the navigator noticed the tanker and initiated a roll to the left. DISCUSSION: The dip illusion occurs when a pilot flying in trail attempts to maintain the image of the lead aircraft in a fixed position on the windscreen as separation increases, which can lead to unintentional descent. In this case, we propose a ""reverse-dip"" illusion. The fighter crew was unaware they were closing in on the tanker, causing the Target Designator box to rise in the Head-Up Display. The pilot instinctively pulled back on the stick to maintain the box's position, resulting in an unintentional climb. Recognizing how such illusions develop in flight is essential to reducing future risks. Nakdimon I, Gordon B. Spatial disorientation event during flight due to proposed reverse-dip visual illusion.

Nineteen participants completed, in a randomized order, two simulated SHAT, 1 week apart, each lasting 4 h and 2 h, followed by a control condition (CON). Generic (10-m sprint, repeated sprint ability; RSA, countermovement jump; CMJ), sport-specific performance (Hoff Test, Loughborough Soccer Passing Test; LSPT), and psychophysiological responses (sleep, heart rate variability [HRV], salivary cortisol and immunoglobulin-A [sIgA], and perceptual recovery) were evaluated before (Baseline) and after each condition. Compared to Baseline, RSA and 10-m sprint declined by 3.5% and 6%, respectively, on the day after travel (D + 1) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01). Likewise, CMJ and total distance covered during the Hoff test decreased by 5.5% at D + 1 (p < 0.001). LSPT performance decreased only after the 4 h flight (p < 0.05). Total sleep time was reduced the night before SHAT (p < 0.001) compared to Baseline. sIgA was reduced on the day of the travel (DT) and D + 1 after both SHAT, while HRV was decreased at DT only after the 4 h SHAT (p < 0.05). Mood states remained unaffected by travel, regardless of duration. We currently suggest that short-haul air travel, whether 4 or 2 h, induces psychophysiological perturbations and performance deterioration, likely due to the travel restrictive conditions and the inadequate sleep obtained the night before the flight. Since both flights were conducted early in the morning, more research is warranted to investigate the role of departure time on football performance. © 2025 The Author(s).

Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Social Learning Theory (SLT), the research emphasizes the importance of motivation-driven instruction in preparing students for Industry 4.0. Data were collected from 229 final-year students at four Indonesian aviation polytechnic institutions. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the findings reveal that lecturer behavior significantly enhances student self-motivation (β = 0.911, p = 0.000) and soft skill competency (β = 0.124, p = 0.044). Student self-motivation also positively affects the quality of learning (β = 0.925, p = 0.000), which in turn contributes to hard skill competency (β = 0.449, p = 0.000). However, soft skill competency does not significantly influence learning quality (β = 0.004, p = 0.464), suggesting its greater impact lies in workplace adaptability rather than academic performance. These findings accentuate the need for vocational curricula that integrate motivational teaching practices with industry-relevant skill development to optimize student readiness for professional challenges. © 2025 The Authors"

While previous research has primarily examined how trust in the government influences personal health decisions, such as individual vaccination choices, this article explores the role of trust in shaping support for collective public health measures like vaccine mandates. Unlike individual vaccine acceptance, which focuses on the costs and benefits of personal health decisions, supporting vaccine mandates requires individuals to weigh community health benefits against the potential restriction of others' autonomy. Insufficient support for these measures can undermine a government's ability to achieve its public health objectives. Longitudinal panel data from 2020 to 2023 were used to assess how trust in the President and state governor affects support for universal and air travel COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the U.S. Analyses show that higher trust in the President and state governor correlates with greater support for vaccine mandates. The impact of trust in the President on support varies depending on the severity of the health threat, economic conditions, and political ideology, while the influence of trust in the state governor on support remains consistent regardless of these factors. To garner public support for health mandates that limit citizens' autonomy and achieve public health objectives, both federal and state leaders need to foster public trust.

Just as the mental workload in student pilots fluctuates during training, so does the mental workload of the instructors, affecting their dyadic performance and judgment. This paper explored how training environments (simulated vs. real flight), flight control conditions (student pilot flying vs. monitoring), and flight phases (take-off vs. downwind vs. landing) could affect mental workload in student and instructor pilots, as well as their interpersonal coordination through electrocardiography (ECG) based measures. Student pilots performed four consecutive standard flight traffic patterns with an instructor in a simulator and in real flight, under different flight control conditions of varying workload demands, while their ECG signals were recorded. The results indicated different patterns of interpersonal coordination between simulated and real flight. The other experimental variables, i.e., flight control and flight phase, mostly had an effect on participants’ heart rate and heart rate variability. In accordance with the existing literature, heart rate increased in high workload conditions and flight phases, whilst heart rate variability decreased. Additionally, we observed a linear relationship between subjective workload and physiological synchrony which indicates that student-instructor coordination increased as the student pilot experienced more mental workload in the flight tasks. The current study highlights that individual workload as well as dyadic workload, measured through cardiac signals, can be used to evaluate student-instructor coordination during flight training as an indicator of training outcomes. © 2025 The Authors"

This review of theoretical and experimental studies of the quantum nature of the psyche and consciousness is based on the author's results showing the connection between quantum and mental processes. Numerous studies confirm the quantum nature of mental processes and consciousness. The author introduced the concept of an elementary unit (quantum) of consciousness and proposed a formula for calculating the degree of consciousness of any living organism. Analysis of the presented data leads to the conclusion that adequate modeling and reproduction of mental processes with the manifestation of consciousness and multifunctional intelligence is possible only on quantum computers with a structure corresponding to the real structure of the psyche. It is well described by the extended information model of the psyche, proposed by the author, in socionics (or psychoinformatics) as the theory of information metabolism. Socionics is a science about the information interaction of the psyche with the outside world, the models of which are effectively used in practice in psychology, psychiatry, aviation, astronautics, management, pedagogy, sports, etc., because they adequately describe mental processes, differences in the strategies of behavior and thinking of people. The author significantly developed the basic socionic model, introducing the coordinating function of consciousness and the description of the internal structure of mental functions, and showed that the hierarchy of these functions can be modeled as a special system from a number of specialized quantum processors. This provides the basis for the development of a fundamentally new architecture of future quantum systems of artificial intelligence. © 2025 River Publishers. All rights reserved."

These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots. Method: A sample of 200 pilots completed validated self-report measures: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro. Results: Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = −0.46, p < 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p < 0.01. Conclusions: Resilience emerged as both a direct and indirect buffer against psychological strain in aviation. These findings underscore the importance of promoting adaptive coping and resilience training, alongside effective fatigue management, to enhance pilot well-being and maintain safety in aviation systems. © 2025 by the authors."

However, subtle but safety-significant post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments may go unreported or undetected. The Trail Making Test (TMT) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) can detect these impairments in domains essential to pilot performance, though further investigation is needed to assess their effectiveness and clinical utility in routine pilot aeromedical examinations. This short communication presents preliminary findings for using these tests. METHODS: A study identified the TMT and SDMT as appropriate screening tools for evaluating pilot neurocognitive performance after COVID-19. Mixed methods were then used to compare the screening tools' performance between post-COVID-19 cases and healthy controls, while also assessing their acceptability and feasibility in routine aeromedical examinations for pilots. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 neurocognitive disorders affect skills that are essential for pilot performance. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tests, with area under the curve values of 0.853 for TMT Part B, 0.817 for the SDC version of SDMT, and 0.769 for TMT Part A, indicating their effectiveness in identifying cognitive impairments. Airline pilots considered screening an important flight safety intervention. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots, together with international aviation psychologists and aviation medicine experts, endorsed the safety-critical importance and value of screening pilots for post-COVID-19 impairments. Given the numerous practical implications of implementing such a strategy, we recommend that pilots be screened for potential post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments. A larger study is necessary to validate these preliminary findings and recommendations. Beka SG, Griffiths RF, Myers JA, Skirrow PM.

"Medical Reporting Behavior of Military, Commercial, and General Aviation Pilots","2025","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017656774&partnerID=40&md5=70f32ffcc8fb90dd849e7b08a7309264","INTRODUCTION: Pilots are undoubtedly among employees who undergo rigorous medical evaluations to ensure they are fit to fly. However, accidents like the Germanwings Flight 9525 highlight that medically unfit individuals can still end up in the cockpit. METHODS: This study sought to investigate Greek pilots' attitudes toward medical reporting, given that the available national research is very limited. Semistructured interviews were conducted and analyzed through Thematic Analysis with subjects (N = 18) from general, military, and commercial aviation in Greece during the first quarter of 2024. Cross-sectoral differences were identified through Content Analysis. RESULTS: The primary barrier to medical reporting, identified by 16 out of 18 subjects (88% of the sample), was the fear of losing their pilot license, which would have major consequences for their income and way of life. Additionally, concerns about the perceived damage to professional identity and a deep passion for flying contributed to their reluctance to disclose medical issues. A general tendency to conceal medical problems from the Aeromedical Examiner during the annual medical certificate renewal was identified, particularly when such issues were considered of minor importance (61% of the sample). DISCUSSION: Although the findings align with international research, this study identified a more pronounced tendency among subjects to conceal medical issues they perceived as unimportant. The establishment of compulsory loss-of-pilot-license insurance was the major mitigation measure proposed by the interviewees. Nonetheless, its effectiveness remains questionable according to the literature, and further research is recommended in this area. Kioulepoglou P, Makris I.

"A systematic review on the impact of climate change on occupational mental health: a focus on vulnerable industries","2025","Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007343946&partnerID=40&md5=45220bf45e098b0655d33f2b8da2447d","Aims: This systematic review aims to examine how climate change and its related stressors may affect the mental health of workers in industries vulnerable to climate change. The review also seeks to evaluate coping strategies used by affected workers, as well as potential interventions to mitigate and prevent these mental health effects. Method: A literature search was conducted in June 2024 in databases such as PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science, using a combination of keywords about climate change, mental health or illness, and vulnerable industries. Results: A predominance of accessed literature was related to the agricultural industry, with a minority pertaining to the aquaculture, construction and aviation industries. They suggest an increased vulnerability of workers to mental health-related problems, including increased depression, anxiety, psychological distress and suicidality in response to stressors such as increased temperatures and prolonged drought conditions. Besides socioeconomic effects resulting from reduced productivity, climate-related stressors may contribute to increased uncertainty, isolation, a perceived lack of control, and challenges to their sense of identity. Coping methods varied and influenced outcomes of mental wellbeing, with community wellbeing and social connectedness in the agricultural setting being observed to have beneficial effects on levels of psychological distress. Interventions that promoted mental health literacy, the availability of mental health first aid, social cohesion, and adaptability to climate stressors were deemed helpful. Conclusion: Environmental stressors interact with mental health in an intricate manner, exerting influence on biological and socioeconomic aspects of a person’s well-being. In an occupational setting, such stressors may also affect social cohesion and one’s personal sense of identity or self-esteem. Building strong social networks and structures to enable self-efficacy and adaptability towards climate change may be key towards promoting mental health resilience amongst workers in vulnerable industries. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2025."
"Quantifying the Impact of Spatial Disorientation on Pilot Mental Workload and Attentional Focus","2025","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002442469&partnerID=40&md5=4afcad366cea72bfbe63750185563303","Objective: We aimed to find objective measures of the impact of spatially disorienting (SD) stimuli on pilot cognition in an ecologically valid environment. Background: SD frequently occurs in military rotary-wing operations and often contributes to mishaps. Effects of SD stimuli on pilots are usually quantified using control errors, but effects on cognition have not yet been successfully quantified. Method: Military helicopter pilots (n = 14) performed scenarios with six SD stimuli (SD condition) and six corresponding control stimuli (NoSD condition) in a motion-base simulator with integrated virtual reality headset. SD stimuli were: false horizon, featureless terrain, leans, brownout, a somatogyral yaw illusion, and loss of horizon due to night vision goggles (NVGs). Mental workload was measured using auditory arithmetic task performance and attentional focus was measured using eye-tracking. Results: Average arithmetic task performance was significantly impaired, and proportional gaze dwell time on the attitude indicator was significantly increased in the SD compared to the NoSD condition. Of the six SD stimuli, the featureless terrain, the leans, and the brownout induced significant effects on performance, whereas the featureless terrain, brownout, and false horizon significantly affected gaze behavior. The NVGs and somatogyral yaw stimuli did not induce significant effects. Pilots’ self-reports indicated awareness of all SD stimuli, except for the featureless terrain. Conclusion: The results indicate that SD impacts pilot mental workload and attentional focus. Application: Modern military aircraft present a large volume of mission-related information to pilots. This study shows that SD stimuli may negatively impact the processing of such information. © 2025 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

With Asia's aviation economic expansion and diverse cultural landscapes, the aviation industry has a role in linking nations, facilitating cultural exchange, and enhancing cross-border cooperation. In the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the aviation industry in Asia has faced unprecedented challenges. This study aims to provide an overview of the performance of nine national airlines in the Asian aviation market, using cross-efficiency evaluation combined with the Regret theory based on the DEA model. Traditional DEA models often utilize a self-evaluation mode to evaluate DMUs, resulting in drawbacks such as overestimating efficiency and incomplete ranking. Cross-efficiency evaluation has addressed these limitations. However, cross-efficiency evaluation overlooks the significance of the irrational psychology of decision-makers (DMs). Hence, this study utilizes the Regret theory to depict the regret aversion behavior of DMs. The integration of emotional factors in assessing operational performance offers a holistic view of airlines' challenges and opportunities after the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning for the industry's revival. © 2024 The Authors"
"Vection Measured During the 2023 Military Health Service Research Symposium Using a Virtual Reality Headset","2025","Military Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016529596&partnerID=40&md5=77cd4386d17df28aa2e085b4364db14e","Introduction Vection, a stationary individual's illusion of self-motion, is a form of spatial disorientation (SD) typically provoked visually. In aviation, SD is a failure to correctly sense one's position, motion, and/or attitude in relation to the earth's surface and its gravitational vertical. The Virtual Reality Vection System (VRVS) induces vection with visual virtual reality (VR) technology. During MHSRS 2023, USAARL demonstrated the VRVS at its Command Booth, which included an approved, exempt protocol to conduct a vection experiment on site. This exploratory study is reported here. Materials and Methods The Vive Pro Eye VR headset presented the computer-controlled vection stimuli. Each trial included 2 45-second frames of moving black dots separated by a 15-second blank field. Frame 1 presented 250 randomly spaced dots moving uniformly to the right at 40°/second, illustrating the 100% vection perception. Frame 2 also presented 250 dots moving at 40°/second, but the number of uniformly moving dots was randomly selected from the set {0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250} while the complement number of dots moved randomly. Data collected were vection duration and magnitude experienced during Frame 2 relative to the 100% Frame 1 vection percept. The subject's button press (BP) and linear potentiometer (LP) settings registered the vection duration and magnitude, respectively. Results Average BP and LP values were systematically dependent on the number of uniformly moving dots, increasing from 0 to 50 and then to 100 dots, then remaining relatively constant to 200 dots, then further increased with 250 dots, thus demonstrating a systematic psychophysical dependence of vection on quantifiable stimulus motion characteristics. Discussion and Conclusion The VRVS successfully used consumer-grade VR technology to execute a quantitative psychophysical pilot study of vection under the uncontrolled conditions of the MHSRS Exhibit Hall. Virtual reality technology can be expected to play an increasing role in supporting research designed for computer-controlled studies at remote sites. © 2025 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States."

METHODS: A total of 8 experienced U.S. Army test pilots completed 24 flights across 3 distinct route designs using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Vertical Motion Simulator, with airspeeds ranging from 120 to 240 kn. Analysis focused on EEG Beta/(Alpha + Theta) ratios as indicators of changing cognitive engagement over time. RESULTS: Analyses revealed distinct cognitive engagement patterns across routes: highly variable individual responses in routes with changing navigation demands, more consistent cognitive engagement in systematic route designs, and intermediate variability in mixed-demand routes. Airspeed effects on cognitive engagement became particularly pronounced above 200 kn, though these effects varied significantly by route and individual pilot. Temporal analysis demonstrated evolving patterns of cognitive adaptation, with routes eliciting different progression patterns over extended flight periods. Regression analysis showed that EEG Beta/(Alpha+Theta) values increased significantly during all three routes, with mean increases ranging from 0.0051-0.0146. DISCUSSION: These findings provide quantifiable metrics for optimizing route design, developing personalized training approaches, and implementing real-time monitoring systems for enhanced aviation safety and performance.

In safety–critical environments, this ability can influence risk perception and decision-making. Objective: This systematic literature review (SLR) assesses how EI affects risk-related behaviors in domains such as aviation, ground transportation, healthcare, and psychology. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched four databases (2010–2024). After screening, 18 empirical studies spanning trait, ability, and mixed EI models were included and analyzed via narrative synthesis. Results: Across all safety–critical domains, individuals with higher EI consistently exhibit safer decision-making and engage in fewer risk-taking behaviors. For example, pilots with higher EI show better situational awareness and decision-making performance; drivers with higher EI have fewer traffic violations; and nurses with higher EI report fewer unsafe practices. EI also appears to buffer against cognitive biases such as overconfidence and sensation-seeking, which adversely impact risk perception. Implications: These findings suggest that EI training can improve risk management and occupational safety in high-risk industries. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of EI on risk perception and develop targeted, domain-specific interventions. This review offers a novel cross-domain perspective, extending beyond prior single-domain studies to reveal a broadly protective role of EI in safety–critical settings. © 2025 The Author(s)"

Total years of experience and experience in the current role are, on the other hand, the most influential demographic information. Combining personality traits with demographic information can improve safety attitude predictions. Nevertheless, definitive causal inferences cannot be established, as further analysis is required to verify the suitability of the Random Forest algorithm relative to other machine learning algorithms. © 2025 The Author(s)"

The public's emotional responses and attitudes toward air travel are shaped by factors such as the severity of the incident and its social repercussions. Objectives: The study analyzes how the Chinese public's concerns, emotional responses, attributions, and attitudes toward air travel change following aviation accidents with varying severity and social impact. Additionally, it extends the application of the emotion-social information model in disaster scenarios and online behavior, providing valuable insights for crisis management. Method: The study employs the LDA topic model to identify public concerns, sentiment analysis with an affective dictionary, and Naive Bayes for emotional attribution. Comments before and after the incidents were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank tests to assess changes in attitudes toward air travel. Results: Public attention focused on victims, causes, and crew responses. Severe accidents elicited sadness, while less severe incidents prompted disgust and fear. Positive societal impacts from accidents improved emotions but did not significantly affect travel attitudes. Negative emotions led to a notable shift in attitudes toward air travel, while positive emotions had a limited effect. Conclusions: The study provides valuable insights into the emotional dynamics following aviation accidents, enhancing the understanding of the emotion-social information model. It highlights the lasting impact of negative emotions on travel attitudes and the limited influence of positive emotions, with implications for psychological interventions and crisis management. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

In fields like aviation, established methods like SAGAT are used as state of the art for assessing SA, whereas in AD, there is less consensus on the most valid measures. In a driving simulator study with N = 41 participants, four different levels of SA were experimentally created by manipulating visual attention during AD. Different methods for assessing SA were logged during AD-mode and during takeover situations including subjective ratings, gaze behaviour, performance and probe measures. The impact of the manipulation of visual attention during AD mode on the different measures of SA as well as their relation to each other is analysed, reported and discussed. Results show pronounced differences between levels of attention during AD-mode in subjective SA, gaze behaviour and performance measures while preventing visual processing of the driving scenery completely while during AD mode caused surprisingly little impact. A relation between measures of SA and performance can be shown for specifically designed takeover scenarios with increased demands on SA. On the one hand, this implies that there can be a critical impact of SA on performance in takeover situations but it also highlights the robustness and efficiency of drivers’ visual processing that enables safe takeover responses even in situations with only little visual processing before a takeover. The implications of the results for assessing SA as well as the processes behind SA in AD are discussed. © 2025"

In the aviation domain, the two different roles of crews in the cockpit—pilot flying (PF) versus pilot monitoring (PM)—are responsible for different tasks. However, little is known about how role assignment shapes pilots’ perceived risk. We designed a flight-simulation experiment where 57 professional pilots completed two counterbalanced approaches under different role assignments with the assistance of a flight instructor in a full flight simulator. Their perceived risks were measured by psychophysiological responses and compared between the two different cockpit roles. Results indicate that participants exhibited stronger psychophysiological responses (e.g., higher subjective ratings, skin conductance responses, heart rates, and inter-beat intervals) when they served as PF than PM. Particularly, they reported higher scores in affect, susceptibility, and severity dimensions as PF than PM. The asymmetrically psychophysiological responses between the two varying roles in the cockpit emphasize the importance of controllability in shaping the pilot's perceived risk. Theoretically, our findings contribute to the existing literature on pilots’ perceived risk. Practically, we pave the way for engaging specific interventions and training for improving crew performance and flight safety. © 2025 Society for Risk Analysis."

With expansion comes challenges for the design of automation to support decision making. This research takes the perceptual cycle model (PCM) and the derived trust version of the Schema World Action Research Method (T-SWARM), to identify the issues and challenges of pilot intervention in UAVs operating during highly automated states. Nine UAV pilots with current experience operating medium to large UAVs were interviewed, using T-SWARM, about incidents in which they initiated an intervention in system operation (i.e. to avoid weather or collision) and an event where the system initiated the intervention (i.e. due to system failure). The coded responses highlighted the challenges with what information is displayed, how it is displayed and how it influences decision-making in the UAV context. In addition, the responses also identified aspects that influence trust in the system, including personal disposition, affect interventions with the automation. Against each of the key factors identified recommendations are made to increase safety and operational efficiency of UAV operations. This research adds to the growing body of literature that supports the application of T-SWARM for eliciting knowledge in the aviation domain and specifically within the UAV domain. © 2016"

Drawing on Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory, we test a model using data collected in 2024 from 293 employees at an international airport in Cyprus. Structural equation modeling reveals that resilience significantly enhances both grit and all three HAW dimensions. Among them, affective commitment emerged as a key mediator linking resilience to grit, while job satisfaction showed a surprising negative effect on grit. These findings highlight the importance of fostering eudaimonic rather than purely hedonic well-being to build sustainable motivation in emotionally demanding roles. Our results contribute to the sustainable work and well-being literature by positioning resilience and commitment as psychological resources that support organizational adaptability and long-term employee performance.

With respect to academics after SRC, the current systematic review evaluated 3 outcome measures in each included study: 1) RTL definition, 2) RTL duration, and 3) factors associated with longer RTL. METHODS Studies published before December 2022 that addressed RTL after an SRC were identified via a compressive literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Educational Resources Information Center, Ovid MEDLINE, and PubMed databases. Studies solely examining nonsport-related concussion/traumatic brain injury studies were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Criteria and the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for risk of bias. For each study included, the design, participants, interventions, outcomes, results, and conclusions were extracted. RESULTS Of 1838 studies identified, 21 met the inclusion criteria. These studies represented 8475 athletes (aged 5–27 years) who sustained an SRC. A total of 17/21 (81%) provided an RTL definition. Of the studies that defined RTL as any RTL, the median (range) was 5 (2.5–35.3) days, while the median (range) of those that defined RTL as full RTL without accommodations was 17.5 (3–49) days. Female gender (7/9 studies) and initial symptom severity (3/3 studies) were consistently associated with delayed RTL. Single studies identified anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and integrated performance management as potential factors for delayed RTL. Age (0/5 studies), concussion history (2/6), depression history (0/1), migraine history (0/2), learning disability (0/1), school type (public vs private) (0/2), and early air travel after SRC (0/1) did not appear to have consistent effects on RTL. CONCLUSIONS Across 21 primary studies, RTL definitions varied greatly, and similarly, a wide range of days to RTL was seen at 3–35 days. Female gender and initial symptom severity were most consistently associated with prolonged RTL. Certain factors such as a history of ADHD/anxiety showed potential effects but require further investigation. Management guidelines should consider these findings while recognizing the need for more comprehensive research to confirm and quantify the impact of various factors on RTL duration. ©AANS 2025, except where prohibited by US copyright law."

This study aimed to enhance understanding of airport accessibility by retrospectively analyzing reports from Autistic-led environmental assessments conducted at six Australian airports between 2017 and 2024. Drawing on an evidence-informed autism-friendly framework, the assessments focused on eight key elements, including sensory adaptations, communication supports, and preparation and predictability. Through reflexive thematic analysis, two key themes were generated: (1) navigating the sensory landscape and (2) help passengers navigate with confidence. Our findings underscore the importance of sensory adjustments—such as natural lighting and quiet spaces—alongside clearer visual aids and communication supports. Importantly, this study represents the first systematic application of autism-friendly principles to airport environments, offering practical, evidence-based recommendations for more inclusive design. By foregrounding the perspectives of Autistic individuals, this research highlights the need for participatory design approaches to create public spaces that are genuinely accessible and supportive for Autistic travelersLay abstractAirports can be challenging for Autistic people because of overwhelming sensory experiences like bright lights and loud noises, security processes, and crowded spaces. This study analyzed reports from six Australian airports, produced between 2017 and 2024, to understand how airports can be made better for Autistic travelers. These reports were based on assessments led by Autistic people and used a specific framework to evaluate areas like sensory experiences and communication needs. The study found two main ways to improve accessibility: (1) reducing sensory challenges, like loud noises or bright, overwhelming areas, and (2) improving communication and wayfinding to make navigation clearer and easier. Some of the recommendations included providing quiet spaces for travelers, using softer and more natural lighting, and improving signs to make it easier for people to navigate airports. This is the first study to apply autism-friendly principles to airports and shows the importance of involving Autistic people in the design of more inclusive public spaces. The findings offer practical recommendations for airports around the world to better support Autistic travelers. © The Author(s) 2025.

This study investigates the impact of Performance Management Systems (PMS) on employee attitudes within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) aviation industry. Specifically, it examines the mediating role of Employee Engagement (EE) and the moderating influence of Organizational Climate (OC), two factors that have been underexplored in the existing literature. Drawing on survey data from 349 aviation industry professionals in the UAE, the study employs Hayes Process Macro to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings reveal that PMS has a significant positive effect on employee attitudes, with EE emerging as a potent mediator. However, OC did not significantly moderate the relationship between PMS and attitude. These insights reveal that enhancing employee engagement through well-structured PMS can lead to more favourable work attitudes and improved organizational outcomes. The study not only bridges critical gaps in existing research but also offers evidence-based recommendations for HR practitioners.

"The Mental Health Symposium: An Effective Tool to Improve Collegiate Aviation Students’ Knowledge, Understanding, and Comfort with Mental Health","2025","Collegiate Aviation Review","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019517532&partnerID=40&md5=e0576f1dc9b92e436e66063689d9070c","Introduction: Mental health remains a pressing concern for many in the U.S. and has intensified for those in certain populations, especially students in primary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions. This concern is intensified for college-aged students and collegiate aviation students in particular, as they face a myriad of unique stressors. Despite societal embrace alongside awareness of mental health, many are still reluctant to seek help because of stigma and regulatory barriers, exacerbating risks to academic performance and aviation safety. Research Question: The central research question asks: What impact, if any, do Mental Health Symposiums have on the knowledge and understanding of mental health of collegiate aviation students? Data Collection and Analysis: A mixed methods design employing pre-and post-symposium surveys was administered to students attending the 2025 UNO Aviation Institute Mental Health Symposium in February 2025. Surveys included 40 questions (35 closed-ended, 5 open-ended); quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically via NVivo. A total of 68 paired responses were included in the final analysis to ultimately derive the findings/results. Findings/Results: Quantitative findings revealed significant increases in students’ knowledge and understanding of on-campus and industry-specific mental health resources. However, changes in comfort discussing mental health were less pronounced, indicating persistent interpersonal barriers. Thematic analysis identified five core themes: Education as Empowerment, Pathways to Awareness, Taboo to Conversation, Soaring Beyond Stigma, and Access Granted – Barriers Bypassed. Implications: This study highlights the effectiveness of mental health symposiums in increasing students’ awareness and understanding of mental health. Program leadership should consider sustained, multifaceted mental health interventions to foster a more supportive and stigma-free culture that is also sensitive to the gendered and first-generation student experiences. © 2025, University Aviation Association.

"Psychological resilience among emergency medical teams in Singapore","2025","Western Pacific Surveillance and Response Journal : WPSAR","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012563747&partnerID=40&md5=376f86ea5544937df7516279ceb0852a","Problem: Emergency medical teams (EMTs) responding to mass casualty incidents attend to casualties in a chaotic, high-pressure and resource-limited environment that is vastly different from their day-to-day work. The nature of mass casualty incidents and the work environment can impact psychological resilience, but the psychological resilience of members of EMTs has not been evaluated. Context: In Singapore, EMTs are deployed from public hospitals, polyclinics and the Singapore Red Cross to disaster sites, where they triage, stabilize and treat casualties before evacuating them to public hospitals for further management. Action: Twenty-four members of EMTs responded to a cross-sectional survey based on a psychological resilience tool developed for health-care rescuers involved in mass casualty incidents to evaluate their psychological resilience after a full-scale exercise involving an aviation accident. Respondents completed a psychological resilience tool that was developed by experts in disaster work and research using a modified Delphi approach. There were 27 items across eight domains: optimism, altruism, preparations for disaster rescue, social support, perceived control, self-efficacy, coping strategies and positive growth. Outcome: The key observations from the survey were that (i) staff demonstrated a strong sense of altruism and had good social support; (ii) staff were not confident about their preparedness, and this led to a lack of optimism, perceived control and ability to deal with emotions; and (iii) it was necessary for respondents to reflect on their experience to find meaning to support growth after the deployment. Discussion: Optimizing casualty survival and outcomes during mass casualty incidents requires not only excellent procedural training and robust standard operating procedures and work processes but also dedicated efforts to enhance the psychological resilience of members of EMTs. © 2025, World Health Organization.

It is unclear how pilot performance should be measured as automation increases. The objective of this work is to understand the variability in experimental methodology regarding how pilot performance is measured since the introduction of flight deck automation. There were 90 articles included in this scoping literature review. Less than half of the articles investigated pilot performance (~40%), about half of the articles investigated mental workload (~45%), and almost 70% of the articles collected psychophysiological data; however, only 20% of the articles investigated human–automation interaction despite automation increasing in the flight deck. Design of resilient systems that support the needs of the pilot require consideration of human-system dynamics. As aircraft systems become more autonomous, performance metrics are increasingly derived from the human operator, reflecting a shift towards human-centered evaluation. Thus, it becomes more important to understand and model the relationship between performance, mental workload, and psychophysiological data when humans work with automation. © 2025 by the authors."

Studies were included if they assessed cognitive states using physiological signals and applied machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques in practical task settings. The review highlights a pivotal shift from shallow ML to DL approaches for analysing physiological signals, driven by DL’s ability to autonomously learn complex patterns in large datasets. By 2023, DL has become the dominant methodology, though traditional ML techniques remain relevant. Additionally, there has been a move from neuroimaging to multimodal physiological modalities, with the decrease in neuroimaging use reflecting a trend towards integrating various physiological signals for more comprehensive insights. Cognitive state recognition is applied across diverse domains such as the automotive, aviation, maritime, and healthcare industries, enhancing performance and safety in high-stakes environments. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most utilised modality, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being the primary DL approach. The trend in cognitive state recognition research is moving towards integrating ECG signals with CNNs and adopting privacy-preserving methodologies like differential privacy and federated learning, highlighting the potential of cognitive state recognition to enhance performance, safety, and innovation across various real-world applications. © 2025 by the authors."

In order to reveal the relationship between the cockpit noise sound pressure level and pilot physiological indicators, and provide a scientific basis for cockpit noise airworthiness standards, this experiment takes pilot trainees as the research subject. Based on the principle of multimodal data synchronization, a sound field reconstruction system is used to reconstruct the cockpit sound field. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements are carried out in different sound pressure level noise operating environments. The results show that with the increase in the sound pressure level, the significant suppression of α-wave activity in the occipital and parietal regions suggests that the cortical resting state is lifted and visual attention is enhanced; the enhancement of the β-wave in the frontal regions reflects the enhancement of alertness and prefrontal executive control, and the suppression of θ-wave activity in the frontal and temporal regions may indicate that cognitive tuning is suppressed, which reflects the brain’s rapid adaptive response to external noise stimuli in a high-noise environment; noise exposure triggers sustained sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, which is manifested by a significant acceleration of the heart rate and a significant increase in the mean value of skin conductance when the noise sound pressure level exceeds 70 dB(A). The correlation analysis between physiological indicators shows that cockpit noise has a multi-system synergistic effect on human physiological indicators. The experimental results indicate that noise has a significant impact on EEG, ECG, and EDA indicators. © 2025 by the authors."

This study introduces a data-driven psychophysiological model, utilizing machine learning algorithms, to evaluate pilots' mental workload. We conducted a flight-simulation experiment involving twenty commercial airline pilots, assessing their mental workload under varying levels of task demand and visibility conditions. Psychophysiological responses were recorded, and machine learning algorithms were employed to analyze the data. To evaluate model performance, we used a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method and calculated area under the curve values. Our findings indicate that psychophysiological metrics vary in their sensitivity to changes in pilots' mental workload. Notably, the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm demonstrated the highest classification performance under high-visibility conditions, while the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm excelled under low-visibility conditions. These results suggest pilots' mental workload can be effectively identified through psychophysiological metrics combined with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, visibility conditions may influence the model's classification performance. This model offers a complementary approach to the subjective evaluation currently used by flight instructors to assess pilots' mental workload management capabilities during flight training and certification. It also provides a data-driven tool aligned with evidence-based training principles, enhancing the evaluation of pilots' mental workload management capabilities in flight scenarios. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

However, few studies have examined the mechanism by which pilots’ impulsivity affects flight accidents and incidents. The primary objective of this study is to combine a social-cognition approach with a personality approach to investigate the relationships among impulsivity, risk perception, situation awareness, and incident involvement in Chinese airline pilots. The study sample consisted of 520 commercial airline pilots from China Southern Airlines Ltd. A serial mediation model was constructed and tested using SPSS 26.0 and Mplus 7.0. The results indicate a significant positive correlation between impulsivity and incident involvement; impulsivity was also found to influence incident involvement through the mediating effects of risk perception and situation awareness. Specifically, three mediation pathways were identified: (1) the independent mediating effect of risk perception, (2) the independent mediating effect of situation awareness, and (3) the serial mediating effect of risk perception and situation awareness. These results reveal that impulsivity affects risk perception and SA, which in turn affect accident involvement. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanism by which impulsivity affects flight safety, and offers guidance for aviation safety managers to develop pilot selection, training and intervention programs that can ultimately contribute to promoting flight safety. © 2025"

[Methods]This study constructs a four-dimensional geographic public opinion hypernetwork model, incorporating ""City-Social-Opinion-Psychology"", based on a specific aviation accident. It employs methods such as complex networks, GIS spatial analysis, and machine learning to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of geographic public opinion. Additionally, the MRQAP model is used to investigate the driving mechanisms behind the spatial evolution of geographic public opinion. [Results]The empirical findings of this study indicate that: ① The spatial distribution of public opinion hotspots in China demonstrates significant geographical clustering and spatial correlation. These hotspots are predominantly concentrated in urban clusters south of the Hu Huanyong Line, including the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Shandong Peninsula, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing region, particularly in cities with strong information dissemination capabilities and substantial public influence. The clustering effect is more pronounced during the outbreak and persistence phases. ② The social subnet exhibits a diamond-shaped structure with a marked community effect, though its connectivity efficiency is relatively low. The mainstream emotions within the psychological subnet show a clear trend toward non-negative transformation. Topics within the opinion subnet show a decentralized evolutionary pattern. The city subnet displays a clear ""point-axis"" structure with a high degree of integration, reflecting high network dissemination efficiency. ③ Homophily, siphoning, and proximity effects all contribute to the spatial dissemination of public opinion. Social, psychological, and opinion similarities, coupled with a favorable educational environment, outward-oriented development model, superior media infrastructure, and institutional, social, and organizational proximity, facilitate the spatial diffusion of public opinion information.

While simulation-based medical education approaches are increasingly adopted to facilitate skills development in a safe, standardized and realistic manner, mental imagery (MI) has been considered as an emerging approach for surgical skills development. MI is defined as the mental rehearsal of tasks without motor performance and has demonstrated effective skills development in industries such as elite sport and aviation. However, its benefit has yet to be explored and utilized in the medical school curriculum. This scoping review seeks to evaluate the current literature to characterize efficacy of MI interventions for the surgical skills development of medical students. Methods: A scoping review was performed following a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Emcare databases. Articles evaluating the outcomes related to the impact of MI interventions on the development of technical and nontechnical surgical skills among medical students were included. Results: MI-based programs among medical students improve certain areas of technical and nontechnical surgical skills performance such as in laparoscopic performance, fluidity and with co-benefits of improved stress management and low cost. However, inconsistencies were observed in findings across studies, with mixed results across the technical and nontechnical surgical skills assessed. This was largely attributed to significant study heterogeneity of the underlying evidence. Conclusions: Despite the emerging evidence suggesting MI-based programs as an effective adjunct to the current surgical skills development, there are important limitations to the quality of the evidence. Our scoping review highlights the need for prospective research with standardized MI programs assessing surgical skills at the expected scope of competency for medical students to further characterize the utility of MI-based programs in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) surgical skills curriculum, particularly in areas of medical knowledge, professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills. © 2025 Association of Program Directors in Surgery"

One of the strategies to improve pilots' ability to deal with SD is to perform SD training using Virtual Reality and Motion Simulator (VRMS) system. However, there is still a lack of studies that investigated the application of VRMS for SD training. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop and validate VRMS-based SD scenarios. Twenty-two male Air Force fighter pilots (11 in the low experienced group and 11 in the high experienced group) participated in a controlled experiment in which they performed the flight task under two conditions (SD flight, non-SD flight), wherein the SD flight condition included the induction of four distinct SD illusions. Findings showed that the developed SD scenarios in the VRMS system effectively induce SD. More specifically, there were differences in the influence of flight experience and SD condition on pilots' flight performance and workload. This study suggests that the VRMS system can demonstrate several types of SD scenarios effectively and has a huge potential to be utilized as an SD training tool to improve overall flight safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the way primary flight instruments are monitored by pilots may be negatively affected by the high confidence in systems. We examined the effects of automation level on mental workload, manual flight performance and visual strategies. Twenty professional pilots performed six landing scenarios at three levels of automation depending on flight director (flight path guidance) and autothrust (automatic management of the speed) engagements. Higher levels of automation increased flight performance and reduced mental workload, but were associated with a decrease in vigilance to primary instruments, particularly flight path indicators and engines’ thrust. We also found that gaze entropy was sensitive to pilot role (pilot flying vs pilot monitoring) and automation level.

"Expert consensus on aeromedical identification of vasogenic white matter hyperintensities in aircrews; 飞行人员血管源性脑白质高信号航空医学鉴定专家共识","2025","Medical Journal of Chinese People's Liberation Army","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007978111&partnerID=40&md5=fe2860f09672009b95d56d8b8ff62934","White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are abnormal high-signal manifestations in white matter areas on magnetic resonance T<inf>2</inf>-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, with vasogenic WMH being the most common. Its pathological mechanism is related to cerebrovascular lesions and can lead to multi-dimensional brain functional impairments in cognition, movement, and emotions. Due to their unique working conditions, aircrews are more prone to vasogenic WMH than the general population. Moreover, with the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging in cranial disease screening for aircrews, the detection rate of vasogenic WMH in aircrews has significantly increased. However, to date, no national or academic organization has issued standardized aviation medical assessment criteria for vasogenic WMH in aircrews. Therefore, led by Xijing Hospital of Air Force Medical University and the Chinese PLA General Hospital, a multi-disciplinary expert panel involved in aviation medicine, neurology, radiology, psychology, and related fields was assembled to formulate this consensus. The document integrates evidence from a systematic review of PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang Data, and VIP databases, incorporates existing WMH guidelines, and synthesizes clinical expertise from Chinese specialists. The consensus outlines three key domains: target population, neuroimaging protocols for vasogenic WMH screening, and clinical assessment and aeromedical identification for aircrews with vasogenic WMH. The aim is to provide evidence-based support and expert recommendations for standardizing and improving the accuracy of aviation medical evaluations of vasogenic WMH in aircrews. © 2025 People's Military Medical Press.

"Forest biodiversity and structure modulate human health benefits and risks","2025","Nature Sustainability","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005533244&partnerID=40&md5=59885d7a03ea447d9af6b62d7e8cb2cb","The benefits and risks of forests to human health are widely recognized. Yet, variation across forest types and their ecological characteristics driving health effects remain underexplored. Based on a continental-scale, interdisciplinary empirical database from 164 European forest stands, we constructed a Bayesian Belief Network to quantify seven causal pathways relating distinct forest types to physical and mental health. These forest–health pathways included mental well-being via visual or auditory stimuli, thermal comfort, polyphenol content of medicinal plants, mushrooms and nutrition, air quality, and ticks and Lyme disease. Results show that forests consistently provide net health benefits regardless of their ecological characteristics. Forest canopy density and tree species diversity emerge as key drivers, but their effect size and directionality are strongly pathway-dependent. Changes in forest canopy density can generate trade-offs. For example, forests optimized for heat buffering and air pollution mitigation may compromise medicinal plant yield and enhance Lyme disease prevalence. Tree diversity effects were weaker but more uniformly positive. Therefore, forest management should account for such trade-offs to tailor forest biodiversity and functioning to local public health priorities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025."
"Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale (WEMWBS) – a validity and reliability study in the civil aviation sector in Turkey","2025","Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003283772&partnerID=40&md5=f88e0721bf3e168f3a6b528314c4a64a","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to test the psychometric properties of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS), which expresses an individual’s life satisfaction, motivation and happiness level, in a sample of Civil Aviation sector employees in Turkey. Another aim of the research is that the measurement tool can be applied in the aviation sector, which has an essential place in accidents and crashes. Design/methodology/approach: In the adaptation phase of the WEMWBS, the statements were evaluated by experts using the translation and retranslation technique. Then, a pilot study was conducted with 30 people, and the final version was given to the scale. With the purposive sampling method, data were obtained online from two study groups between the ages of 20 and 60 (1st group: n = 210, 2nd group: n = 327). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, Cronbach’s alpha reliability, composite reliability (CR) and average explained variance (AVE) values and criterion-related validity of the WEMWBS adaptation were analyzed using SPSS 24 and AMOS 27 programs. Findings: The WEMWBS exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure. The factors explained 62.936% of the total variance. The factor structure was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, CR, GFI, NFI, RFI, IFI, TLI and CFI values above 0.90 and acceptable RMR below 0.05 indicate good fit. To test the criterion-related validity of the WEMWBS, significant relationships were found with the Oxford scales of happiness (p < 0.01; 0.498), happiness at work (p < 0.01; 0.518), perceived stress (p < 0.01; −0.392) and self-esteem (p < 0.01; 0.366), and criterion-related validity was ensured. Cronbach’s alpha 0.921, CR and AVE values were found to be acceptable values, and convergent validity was achieved. As a result, the 2-dimensional structure of the scale was validated in the aviation sector sample. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations. First, the research is a cross-sectional study conducted in the aviation sector. The data were obtained from individuals working in Istanbul. Therefore, the generalization of the results obtained for the entire aviation sector is limited. In addition, the responses given by employees working in the sector where the surveys were collected may be biased. The data were collected using a survey method, and the researcher has no control over the research environment. Another study limitation is that individuals responded to the survey questions according to their perceptions. Practical implications: The two-factor structure of the WEMWBS scale was validated in the aviation sample. Social implications: The validation of WEMWBS in the field of organizational psychology and working individuals is expected to investigate the relationship of mental well-being of individuals with other variables in the organizational sense and to be beneficial to organizational outcomes and society. Originality/value: The present study makes an important contribution to the field of organizational psychology and management by adapting the original version of WEMWBS from the service sector to the civil aviation sector sample in Turkey. In addition, the findings show that this scale has psychometric properties, is valid and reliable and can be used as a measurement tool to measure the mental well-being of working individuals. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Review of heart rate variability parameter estimation methods in facial video; 人脸视频中心率变异性参数估计方法综述","2025","Journal of Image and Graphics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005439693&partnerID=40&md5=b35b33445ace776b11b44f59b5e5b6cf","Heart rate variability(HRV)analysis has emerged as a powerful tool in health monitoring and disease diagnosis, offering valuable insights into the autonomic nervous system’s regulation of the cardiovascular system. Estimating HRV from facial video is an innovative approach that combines convenience and non-invasiveness, which holds great promise for advancing personalized healthcare. This method utilizes facial video to capture subtle changes in skin color caused by blood flow variations, allowing for remote and continuous monitoring of heart rate dynamics. HRV reflects the variations in the time intervals, known as RR intervals, between successive heartbeats. It serves as a non-invasive marker of cardiac autonomic function and provides a dynamic assessment of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. The significance of HRV lies in its ability to reveal underlying physiological conditions that may not be immediately apparent through standard vital sign measurements. For instance, a reduced HRV can indicate stress, fatigue, or the early onset of cardiovascular disease, making it a valuable metric for both preventive and therapeutic health strategies. The key parameters in HRV analysis include both time-domain and frequency-domain metrics. Time-domain measures, such as the standard deviation of NN intervals and the root mean square of successive differences, provide insights into overall heart rate dynamics and short-term variability. Frequency-domain measures, such as low-frequency and high-frequency components and their ratio, help evaluate the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. These parameters are vital for assessing individual health, particularly in relation to cardiovascular conditions, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system disorders. In healthcare, HRV has a wide range of applications across various domains. In disease prevention, HRV analysis can detect early signs of cardiovascular issues by identifying deviations from normal HRV patterns, potentially indicating autonomic dysfunction or underlying heart conditions. For example, individuals with lower HRV may be at a higher risk of sudden cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Continuous monitoring of HRV can therefore serve as a predictive marker for these events, enabling earlier interventions that could save lives. During rehabilitation, HRV monitoring assists in tracking recovery progress and adjusting treatment plans. Changes in HRV can guide modifications in exercise regimens, physiotherapy, or medication dosages, offering a more personalized approach to patient care and optimizing recovery outcomes. HRV also plays a crucial role in mental health, emotional management, and stress monitoring. Analyzing HRV allows healthcare providers to better understand a patient’s stress levels, emotional state, and overall cardiovascular health, enabling more tailored and effective treatment strategies. Facial video acquisition and data preprocessing are critical steps in HRV estimation. Obtaining high-quality RGB image data requires video capture devices with appropriate resolution and frame rate. Stable and consistent video capture conditions are essential to ensure accurate HRV estimation. Technical requirements for video frame extraction include precise synchronization and alignment of frames to maintain consistency across analyses. Data cleaning and normalization processes involve removing artifacts, correcting for illumination variations, and standardizing the data for analysis. Effective preprocessing ensures that the facial video accurately reflects the physiological signals needed for HRV estimation. Various methods are used for HRV parameter estimation. Traditional signal processing techniques, such as blind source separation and skin model-based methods, have been employed for years. Blind source separation aims to isolate the desired physiological signal from noise and interference, while skin model-based methods leverage physiological models to estimate heart rate from subtle changes in facial color due to blood flow variations. Frequency-domain analysis decomposes the HRV signal into its frequency components to assess autonomic function, while time-frequency analysis provides a comprehensive view of HRV dynamics by combining time and frequency information. Emerging deep learning algorithms have shown great promise in HRV estimation from facial videos. Supervised convolutional neural networks can learn complex features from labeled data, enhancing the ability to extract relevant information from facial videos. Recurrent neural networks are effective for modeling temporal dependencies in sequential data, which is particularly useful for HRV estimation where time-series analysis is critical. Transformer models, known for their capacity to handle long-range dependencies and capture intricate patterns, offer further advantages in this domain. Although less commonly used for HRV estimation, unsupervised generative adversarial networks provide potential for generating synthetic data to augment training datasets, improving model robustness and reducing the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets. The performance of traditional and deep learning methods varies across different application scenarios. Traditional methods often perform well in controlled environments but may struggle with complex scenes or dynamic changes, such as varying lighting conditions or head movements. On the other hand, deep learning methods, while more adept at handling complex and noisy data, require large amounts of labeled training data and significant computational resources. This trade-off highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach and underscores the importance of selecting appropriate methods based on specific application needs. Facial video-based HRV estimation has several practical applications. In health assessment, continuous HRV monitoring can provide real-time insights into a patient’s health status, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment adjustments. Emotional recognition involves analyzing facial expressions and HRV to understand emotional states, which can be particularly useful in mental health diagnostics and therapy. Mental stress evaluation uses HRV data to identify individuals at risk of stress-related conditions, which is crucial for preventing burnout and promoting workplace well-being. Fatigue detection is vital for ensuring safety in various professional settings, such as aviation, transportation, and healthcare, where fatigue-related errors could have serious consequences. Early warning of cardiovascular diseases can be achieved through HRV monitoring, providing early alerts for potential health issues and enabling preventative measures. Despite the progress made in facial video-based HRV estimation, there are still challenges to overcome. Subject head movements and different lighting conditions can affect estimation accuracy, making it essential to develop robust algorithms that can handle these variations. Model selection and training strategies need to be optimized to improve performance in diverse real-world scenarios. Enhancing the real-time performance and robustness of these algorithms is crucial for their practical application, particularly in wearable and mobile health monitoring devices. Reducing dependency on large-scale labeled datasets through semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches could make these technologies more accessible and scalable, expanding their use in both clinical and consumer health settings. In conclusion, facial video-based HRV estimation technology holds great promise for health monitoring and disease diagnosis. By addressing current challenges and exploring future research directions, this technology can be further refined and integrated into everyday health practices. The ability to estimate HRV non-invasively from facial video has the potential to revolutionize the field of telemedicine and personalized health, offering a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible tool for continuous health monitoring. As research progresses, this innovative approach may become a standard component of modern healthcare, providing valuable insights into individual health status and enhancing overall quality of life. © 2025 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

Objective: To assess whether a pre-induction safety checklist completed by veterinary students during a spay/neuter laboratory minimized the number of incomplete pre-induction tasks. Participants and procedure: Third-year veterinary students (N = 53) managed the anesthesia of dogs and cats admitted for spay/neuter surgery under supervision. The use of a pre-induction checklist was mandatory to ensure appropriate preparation before anesthesia induction. Differences in checklist completeness between the 1st and 2nd wk of the spay/neuter laboratory were compared using Fisher's exact test. Results: Over 2 wk, 83 anesthesia procedures were completed. Use of the pre-induction checklist identified at least 1 omitted pre-induction task in 67.5% (56/83) of anesthesia procedures. The number of incomplete pre-induction tasks identified through use of the checklist decreased significantly from the 1st (82.9%, 34/41) to the 2nd (52.4%, 22/42) wk (odds ratio: 4.4, 95% CI: 1.7 to 11; P = 0.0046). The most frequently missed item was premeasuring the endotracheal tube insertion depth (42.2%, 35/83), followed by failure to leak-test the endotracheal tube cuffs and not having gauze available (15.7%, 13/83 for each). Finally, the checklist identified closed adjustable pressure-limiting valves in 4.8% (4/83) of cases. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The pre-induction checklist was effective in ensuring that veterinary students completed relevant pre-induction tasks during a spay/neuter laboratory.

"The Sustained Attention Paradox: A Critical Commentary on the Theoretical Impossibility of Perfect Vigilance","2025","Cognitive Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002113685&partnerID=40&md5=efd12439e4164cf9fb4b80dea76dfa02","The human capacity for sustained attention represents a critical cognitive paradox: while essential for numerous high-stakes tasks, perfect vigilance is fundamentally impossible. This commentary explores the theoretical impossibility of maintaining uninterrupted attention, drawing from extensive interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology. Multiple converging lines of evidence demonstrate that sustained attention is constrained by neural, biological, and cognitive limitations. Neural mechanisms reveal that attention operates through rhythmic oscillations, with inherent fluctuations in frontoparietal networks and default mode network interactions. Neurochemical systems and cellular adaptation effects further underscore the impossibility of continuous, perfect vigilance. Empirical research across domains—including aviation, healthcare, industrial safety, and security—consistently demonstrates rapid declines in attention performance over time, regardless of individual expertise or motivation. Even elite performers like military personnel and experienced meditators exhibit inevitable attention lapses. This paper presents an argument against traditional approaches that seek to overcome these limitations through training or willpower. Instead, it advocates for designing human–technology systems that work harmoniously with cognitive constraints. This requires developing adaptive automation, understanding individual and cultural attention variations, and creating frameworks that strategically balance human capabilities with technological support. © 2025 The Author(s).

The authors advocate for a response capability that is rooted in the foundational principles that make each organization successful yet unique, applying the lessons that the past can teach us about the future. The paper draws inspiration from three seminal books published in the late 1970s and early 1980s, reflecting on the enduring relevance of their insights in the present. The authors focus on Classics in Organization Behavior, Classics in Organization Theory, and Classics of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. The central narrative centers around the case study of GE Aviation (formerly GE Aircraft Engines) facility in Bromont, Quebec, Canada, a maverick organization which has thrived for over 40 years as a self-organizing workplace. The socio-technical perspective applied at Bromont originated from the work at the Tavistock Institute in the 1950s, challenging the prevailing technological imperative in favor of a more holistic approach that considers people as integral to the system, rather than expendable spare parts. The paper details Bromont's evolution, success factors, and challenges, emphasizing the importance of continuous adaptation, employee involvement, and a flat organizational structure. The authors derive key lessons from Bromont, including the significance of leadership support, rigorous hiring processes, the benefits of smaller organizational sizes, the role of managers as enablers, and the need for a unique, contextualized approach rather than blindly copying models. The paper concludes by advocating for the ongoing optimization of socio-technical systems, aligning growth and learning within a flat organizational structure, and maintaining a balance between new business strategies and foundational principles. © Organizational Design Community 2024."

"A Theoretical Model to Understand Flight Instructors’ Safety Behaviors in the United States: Through Personality Traits, Self-Efficacy, Risk Perception, and Safety Climate","2025","Collegiate Aviation Review","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001960578&partnerID=40&md5=36f5067d945872dc21cafcc6c7725f6e","Safety is an important aspect for any organization or individual to be successful, and the field of aviation has no exceptions. A CFI is authorized to give training and endorsements required for student, private, commercial, and instrument pilot certificates. CFIs play a very critical role in the success of pilot-in-training students at flight schools (Osman et al., 2022). According to AOPA (2015), the two greatest risks in flight training are loss of control inflight (LOC) and midair collisions. Moreover, approximately 71% of the accidents in which a CFI was involved happened during takeoff/climb, low-altitude maneuvers, and Instrumental Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The probable cause of LOC and midair collisions was due to poor decision-making, bad judgment, and unsafe behaviors of the CFIs (AOPA, 2015). In psychological aviation research, various perspectives, such as those associated with social cognition and personality, have attempted to explain individual differences in risky behaviors and accident involvement (Ji et al., 2011). The purpose of the present study was to build a theoretical model that demonstrates the relationship between personality traits, self-efficacy, risk-perception, safety climate, and safety behaviors of CFIs. A literature review was conducted to identify the existing relationships between the target constructs used in the study and the safety behaviors among workers across various aviation and non-aviation work settings. Over 100 abstracts were reviewed for relevancy, and 43 articles published between 1990 and 2020 were selected for full review. Of the 43 articles selected, only 30 articles were thoroughly reviewed and used to extract information. The results indicated the proposed theoretical model: (a) CFIs’ personality traits as measured by CFIs levels of Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness will directly influence their safety behaviors; (b) CFIs’ self-efficacy and risk-perception named as affective domain variables will have a direct influence on their safety behaviors; (c) CFIs’ safety climate will directly influence their safety behaviors; (d) CFIs’ self-efficacy and risk-perception will mediate the relationship between CFIs’ personality traits and safety behaviors; and (e) Flight school’s safety climate, will moderate the relationship between CFIs’ personality traits and their safety behaviors.

"Real-time assessment of triage nurse situational awareness (SA) using the situation awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT)","2025","PLOS ONE","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218116258&partnerID=40&md5=93418ea166d0ed92964a29ecc8802bc3","Background The emergency department (ED) is a complex, unpredictable, and distraction-filled environment. Within these challenging conditions, triage nurses are tasked with quickly assessing, identifying, and prioritizing patients who require urgent interventions. Studies from other safety-critical fields, such as aviation and the military, have highlighted that situational awareness (SA) is a critical skill for optimizing human performance during time-sensitive situations. In these fields, limitations in SA have been identified as significant risks to safety. However, despite its importance, SA in the context of EDs has been largely overlooked. Endsley’s SA theory and the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) provide a framework to evaluate SA in dynamic and complex workspaces. This study aims to assess SA during real-time triage processes of patients in EDs, utilizing Endsley’s SA model. Method An observational cross-sectional study was conducted to assess SA. Forty real-time triaging processes were observed and evaluated in two ED sites, using the SAGAT to measure SA levels. Results A total of 40 triage nurses participated in the study across two ED sites. The findings revealed that the perception of patient cues was significantly reduced by workload (p = 0.048) and stress (p = 0.025), while playing video games was associated with enhanced perception of patient cues (p = 0.014). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between the perception of patient cues and comprehension, indicating a cognitive trade-off between these two SA levels. Only 10% (n = 4) of participants achieved a good SA score, emphasizing the need for improvement. Conclusion The results underscore the importance of understanding and improving situational awareness in triage nurses using Endsley’s SA model. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing future practice, education, and research focused on optimizing situational awareness in emergency nursing. © 2025 Alfuraydi, Al-Moteri.

This paper investigates the electric shuttle buses and towing tractors cooperative scheduling considering workload balance optimization problem (e-STCSWB). We introduce a mixed integer programming formulation for e-STCSWB that considers cooperative relationships, workload balance, energy consumption and time windows to minimize total energy consumption costs. The e-STCSWB is obtained small scale exact solutions using the CPLEX solver. Furthermore, a column generation approach is developed, which is enhanced through a problem-specific strategy. Extensive computational results using real-world instances from one of China's largest airports show that it can obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions. The problem-specific strategy significantly improves the performance in terms of solution quality and solution time. Finally, we perform sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the impact under different numbers of vehicles and workload balance requirements parameter settings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We used an exploratory approach to examine whether there are personality-related differences in who completes the Swedish military pilot education. Assessment records of 182 applicants, accepted to the education between the years of 2004 and 2020 were studied (Mean age 24, SD 4.2 96% men, 4% women). Discriminant analysis was used to explore which personality traits and suitability ratings might be related to education completion. Analysis included suitability assessments made by senior pilots and by a psychologist, a number of traits assessed by the same psychologist, as well as the Commander Trait Inventory (CTI). The resulting discriminant function was significant (Wilk's Lambda = 0.808, (20) = 32.817, p =.035) with a canonical correlation of 0.44. The model was able to classify 74.1% of sample cases correctly. The modeling suggests that senior pilot assessment and psychologist assessment both predict education completion. Also contributing were the traits energy, professional motivation, study forecast and leader potential. © 2024 The Author(s).

Incident involvement among pilots has been a major human factor safety concern. Enhancing safety by reducing accidents and improving pilot behaviour is vital for aviation safety. Future time perspective (FTP) has been found to be a protective factor in safety behaviour. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of FTP on safe flight performance and the underlying mechanisms. Methods. The model was examined with 514 Chinese civil pilots; the participants completed measurements regarding FTP, vocational calling, perceived organizational support (POS) and incident involvement. Results. The correlation analyses indicated that FTP was significantly negatively associated with pilot incident involvement, and POS was significantly negatively associated with pilot incident involvement. Mediation analyses revealed that vocational calling partially mediated the link between FTP and pilot incident involvement. Moderated mediation further indicated that POS moderated the negative mediation path of FTP on pilot incident involvement. Conclusion.

Air traffic controllers should maintain high situational awareness (SA) and low cognitive workload to ensure aviation safety. However, increased task complexity may influence air traffic controllers’ SA and cognitive workload. Meanwhile, eye-tracking provides insights into the gaze patterns that might signify SA. This article investigates the gaze behaviours, SA and cognitive workload of different radar screen monitoring tasks with varying task complexity. Methods. Twenty-eight participants performed three radar screen monitoring tasks, including call-sign association, position identification and heading projection. Cognitive workload and SA were evaluated for each task using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) and situational awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT), respectively. The Gaussian mixture model was used to cluster the SA into high/low. Eye-tracking reveals the gaze behaviours that may contribute to the SA formation. Results. Cognitive workload and SA significantly differ between different levels of task complexity. While task complexity has a significant main effect on the fixations of human operators, it does not significantly influence the pupil diameter. Conclusions. Fixation-related metrics may signify the changes in SA under varying task complexity, while the side effects of cognitive workload should be mitigated. © 2025 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB)."

However traditional methods like linear models Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear temporal dependencies in EEG signals. These approaches typically fail to integrate multi-scale features effectively, resulting in suboptimal health intervention decisions, especially in dynamic, high-pressure environments like pilot training. Methods: To overcome these challenges, this study introduces PilotCareTrans Net, a novel Transformer-based model designed for health intervention decision-making in aviation students. The model incorporates dynamic attention mechanisms, temporal convolutional layers, and multi-scale feature integration, enabling it to capture intricate temporal dynamics in EEG data more effectively. PilotCareTrans Net was evaluated on multiple public EEG datasets, including MODA, STEW, SJTUEmotion EEG, and Sleep-EDF, where it outperformed state-of-the-art models in key metrics. Results and discussion: The experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to not only enhance prediction accuracy but also reduce computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications in resource-constrained settings. These findings indicate that PilotCareTrans Net holds significant potential for improving cognitive health monitoring and intervention strategies in aviation, thereby contributing to enhanced safety and performance in critical environments. © © 2025 Zhao and Guo."

Understanding solutions to pilot job burnout is crucial for addressing the aforementioned challenges. Cognitive reappraisal, a double-edged sword, has yet to be proven effective in its application to this specific population, and there is a lack of research explaining why cognitive reappraisal can reduce job burnout. This empirical study, collecting data from 106 pilots, reveals cognitive reappraisal’s efficacy in reducing burnout by lowering perceived stress (R2= 0.497). The reduction is modulated by pilots’ psychological resilience, indicating higher resilience enhances cognitive reappraisal’s effectiveness. Additionally, perceived stress mediates differently in emotional exhaustion compared to dehumanization or reduced personal accomplishment.

Evaluating the characteristics of students in aviation, including sensory experiences such as stress, decision-making, and pattern recognition, is important for safe flight. This study aims to investigate the cognitive and emotional impacts of face pareidolia among pilot students by using the digital Pareidolia Test (PT). METHODS: Subjects were 86 students from the Professional Pilot B.Sc. PROGRAM: PT includes 10 face and 10 pareidolia images. The number of European Aviation Safety Agency flight and simulator training hours, stress levels, and perceiving emotion in the pareidolia and face images were assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to test normality, and the Chi-squared test was used to analyze differences. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences in perceiving emotion in facial images based on stress levels from flight training from faculty courses (N = 42/86, 49.9%), and perceiving faces in pareidolia images related to flight simulator training hours. Perceiving emotions in pareidolia images varied significantly based on the number of European Aviation Safety Agency tests, but perceiving faces on pareidolia images did not show significant differences. DISCUSSION: We claim that incorporating pareidolia in aviation training enhances pilots' pattern recognition abilities, facilitating more accurate decision-making. The research recommends using the new digital PT in professions that require attention, such as pilots, to evaluate these parameters. Akdeniz G, Yilmaz HE, Geza H.

"Arterial Oxygen Desaturation Hinders Gamified Working Memory Performance","2025","Military Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216016990&partnerID=40&md5=e1bbe001ab3ed8e139019c8077085ab4","Introduction: Hypoxia presents a physiological challenge to the Warfighters during military aviation and subterranean warfare operations by decreasing the supply of oxygen to the brain, which results in a reduced cognitive function depending on the magnitude and duration of hypoxic exposure. Moderate hypoxic exposures, fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO<inf>2</inf>) of 0.11 to 0.14, show no effects on simple tasks, but complex tasks like working memory may be hindered. Unfortunately, people often cannot recognize their own symptoms of hypoxemia, which are individualistic at moderate hypoxic exposure. Thus, screening tools, like gamified cognitive assessments, during moderate hypoxia may provide personnel objective feedback to initiate safety protocols before a possible accident. However, whether gamified assessments of working memory are sensitive to moderate hypoxia is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis which moderate normobaric hypoxia decreases gamified working memory performance when accounting for the individualistic responses of arterial blood oxygen saturations. Materials and methods: Following 3 consecutive days of 2 practice sessions per day, 30 healthy adults (25 ± 5 years, 10 women) completed three 1-min rounds of the tablet-based working memory game (Backtracker, Statespace Labs, Inc.) at baseline and 60 and 90 min after exposure to FiO<inf>2</inf> (= 0.138 ± 0.002 [hypoxia] and 0.201± 0.004 [normoxia] oxygen). Both conditions were completed on the same day and administered in a single-blind, block randomized manner. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was estimated via forehead pulse oximetry (S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). Data were analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling. Results: Compared to normoxia (99 ± 1%), S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was lower (P <. 001) at 60 (90 ± 2%) and 90 (90 ± 2%) min of hypoxia. A decrease in S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of both tiles with the correct location (P <. 02; -0.016) and correct order of appearance recalled (P <. 01; -0.016). A decrease in S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was associated with a statistically significant decrease in median time to first tap (P <. 01; -0.041 s) and median time between taps (P <. 01; -0.030 s). A significant interaction effect between the S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decrease and baseline performance was found for proportion of tiles with the correct location recalled (P <. 05; -0.014), median time to first tap (P <. 01; -0.070 s), and median time between taps (P <. 01; -0.037 s). A significant interaction effect between the S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decrease and the path length was found for the proportion of tiles with the correct location recalled (P <. 01; +0.021), median time to first tap (P <. 01; -0.036 s), and median time between taps (P <. 01; -0.043 s). Conclusions: These findings indicate that greater decreases in S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf> during moderate hypoxic exposure hinder performance on a gamified assessment of working memory as measured by the proportion of correctly identified order and location of tiles. Considering the statistically significant decrease in both median time to first tap and median time between taps associated with the decrease in S<inf>p</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, participants are taking less time to plan or execute movements, which may compound or independently contribute to spatial and temporal memory mistakes. © 2024 The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

Additionally, we developed hypothetical scenarios for selected European cities as centroids for future conferences. Results: EHPS conferences with an online option result in significant reductions in CO<inf>2</inf>eq emissions when compared to on-site only conferences. The selected European locations of these conferences enable more delegates to choose alternative forms of transportation instead of flying, such as trains, cars or buses, and consequently lead to significantly lower CO<inf>2</inf>eq emissions.

"Is it safe to be safe? Examining underreporting and presenteeism among European pilots: The role of employment type","2025","Safety Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206928373&partnerID=40&md5=8c9393c800c305051248eb38a021d95b","Background: Atypical employment among pilots is a growing concern in the European aviation industry. Following deregulation, atypical forms of employment (e.g., being employed by subsidiaries or agencies, or on a temporary basis) have become more common, raising concerns about their implications for flight safety and pilots’ safety behaviors. It is suggested that pilots in such forms of employment experience greater job insecurity and will thus refrain from certain safety behaviors as it is more advantageous to their tenure. Method: This cross-sectional survey study aimed at examining deviations in safety behaviors, such as underreporting and presenteeism (attending work while ill), with regards to typically and atypically employed pilots (N = 4,546). Results: Pilots in atypical employment reported significantly higher frequencies of both presenteeism (47.5% vs. 31%) and underreporting (59.5% vs. 41.2%) when compared to their typically employed counterparts. Those atypically employed were more likely to cite fear of disciplinary action or dismissal as the reason for not adhering to safety practices. Underreporting and presenteeism were common, with organizational barriers, e.g., lack of feedback, being primary drivers, in line with previous research. Personal financial reasons were the most prevalent factor motivating presenteeism, regardless of employment type. Conclusion: The present study highlights the frequent occurrence of presenteeism and underreporting in the European aviation industry, highlighting a need for regulatory, organizational, and safety management attention to address these inclinations. While employment type is associated with these behaviors, further research is needed to understand better the mechanisms influencing pilots’ decisions to underreport and attend work in unfit states. © 2024 The Author(s)"

This study investigated whether flight time, cognitive reflection, task-load, metacognition, and perceived stress predicted decision-making (DM) performance during two in-flight training simulations with 104 commercial pilots at Bogota International Airport. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the predictors accounted for 56% of the variance. Cognitive reflection, flight time and performance task load emerged as significant positive predictors. Cognitive reflection significantly moderated the relationship between flight time and DM performance, with pilots scoring lower on cognitive reflection showing improved DM with increased flight time, while controlling for performance task load. The study did not find significant relationships between stress metacognition and DM performance. The study emphasises the significance of advanced training methods in improving pilots’ DM, especially for those with low cognitive reflection. Future research should expand to multiple airlines, address gender balance, and incorporate direct measures of metacognitive monitoring. © 2024 The Author(s).

A sample of 327 respondents was collected from 32 organizations in the aviation industry in the United Arab Emirates through purposive sampling. The hypothesized associations were analyzed via structural equation modelling. As predicted, proactive personality is a mediator, and organizational culture moderates the said relationships. Managers desirous of improving employees’ work engagement will now understand how employees’ curiosity can enhance work engagement through proactive personality. Managers can also ensure that organizational culture can further strengthen the relationship between curiosity and proactive personality. © The Author(s) 2022."

This article presents a case study of the planning and implementation of an integrated two-stage admission program that focused on selecting students based on academic rigor, preparedness, and aviation readiness. A diverse selection committee of both military and civilian flight training experts reviewed 493 applicants using a rubric-based examination of aviation experience and essay responses, while excluding standardized test scores and high school grade point averages (GPAs). In the process, student motivation, ability to perform well on the FAA written exam, and any prior aviation experience were highlighted while avoiding placing a competitive disadvantage on non-pilot applicants. The quality of the essays and the degree to which the candidate demonstrated dedication to aviation made more difference in a person's selection than licensure alone. The study concludes with recommendations for incorporating personality and grit assessments in future iterations to enhance predictive validity and reduce reviewer workload. © 2025."
"A new approach for prioritising personality traits causing pilot error","2025","International Journal of Sustainable Aviation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105025648249&partnerID=40&md5=c7dce62c33042bdcd6850e90b99989c7","Pilot personality traits are among the most critical risk factors contributing to human error in aviation. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines a risk assessment matrix and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to prioritise personality traits leading to pilot errors. The proposed framework first identifies unacceptable traits among commercial airline and military pilots and then uses AHP to calculate their relative importance. Findings reveal that for commercial pilots, a lack of self-discipline and rule-consciousness are the most critical traits, while for military pilots, a lack of self-discipline, absence of rule-consciousness, overconfidence, and neuroticism are the dominant traits. The proposed model offers a proactive and systematic method to evaluate pilot personality characteristics, supporting the development of more effective pilot selection and training systems to enhance flight safety. © © 2025 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

"Variations in mood states among Brazilian air force pilots: a crossover analysis between operational and aerobatic flight missions","2025","Frontiers in Physiology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105024097255&partnerID=40&md5=7c3e1b5e13bc081da04cca9c7dfd4113","Background: Aerobatic flight maneuvers expose military pilots to a confluence of physiological and psychological stressors—including sustained G-forces, vestibular disorientation, and neuromuscular fatigue—that may acutely modulate emotional states and compromise cognitive performance. However, the differential psychometric impact of routine operational flights versus high-intensity air demonstrations remains poorly characterized. Purpose: To examine and compare mood state fluctuations elicited by distinct aerial mission profiles—operational maintenance (OM) flights and aerobatic demonstrations (AD)—within a specialized military pilot cohort. Methods: In this within-subject, crossover experimental design, nine elite male aviators (mean age: 32.1 ± 1.8 years) from the Brazilian Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron (EDA), each with >1,000 cumulative flight hours, were assessed across two mission contexts. Mood states were measured pre- and post-flight using the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), which evaluates six psychological dimensions: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Paired comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Results: OM flights were associated with a statistically significant increase in depression scores post-flight (p = 0.031), alongside a non-significant trend toward decreased tension (p = 0.098). Other subscales showed no statistically significant variation, though intra-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Emotional reactivity among high-performance military pilots varies according to mission typology. Incorporating continuous affective monitoring and routine psychological assessments may bolster both operational readiness and mental health preservation in high-demand aviation environments. © © 2025 Santana, Pivetta, Da Silva, Campos, Farinatti, Almeida, Verame, Brandão and Figueira Junior."

When looking at safety from a cultural perspective, organizations are seen as cultures, with their own internal dynamics and ways of interacting with, and interpreting, the outside world. Looking at organizations from a cultural perspective improves our ability to lead and manage them by increasing our understanding of these internal dynamics shaping their behavior. This book offers a theoretically sound yet practical approach to organizational and cultural issues. It investigates their influence on safety and acknowledges the complexity and dynamic nature of today's organizations. The book is a comprehensive introduction to a cultural approach to safety. It explains the main principles in thinking about safety from a cultural perspective and provides the reader with tools for monitoring and developing culture for safety in organizations. Methods for developing a cultural approach to safety are introduced, and typical approaches to assessing culture for safety are critically reviewed. It draws on more than two decades of experience that the author has in the safety field as a researcher, consultant, and practitioner and includes practical examples, lessons learned, and research findings from several safety-critical fields, including the nuclear, healthcare, construction, petrochemical, and transportation sectors. The reader will develop a thorough overview towards developing their own cultural approach to safety through overviews of resilience and complexity thinking, organizational psychology, management sciences, leadership research, psychological safety, normalization, drift, decision making, leadership, and communication. Safety in Complex Organizations: A Cultural Approach is a fascinating read for professionals from any discipline who deal with hazards and safety issues, especially those in the nuclear industry; transportation industries, including aviation, rail, and maritime; petrochemical industries; the food industry; healthcare; mining; construction; and conventional and renewable power industries. © 2026 Teemu Reiman."

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach for emotion transition recognition using multimodal physiological signal fusion. Thirty participants, including 10 licensed pilots and 20 non-pilots controls, were recruited to view 48 video stimuli de-signed to elicit six distinct emotional transitions. We introduce a two-stage progressive recognition framework to enhance performance in emotional transition modeling. In Stage I, differential entropy features extracted from EEG signals are integrated with Big Five personality traits to construct an occupation-based trait classification model, capturing cognitive-emotional patterns associated with occupational background and providing individualized priors. In Stage II, we develop the temporal spatial embed ding bidirectional cross-attention fusion network (TSE-BCAF), which employs parallel convolutional modules to extract deep spatial features from multimodal EEG and EOG signals. These features are fused via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to model inter-modal interactions, then processed by a Trans former-based temporal encoder to capture the evolving dynamics of emotional transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal baselines in both accuracy and robustness. The findings highlight the potential of our approach for real-world applications in aviation psychology and other high stakes domains requiring adaptive emotional regulation. © 2010-2012 IEEE."

Until recently, however, medicine was a relative laggard even though our error rates have been just as concerning (Pruitt and Liebelt, Pediatr Emerg Care 26(12):942–948, 2010). Moreover, evidence has long argued that our traditional reliance on a fact-focused and classroom-based medical education is not “fit for task.” This is because it inadequately delivers the practical and non-technical skills required during medical crises, especially when there is stress, incomplete information, and complexity further increasing the likelihood of error and poor decision-making (Ripley, The unthinkable: who survives when disaster strikes. Three Rivers Press, 2008). The myriad of skills required of the modern trauma practitioner and trauma team mandates a more comprehensive, but also a more common sense, approach. This includes understanding the basics of psychology and human factor’s engineering. Specifically, this chapter covers the topic of situational awareness.

"""You're a trainee telling your consultant to hold their question until later"": Using a resident-led faculty development workshop to explore trainee-consultant expertise role-reversal","2025","GMS Journal for Medical Education","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105023453117&partnerID=40&md5=55fe64a82ac708ffd6944e8124b1d210","Background: Medical education traditionally involves directional flow of knowledge/skills/attitudes from a senior to junior individual. However, medical training also provides opportunities for expertise role-reversal, where the direction of flow is reversed. Unlike fields such as aviation, medicine has not yet begun to fully realise the educational potential of this approach. Objective: To better understand how role-reversal is viewed by medical education participants, necessary for its use as a tool to advance both education and patient care. Methods: A senior resident designed and led a feedback-writing workshop for her own consultants (conducted 2022). After the session, eight consultants were interviewed in a semi-structured format. Analysis was conducted using the Stenfors-Hayes phenomenographical approach. Results: A multiplicity of experiential perspectives was identified by both consultants (teacher/participant/supporter/hierarchy member/colleague/holder of multiple perspectives) and trainee (presenter/subordinate/learner/researcher). The exercise increased appreciation and awareness of the complexity of the trainee-consultant educational-power relationship, though both parties maintained traditional hierarchy despite altered informational flow. Participants often held multiple articulated experiential perspectives simultaneously. Conclusions: Consultants were able to assume a learning mindset while simultaneously maintaining awareness of their existing hierarchical relationship to the trainee-presenter; the trainee, conversely, struggled to adopt the teacher mindset. Deliberately viewing moments where trainees present new information to consultants as expertise role-reversal may provide a starting point for more equitable knowledge exchange between both parties in the clinical routine, and a foil for epistemic injustice. Increasing recognition and use of expertise role reversal can play a critical role in improving educational culture.; Hintergrund: Während der ärztlichen Ausbildung werden traditionellerweise Wissen und Fähigkeiten von erfahrenen Ärzt:innen und Fachkräften auf die auszubildenden Ärzt:innen übertragen. Die Ausbildung bietet jedoch auch Gelegenheiten zur didaktischen Rollenumkehr, wo ältere oder erfahrenere Ärzt:innen von jüngeren lernen. Im Gegensatz z.B. zur Luftfahrt, ist dieser Ansatz in der Medizin in seinem didaktischen Potential noch nicht gründlich erforscht. Zielsetzung: Die Zielsetzung dieser Studie ist es, zu untersuchen, wie Teilnehmende an einer ärztlichen Fortbildung eine didaktische Rollenumkehr erleben. Dies könnte sowohl in der Ausbildung als auch in der Praxis zu Verbesserungen der Zusammenarbeit und des Wissensaustauschs führen. Projektbeschreibung: Ein:e Ärzt:in im 2. Jahr ihrer Facharztausbildung (Onkologie, „resident“ im kanadischen Ausbildungssystem) führte eine an ihre Ausbilder („consultants“) gerichtete Fortbildung durch. Das Thema der Fortbildung war das Verfassen von schriftlichem Feedback. Acht an der Fortbildung teilnehmende Fachärzt:innen und die vortragende Ärzt:in nahmen danach an halbstrukturierten Interviews teil; die Daten wurden phenomenografisch nach Stenfor-Hayes ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Es konnten mehrere Perspektiven identifiziert werden, auf deren Basis die anwesenden Fachärzt:innen und die auszubildende Ärzt:in die Fortbildung bewerteten. Dazu gehörten: Lehrkraft, Workshop-Teilnehmer:in, Unterstützer:in, Kolleg:in, Vorgesetze:r innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie (Fachärzt:innen), bzw Vortragende, Untergebene, Forscher:in (vortragende Assistenzärzt:in). Teilnehmende beschrieben auch mehrere gleichzeitig eingenommene Perspektiven. Die Fortbildung führte allseits zu einer klaren Anerkennung und tieferem Verständnis des Arbeitsverhältnisses und der Ausbildungsverantwortung zwischen Lehrkräften und Auszubildenden. Die deutlich unterschiedlichen Positionen in der traditionellen Hierarchie wurden jedoch durchweg gefühlt eingehalten, trotz der umgekehrten Richtung der didaktischen Tätigkeit. Schlussfolgerung: Fachärzt:innen und auch der/die anwesende Chefärzt:in konnten sich in die Rolle der/des Lernenden hineinversetzen, obwohl sie sich gleichzeitig der Verantwortung und Weisungsbefugtheit gegenüber der auszubildenden Ärzt:in bewusst waren. Diese jedoch tat sich zunächst schwer damit, innerlich die Rolle der Lehrkraft einzunehmen. Im klinischen Alltag gibt es häufig Situationen, in denen Assistenzärzt:innen, PJler, usw Fachärzt:innen oder Chefärzt:innen neue oder zusätzlich Informationen zu ihren Patienten geben, und solche Situationen könnten auch als didaktische Rollenumkehr aufgefasst werden. Falls eine situationsbezogen bewusste didaktische Rollenumkehr zu einer akzeptierten Praxis während der ärztliche Ausbildung werden sollte, könnte dies auch der epistemischen Ungerechtigkeit entgegenwirken, die sonst leicht aufgrund der Differenzen innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie auftreten kann und etwaige wichtige Beiträge und Einblicke innerhalb eines Teams unterbinden kann. © © 2025 Preti et al."

"Impact of High Altitude on Military Operations: An Overview","2025","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105022388521&partnerID=40&md5=45b7021f8c4b12c26ff49b69d3f01010","High altitude poses problems for mountaineers, local inhabitants, and sojourners and can also substantially affect military expeditions, as it presents an assortment of difficulties that can be exacerbated during medical evacuation, particularly in exploration, humanitarian aid during disasters and combat situations. These impacts fall under three categories: physiological, environmental, and tactical. The impact of high altitude on physiological aspects includes: (i) Altitude sickness: troops at high altitude encounter acute mountain sickness (AMS), common sicknesses such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and fatigue. However, prophylaxis with acetazolamide and dexamethasone, followed by proper acclimatization of troops, could alleviate the symptoms of altitude sicknesses. (ii) Severe cases of altitude sickness can progress into high-altitude maladies, which include: high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), thromboembolic disorders, and cold injuries like frostbite, chilblain, etc. (iii) Decreased physical performance: reduced oxygen levels impair endurance and physical stamina. Individuals may experience early fatigue and a progressive decline in physical strength. (iv) Impact on cognitive functions: decision-making, memory, and focus are three cognitive processes susceptible to compromise by hypoxia and are vital in effective military operations. On the other hand, the impact of environmental conditions on high altitudes includes extremes of weather, terrain, etc. Military expeditions can be affected due to tactical and decision-making abilities, e.g, logistics supply, high-altitude communication systems, aviation, training and acclimatization. The present chapter gives insight into overcoming the challenges of high altitude on the human system by considering the above-discussed factors that can affect military expeditions at high altitudes. © 2025 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

This improves overall health and well-being. Rapid technological advancements without considering local needs often result in failure and worker alienation. About 77 years after independence, India has seen increased awareness and research in ergonomics, expanding beyond industrial applications to health, consumer products, defense, and agriculture. However, a major challenge remains: the absence of a categorized anthropometric database, which limits the development of products and facilities suited to the diverse needs of India’s population. There is a pressing need for comprehensive research into the physical, physiological, cognitive, and psychological characteristics of India’s varied ethnic groups. Ergonomics can help evaluate both indigenous and imported technologies to ensure their effective use in India. This highlights the necessity for a strong Indian knowledge base, including standards, recommendations, and procedures for occupational health and safety. Given India’s diverse factors like climate, demographics, and infrastructure, customized research across sectors is essential. DIPAS, as a leader in military ergonomics research, focuses on enhancing soldier performance and health, applying cognitive and physical ergonomics to improve systems and optimize human–machine–environment interactions. Armed forces personnel operate in diverse environments, facing both physical and mental challenges. Air force operations involve G-forces, rapid maneuvers, and communication, while naval operations include long-term sea activities, sensory changes, and seasickness. Both settings contribute to high cognitive stress due to environmental factors and constant mental demands. Physical ergonomics is crucial in designing human–machine interfaces (HMIs) to enhance user comfort, performance, and safety. It involves tailoring designs based on anthropometric data, ensuring that controls, displays, and seating accommodate users’ body dimensions. Ergonomic considerations minimize physical strain, reduce repetitive injuries, and optimize task efficiency by streamlining workflows. Well-designed HMIs also improve safety by ensuring users can easily interact with machines. Additionally, accessibility for diverse users, including those with disabilities, is considered. Critical elements should be within optimal visual fields, and designs customized to users’ needs increase satisfaction by reducing frustration and enhancing the overall experience. Human biomechanics applies principles of mechanics to study the human body’s response to forces, combining engineering with physiology and anatomy. It includes kinematics (movement) and kinetics (causes of movement). In defense, biomechanics aids in understanding musculoskeletal systems, muscle activation, and optimizing performance using tools like force platforms and electromyography. © 2025 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Traditional methods, such as subjective scales (e.g., NASA Task Load Index) and behavioral observation, suffer from inherent biases and limited sensitivity to subtle cognitive changes. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven framework for workload state classification using multi-modal physiological signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG). The signals undergo preprocessing via filtering, normalization, and sliding window segmentation, followed by feature extraction (time-domain statistics, power spectral density, Riemannian kernels) and fusion. Three machine learning models - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - are implemented and optimized. Experimental results on a dataset of 109,000 samples demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 90% accuracy, outperforming traditional subjective methods. The RF model outperforms others, attributed to its ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data and its strong fitting capability. This study validates the potential of multi-modal signal fusion and deep learning for real-time cognitive state monitoring in aviation. © 2025 IEEE."

Conventional stress management approaches—such as medication, therapy, or environmental modulation— offer limited adaptability and personalization within the dynamic and high-stakes environment of space. This paper presents BUZZ-PR, an integrated neuroadaptive system designed to monitor, detect, and mitigate astronaut stress and fatigue through real-time biosensing and non-invasive neuromodulation. The system employs electroencephalography (EEG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to monitor neurological and physiological indicators of stress, including beta-to-theta EEG band ratios, heart rate variability (HRV), and frontal alpha asymmetry. These biosignals are processed through a machine learning-based classification model and compared against individualized thresholds established via preflight functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Upon detection of a stress state, BUZZ-PR activates a closed-loop transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocol, targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), to modulate neural activity and restore cognitive performance.

Phase 2 simulates weightlessness conditions in the Jules Undersea habitat of the Florida Keys, and/or the PECA Interstellar “Underwater” Lab. These I.C.E. settings recreate hyperbaric stress on the astronaut. For Phase 3, the field test will simulate high-altitude hypoxia. It will utilize a remote LUNAR habitat located at ambient pressure at 8000 ft in altitude on volcanic Mauna Loa or missions to 15,000ft at Amadablam Basecamp in Nepal, Himalayas, to introduce cognitive and mission motivators applicable to both space flight and undersea missions (Jewell, S. et al., 2017, 2019). The study will use biopsychological, genomic, and epigenomic measures to determine their effects on cognitive performance, emotional regulation, and physiological resilience. Blood and saliva samples will be obtained for DNA methylation and gene expression changes related to stress and immune response. We will use Polaris Genomics and Mindx genetic analysis platforms to perform and collect biological samples during the missions. The broader impacts of this research extend beyond space exploration (Nezami et al, 2022) with applications in isolated, confined, and extreme (I.C.E.) environments on Earth, such as polar stations, submarines, and remote healthcare settings. Additionally, the findings may inform mental health care interventions for vulnerable populations like refugees, disaster relief workers, and victims of PTSD.

Methods: Data were collected from 357 ATCs using established questionnaires measuring job satisfaction, burnout, and safety behavior. Bootstrap analysis was employed to examine the mediating effect of burnout, and a decision tree model was applied to determine the key factors influencing safety behavior. Results: The bootstrap analysis revealed that burnout partially mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and safety behavior, accounting for 40% of the total effect. The decision tree model identified burnout as the primary predictor of safety behavior, followed by job satisfaction and other factors. Discussion: These findings underscore the critical role of burnout in influencing ATCs’ safety performance.

"Differentiating pilot distress and eustress via multimodal physiology: towards enhanced human-system integration in intelligent cockpits","2025","Ergonomics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014911536&partnerID=40&md5=422cdbb90806597cace60d7129629964","Ensuring safety in next-generation intelligent cockpits demands accurate assessment of pilot states, particularly distinguishing between eustress and distress. Traditional stress monitoring lacks this nuance and struggles across varying flight tasks. This study proposes a multimodal neuro-cardiac framework combining functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electrocardiography (ECG) to differentiate eustress and distress across tasks. Physiological data were collected from 35 participants under simulated flight missions inducing both stress types. Eleven features showing significant differentiation were identified and used to train classification models with machine learning algorithms. The model achieved 83.04% accuracy across tasks, and up to 90.83% within single tasks. These findings demonstrate the robustness of fNIRS-ECG-based monitoring in pilot stress classification. The proposed method offers objective biomarkers critical for adaptive intelligent cockpit systems, contributing directly to flight safety and human-machine interaction optimisation. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This article focuses on identifying factors influencing air passengers' environmental awareness and resulting behaviour change towards more environmentally friendly air travel behaviour. A conceptual factor model is developed based on a systematic literature review of prevailing research (N = 111) and semi-structured interviews with experts (N = 14) from the aviation industry and beyond in Europe. The model distinguishes between demographic factors, internal factors, such as knowledge and values, and external factors, such as media usage and government policies. Three main parties emerge as forces that drive passengers towards increasing awareness and behaviour change: government, airlines, and social movement groups. The media is found to be a mediator. Focusing on the gap between attitude and behaviour, we summarize the factors that contribute to it and propose strategies to mitigate it. © 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."

Such stress can result in errors in the treatment of these emergencies. Furthermore, medical practitioners who frequently encounter these stressors, such as anesthesiologists, are at an elevated risk of developing health issues, including burnout. To reduce errors in the diagnosis and treatment of emergencies during surgery, an algorithm-based cognitive aid has been developed by adapting human factors concepts from aviation. The eGENA application was first released in 2020 and has since been implemented in numerous pilot hospitals in Germany. First results concerning user acceptance and the impact of eGENA on a range of performance indicators during surgical procedures have already been documented. This chapter presents an overview of the empirical results obtained thus far. Furthermore, the chapter presents new findings from a recent pilot study examining the impact of eGENA utilization on individual stress levels during surgical procedures. In a within-subjects experimental design, subjective stress measures were collected from 20 physicians and nurses during a simulated operation with and without eGENA. The results indicate an improvement in performance with eGENA, however, the influence of stress remains inconclusive. The theoretical and methodological aspects are discussed, and potential directions for further stress research in simulated surgical settings are proposed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."

This study introduces CLNet, a lightweight neural network for accurate classification of cognitive load states. Utilizing multi-scale spatiotemporal convolution, CLNet enhances feature extraction from physiological signals, significantly boosting accuracy. Ablation studies highlight the roles of the squeeze-and-excitation and temporal gate convolution modules. To evaluate the effectiveness of CLNet, we developed the Airfield Traffic Pattern Cognitive Load (ATPCL) dataset, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) signals recorded during key flight phases. On the ATPCL dataset, CLNet achieved an accuracy of 95.1%. We also built an integrated online monitoring system for real-time data collection, processing, and visualization.

This study investigates how personality traits, as defined by the Big Five Inventory (BFI), influence perceived threats from cabin service robots, with a novel focus on role-dependent differences between passengers and flight attendants. A dual-role survey was administered to 497 participants, who completed the BFI and then evaluated realistic threats (e.g., job displacement, safety risks) and identity threats (e.g., erosion of human roles) posed by cabin service robots, assuming both passenger and flight attendant roles. This study revealed significant role-modulated associations: When acting as flight attendants, higher neuroticism (N) correlated with elevated realistic threats and identity threats, while higher agreeableness (A) predicted reduced realistic threats. In the passenger role, only the negative association between agreeableness and realistic threats persisted. No gender-based differences in perceived threats emerged across roles. The study advances social robotics literature by (1) demonstrating the dual-role paradigm's utility in disentangling human-robot interaction dynamics and (2) identifying neuroticism as a pivotal trait in threat perception within high-responsibility service roles. Practical implications include tailored robot design and crew training strategies to mitigate role-specific anxieties, fostering smoother human-robot collaboration in aviation contexts. © 2025 IEEE."

This study proposes a multimodal emotion quantification framework integrating fuzzy logic and deep learning to address continuous mixed-state modeling. We optimized flight simulation experiments to collect synchronized facial expressions, ECG, and skin conductance data, establishing a 3D PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) emotion space spanning five basic emotions. The novel ELG-Transformer dual-channel architecture was developed: 1) The ELG module employs multi-scale convolution and feature shrinkage attention to capture subtle spatiotemporal facial micro-expressions; 2) The Transformer module utilizes multi-head self-attention to model global dependencies in physiological signals. A fuzzy emotion analysis layer with Gaussian membership functions is introduced to map cross-modal features into continuous PAD space, enabling intensity quantification of mixed emotions. Experiments show that the model achieves MAE = 0.11 ± 0.03 in PAD dimension prediction, which is about 35.3% higher than the traditional model, and can effectively identify typical compound states such as anger-fear. The research results provide a quantitative emotional analysis tool for aviation human factors intelligent monitoring and flight safety early warning, which can support the dynamic decision optimization of flight safety early warning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."

In this paper, a real-time Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system based on the LSTM network that recognizes emotion from audio input is introduced. The dataset includes 1,440 audio recordings with emotions such as calm, happy, sad, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutral. Key to methodology are the selection of a reliable database for emotional speech, feature extraction, such as Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and development of an effective LSTM model. The basic idea behind the model is to enable improved human-computer interaction through the understanding of vocal input analysis and classification so that the system can classify emotions. The proposed study improves emotion recognition accuracy with an overall accuracy ranging around 82.2%. This development is significant, not just in terms of the improvement it brings about in computational linguistics, but it will have practical applications trying to make improvements in user experience with regard to diverse domains, such as customer service and support for mental health services.

Professions such as aviation, emergency medicine, military service, and law enforcement require individuals as well as entire teams to navigate unpredictable, high-stakes situations where cognitive agility, emotion regulation, and stress resilience are essential. Without adequate mental preparedness, professionals and team members are more susceptible to impaired decision making, burnout, and psychological disorders, which can compromise both individual and organizational effectiveness. Despite its significance, mental readiness remains underemphasized in traditional selection and training programs, which often prioritize technical and physical skills. However, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience offer new opportunities to enhance cognitive resilience. AI-driven predictive analytics, virtual reality (VR) training simulations, and biofeedback systems provide innovative methods for assessing and strengthening psychological preparedness. These technologies can help identify early signs of mental strain, optimize decision-making strategies, and develop personalized interventions to mitigate stress-related risks. This paper explores the role of mental readiness in high-stress professions, emphasizing its impact on performance, safety, and mental health. It also examines emerging AI-based methodologies and psychological strategies designed to enhance resilience, improve decision making, and foster long-term occupational sustainability. By integrating these approaches, organizations can better prepare individuals and team members for the psychological demands of their roles, reducing the likelihood of stress-induced errors and improving overall professional effectiveness. © Medicinska naklada – Zagreb, Croatia."

A sufficiently sensitive screening test of cognitive function, based on the typical cognitive effects of COVID-19 and skills considered most relevant to pilot performance, would be highly beneficial to be used alongside other performance checks. This study aimed to identify appropriate screening tests for post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: I nitially, a systematic search and narrative review identified 13 screening tools that are likely to be effective in screening pilots for post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairment. Following a more in-depth evaluation of the identified tools, five tests including the Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Color Word Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were chosen for a Delphi evaluation exercise. A two-round modified Delphi process was undertaken with international aviation medicine and psychology experts to obtain a consensus on which of the identified tests would be appropriate to screen for cognitive dysfunction in pilots. RESULTS: Based on evaluation of literature review findings and Delphi consultation with subject matter experts, the Trail Making Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were identified as quick and suitable screening tests likely to detect post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. DISCUSSION: T hese tools are objective, have good utility, are available in multiple versions, and assess cognitive abilities relevant to pilot performance. Their use for screening in aeromedical examinations would be further supported by confirming their ability to reliably detect neurocognitive impacts associated with COVID-19. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

Introduction: Malfunctions and human errors in diving rebreathers can cause hypoxia, hyperoxia, and/or hypercapnia. We evaluated whether a prior unblinded hypoxia experience enhances a diver’s ability to recognise hypoxia and initiate self-rescue. Methods: Forty participants were randomised to receive either an information leaflet describing hypoxia symptoms or an unblinded hypoxia experience, prior to a blinded hypoxia testing exposure during a virtual reality dive over one month later. The primary outcome was the comparison of the proportion of participants in these two groups who initiated self-rescue before reaching a peripheral oxygen saturation of 70% in the blinded exposure. An individual’s ‘symptom profile’ was assessed by comparing symptoms during the unblinded hypoxia experience and blinded testing exposures. Results: During the blinded hypoxia testing exposure, 18/20 (90%) participants in the hypoxia experience group performed a self-initiated rescue compared to 6/18 (33%) in the information leaflet group (P < 0.001). Participants in the information leaflet group had lower mean SpO<inf>2</inf> (73.4% vs 81.4%, mean difference 8% [95% CI = 2.5–13.5%, P = 0.005]) and lower inhaled oxygen fraction (7.6% vs 9.4%, mean difference 1.8% [95% CI = 0.6−3.1%, P = 0.005]) at self-rescue. The most frequent and severe symptoms were light-headedness and shortness of breath. Of the 20 participants completing both hypoxia exposures, 14 (70%) had a consistent hypoxia symptom profile, which was not related to the ability to recognise hypoxia. Conclusions: Self-rescue was approximately three times more likely for participants who had previously experienced hypoxia compared to simply receiving information on relevant symptoms. Most participants exhibited a consistent pattern of individual symptoms, which did not result in earlier or improved detection of hypoxia. © 2025, South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society and the European Underwater and Baromedical Society.

"Using perceptual speed tests to improve pilot selection","2025","Transportation Research Procedia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009266667&partnerID=40&md5=ac0da25c07b3f21a4bbf6464f40de8a0","Perceptual speed (PS) tests have been commonly used in military and civil pilot selection batteries for over 80 years. This paper compares paper and computerized versions of two PS tests for gender differences and age effects. Additionally, the relation between the personality dimensions and performance on the PS tests was examined because few data have studied that relationship. The Table Reading Test (TRT) is an updated version of a pilot selection test developed in 1942 that has been in continuous use. The Tabular Speed Test (TST) is a ""sister""test developed for civilian pilot selection. Both the US Air Force and Damos Aviation Services, Inc. had delayed computerizing their PS tests because of concerns that computerization would potentially reduce the required scanning and memory load, reducing the predictive validity, and possibly causing gender differences and age effects. The paper TRT was administered to 4,882 military pilot trainees who had completed the first phase of training. The computerized version was administered to 2,453 officer candidates who selected ""pilot""as their first career choice. All military candidates also completed a Big Five personality inventory. The paper TST was administered to 257 students enrolled in a profession pilot curriculum at a US university. The computerized TST was administered to 115 candidates applying for a state-sponsored flying school. Both the computerized versions of the TRT and TST showed minor changes in mean score compared to their paper counterparts. Female trainees taking the paper version of the TRT scored slightly better than males on number correct (#Correct). In the officer candidate sample, females scored slightly lower than males. Both versions of the TST showed females performing slightly better than males on both #Correct and the number wrong (#Wrong). On the paper TRT #Correct increased gradually from age 18 to 30 in both military samples. Both the computerized and the paper versions of the TRT showed no age effect. The relationship with personality was relatively unremarkable, but results indicate that Conscientiousness and Neuroticism may be related to PS. The small effect of age and gender make PS tests strong candidates for pilot selection batteries. © 2024 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V."

This paper delves into a two-fold approach, encompassing both crew and management perspectives, to prioritize well-being and mental health as the cornerstones of future aviation safety. Drawing insights from the MESAFE (MEntal health for aviation SAFEty) and HAIKU (Human AI teaming Knowledge and Understanding for aviation safety) projects, we bridge the gap between current crew training and a future shaped by AI-powered intelligent assistants. Acknowledging existing stressors like fatigue and workload, we propose solutions tailored to the unique mental challenges posed by AI integration. Crucially, we advocate for an evolution of the ""just culture""concept, shifting its focus from solely addressing reported errors to proactive early detection and prevention of mental health concerns. This proactive approach could foster open communication and trust within the air transport workforce, positively impacting safety and performance. Leveraging on the results of the MESAFE project and anticipating future trends as outlined in the HAIKU project's operational use cases, we propose an evolution of Crew Resource Management (CRM) training. This enhanced training equips aircrews with the necessary tools to navigate future stressors, ensuring a mentally healthy workforce and safeguarding the skies for everyone. By seamlessly integrating these initiatives, we pave the way for a future where mental well-being leads to aviation safety, ensuring a journey that is not only physically safe but also mentally sound for all actors involved. © 2024 The Authors.

"Development of an HTO-based framework for occupational health management in high-risk environments","2025","Transportation Research Procedia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009262960&partnerID=40&md5=11d4d762f3748450df696e60a336547d","The modern work environment continuously presents new demands on employees, often resulting in health-related impacts. Consequently, occupational health management (OHM) is gaining increasing importance (Zanko & Dawson, 2012; Sorensen et al., 2021). High-risk environments (HREs) such as aviation, healthcare, or the military, represent unique work settings. These environments are characterized by higher levels of stress and strain for personnel, and other challenges especially for their mental health. Additionally, due to their specific working conditions, it is more challenging to implement conventional OHM measures into the daily routines within HREs. This creates a need to develop an OHM concept tailored for HREs that can meet their specific requirements. Given the particular complexity of these work environments, a holistic model like the human-technology-organization-approach (HTO-approach, Strohm & Ulich, 1997), which maps the interdependencies of these elements, is suitable to explain and account for the multitude of influencing factors. Complex models in health science are typically used to describe and categorize stress factors, their interrelationships, and their effects. The framework presented here follows a preventive approach and aims to illustrate supportive and protective measures along with their interactions. To develop a practical and effective OHM framework suitable as a template for HREs such as aviation, the following approach was taken: Systematic literature reviews on OHM and HREs were conducted as part of several academic studies. A definition of ""HRE""from an ergonomic or occupational science perspective was created, including a characterization using evaluation criteria for HREs that were developed in a subsequent study. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to identify the specific demands of the modern work environment and particularly those of HREs on their employees and their health. To assess existing approaches and their implementation in relevant work environments, expert interviews were conducted with OHM managers from the fields of aviation, military, emergency services, air rescue, and railways. Based on this, a holistic framework of OHM was developed for the operational area of an airline, grounded in the human-technology-organization-approach, designed to meet the specific demands of HREs in the modern work environment. © 2024 The Authors.

"Barriers to Mental Health Seeking in Army Aviation Personnel","2025","Transportation Research Procedia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009209343&partnerID=40&md5=c3b9df722b2077c90e72e61f7fffe0c0","OVERVIEW: Aviation operations require constant vigilance where personnel must perform their duties under significant physical and psychological stress. Prolonged or intense stress events can lead to mental health issues, even among those with formal resilience training. Barriers to mental health seeking prevent military aviation personnel from receiving the assistance they need, yet little is known about these barriers, undiagnosed symptom levels, and perceived acceptability of self-help mental wellness options. METHODS: Quantitative survey responses were collected from more than 525 current and former U.S. Army Aviation aircrews, ATC personnel, and UAS operators recruited via social media between October 2023 and February 2024. We assessed barriers to seeking mental healthcare using the Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation - Version 3 (BACE3). Additionally, we measured self-reported anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms using the Public Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ4) and the four-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL4-5). To evaluate the acceptability of three self-help mental wellness techniques - Mindfulness Training, Transcendental Meditation, and Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (I-CBT) - we used an author-developed questionnaire that considered scenarios with and without approval from civilian and military regulators. RESULTS: The results indicate organizational stigma and attitudinal barriers play the most significant role in inhibiting mental healthcare seeking among the population, while instrumental barriers play a lesser but significant role, especially among UAS operators. Self-assessed mental health symptom levels were nearly four times those documented in previous research utilizing medical records reviews, with UAS operators exhibiting higher levels than other aviation career fields. Finally, I-CBT and Mindfulness Training demonstrated the greatest acceptability among self-help mental wellness options. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that a large percentage of U.S. Army Aviation personnel operate with diagnosable mental health symptom levels. To overcome mental health hesitance, outreach should focus on combatting perceived stigma by employers and regulators, along with dispelling internal mindsets against mental health within the Army Aviation community. Mindfulness Training and I-CBT demonstrate promising self-help options, providing possible avenues for overcoming stigma and attitudinal barriers among this and other aviation populations. © 2024 The Authors.

This historical article explores Gemelli’s groundbreaking contributions to understanding spatial cognition, particularly in aviation contexts, decades before contemporary scientific findings. During World War I, Gemelli, a medical officer and pilot, focused on selecting pilots based on their attitudes rather than their physical abilities. His work predated crucial developments in spatial cognition, including concepts of field dependence/independence and environmental representation. Gemelli examined perception through Gestalt psychology, showing that people create mental images of space instead of just recording what they see. Gemelli critically analyzed spatial orientation, distinguishing between ground and aerial navigation and recognizing the complex interaction between internal cognitive characteristics and external environmental factors. He anticipated modern research on spatial representation, emphasizing the dynamic nature of spatial perception and individual differences in cognitive processing. This article highlights Gemelli’s insights in relation to modern science, showcasing his keen understanding of spatial cognition, pilot skills, and perception. His contributions, largely ignored after World War II, were an important early exploration of the cognitive mechanisms behind spatial orientation and aviation psychology. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Injured soldiers often undergo multiple flights after injury to access medical care and return to duty. Previous work has shown that low air pressure during air travel (hypobaria [HB]) exacerbates neurological injury, but the effects of one or more HB exposures on chronic brain injury are unknown. We hypothesized that multiple HB exposures after TBI would result in worse outcomes than 0-1 exposures. Sedated male ferrets underwent UVB and controlled cortical impact (CCI) under anesthesia (BCCI), followed by zero (normobaria [BCCI + NB]), one (BCCI + 1HB), or five (BCCI + 5HB) 6-h HB exposure(s) over 6 months post-injury or remained experimentally naïve. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed with the Open Field at 6 months post-injury. Ferrets also underwent T<inf>2</inf>-weighted (T2w), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging scans at pre-injury baseline and 6 months post-injury under anesthesia. Relative to naïve, BCCI + 5HB animals expressed significantly more anxiety-like behavior. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional connectivity (FC) analysis was conducted to evaluate FC changes within the anxiety network. ROI-based diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging modeling was conducted to evaluate the white matter (WM) integrity of major anxiety-associated WM tracts. Results indicated increased FC between prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus and decreased fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis in cerebral WM, corpus callosum, cingulum, and fornix WM tracts when comparing BCCI + 5HB with all other groups. Together, these suggest that multiple HB exposures after BCCI exacerbate changes in neurological activity in the anxiety regulation brain network, as well as structural damage in the anxiety-associated WM tracts. Our findings demonstrate that air travel after TBI, particularly multiple flights, can have a chronic negative impact on brain structure and function. © 2025, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."

H. Foulkes to the form of psychotherapy he developed from 1943 onwards. As a psychoanalyst trained in a classical tradition, Foulkes brought to his work a knowledge of and adherence to many of the basic principles of psychoanalysis, combined with a deep appreciation of the social nature of humans and the profound importance of socialisation processes in the development of the personality. The combination of these two viewpoints led him to the logical application of these principles to small-group psychotherapy in a formal setting. Many of his fundamental ideas were derived from and confirmed by the experience of working as an army psychiatrist at Northfield, a psychiatric military hospital, during World War II, where he laid down many of the fundamental principles of the therapeutic community (Main 1946). This experience of larger groups as well as the small formal psychotherapeutic group laid the foundations for the application of group-analytic principles and settings other than the small group. Group-analytic principles therefore have been influential in the development of large-group psychotherapy and of the therapeutic community and family therapy. © 2025 Malcolm Pines."

Airline pilots are exposed to psychosocial risks, and they may constitute a population at risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorders. However, mental health remains difficult to assess in this population due to the risk of being declared unfit to fly. Scientific studies on mental disorders in airline pilots are rare, and the results are heterogeneous. To date, no study has been conducted describing anxiety or depressive disorders among European airline pilots. Method: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study using an anonymous online self-questionnaire. Pilots were recruited from the National Union of Airline Pilots between September 1 and October 16, 2022. Findings: Out of the 1,220 pilots surveyed, 25.4% of them suffered from anxiety according to the Hospital and Depression Scale (HAD): 14.4% suspected anxiety disorders and 11.0% confirmed anxiety disorders. Additionally, 13.1% of subjects reported depressive symptoms, including 8.9% suspected depressive disorders and 4.2% confirmed depressive disorders, according to the HAD. More than a third of the sample (40.1%) showed alcohol misuse. Interpretation: This study represents a major advancement in understanding the mental health of European airline pilots. This work highlights the need to implement prevention programs targeting profiles at risk of developing anxiety and/or depressive disorders. Our study also showed that a large proportion of subjects exhibited alcohol misuse, which requires prevention efforts to reduce health risks. In the future, conducting longitudinal studies would further strengthen our knowledge on this topic. © © 2025 Percheron, Prouvost-Keller, Allouche, Benoit and Pradier."

The purpose is to highlight the formation and development of psychophysiology and professional psychophysiological selection in Russia, reflecting the role of scientists at the S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy in this process. Materials and methods. General scientific (analysis, synthesis, generalization), and special historical (historical-genetic, historical-systemic) methods are used. Results. The work of scientists from the Kirov Military Medical Academy made a decisive contribution to the development of psychophysiology in our country. In the early 1860s, I.M. Sechenov laid the theoretical foundation for psychophysiology in medicine. V.M. Bekhterev opened and headed the clinic of nervous diseases with Russia’s first Department of surgical neuropathology, managed a psychological laboratory. Pavlov’s teaching on conditioned reflexes and types of higher nervous activity was a milestone in the development of psychophysiology. L.A. Orbeli emphasized the close relationship between physiological and psychophysiological research, conducted laboratory and field studies of the activities in divers, pilots, parachutists, and other military specialists. In 1947, the Department of Experimental Psychology headed by K.K. Platonov was established at the Institute of Aviation Medicine, and in 1964, psychological selection of candidates for pilots was introduced, and psychophysiological laboratories were established. Since that time, great attention has been paid to the problems of psychophysiology at the S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy, and G.I. Gurvich, V.I. Kopanev, V.I. Medvedev, A.A. Bochenkov, and others have worked on them. In 1997, the Department of Military Psychophysiology was established at the Military Medical Academy under the leadership of V.N. Sysoev. Conclusion. The achievements of psychophysiology are widely used in clinical practice and occupational medicine. It is necessary to develop methods of psychophysiological selection of specialists in dangerous professions, psychophysiological training aimed at preserving their health and improving the reliability and safety of professional activities, the creation and implementation in practice of methods for monitoring the functional state and its correction. © 2025 Meditsina Publishers.

The attempts to modernize the Warsaw Convention Regime have been largely successful. One aspect of the Convention that has received comparatively less attention has been its interaction with aviation insurers. From its inception, the Convention has earnestly attempted to ensure continuity with its predecessor and safeguard its stated objective of legal uniformity in determining that the liability of an airline to its passengers and shippers is maintained. This is an important objective for insurers as legal certainty in assessing such liability and particularly the determination of jurisdiction is prized by insurers as they analyse, rate the premium, and, in this article’s context, adjust claims in the aftermath of a loss. At the same time, the remarkable improvement in the operational safety of air travel has, from an insurer’s perspective, required consideration of a partial repurposing of the Convention’s value in addressing the handling and adjustment of the smaller, so-called every day, claims that airline and their insurers typically face. Together with the explosion in passenger numbers, heightened consumer awareness and a re-evaluation of the impact of mental health during the intervening twenty-five years, it is a repurposing that is necessary to ensure the Convention maintains its relevance in the future. © 2025 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands"

While prior studies have focused on the Big Five and HEXACO models in ethical decision-making, empirical applications of the Eysenck framework to honesty prediction remain scarce-particularly in aviation, where dishonest acts (e.g., underreporting safety incidents) carry severe public safety consequences. Methods: We collected behavioral data from 102 flight and air traffic control cadets using a coin-toss task. Explainable machine learning (XGBoost) was employed to model nonlinear relationships between personality, gender, and honesty. Model performance was evaluated via AUC, with SHAP analysis identifying key predictors. Results: XGBoost achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.802). SHAP analysis revealed: (1) neuroticism as the strongest predictor of dishonesty; (2) significant gender differences (higher dishonesty rates in males); and (3) threshold effects for Psychoticism and Extraversion. Discussion: This work makes three key contributions: (1) first systematic application of the Eysenck model to aviation honesty prediction; (2) identification of gender as a critical moderating variable; and (3) development of a SHAP-driven interpretable framework that connects machine learning outputs with psychological theory. Practically, these findings enable data-driven screening of cadets' honesty tendencies during recruitment, facilitating targeted interventions for safer aviation operations. © © 2025 Meng, Peng, Zhang, Chen, Huang, Chen and Zhao."

The European, Australian and International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines for the assessment of PTSD in aviation are general guidelines and do not address the unique and specific circumstances of a flight crew per se. The starting point of the U.S. FAA’s guidance is an already-established clinical PTSD diagnosis since it is known that PTSD compromises aviation safety and has been related to fatal aviation accidents. According to the FAA’s guidance, a PTSD assessment is undertaken based on whether the condition is symptomatic and medicated, or whether more than 2 years have elapsed since showing symptoms and receiving medication. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria for stress disorders have changed between versions ICD-10 and the soon-to-be-released ICD-11. The new ICD-11 criteria are discussed in this article in the context of aviation health. Additionally, PTSD, potentially caused by an incident of turbulence, is discussed in the context of aviation mental health. There are currently no published studies on turbulence-caused mental trauma. We have identified in this article potential factors which are related to pilots’ and cabin crew’s stressors in incidents of severe and extreme turbulence. Three recommendations are provided: (1) harmonize assessment practices of PTSD internationally; (2) healthcare professionals taking care of traumatized flight crew should have a follow-up guide that takes specific and local conditions into account, and ensures the identification of patients who require follow-up treatment as early as possible; and (3) aviation health care professionals should consider ICD-11 diagnostic criteria as the information may be more useful in the assessment and diagnosis of aviation-related trauma. © © 2025 Vuorio, Bor, Budowle, Gray and Suhonen-Malm."

In this paper, we provide a narrative review of research on the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual-cognitive expertise in sport, a domain where individuals possess highly specialized perceptual-cognitive skills (i.e., expertise) that enable successful performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we discuss how work from domains with more static, predictable stimuli for perception and decision-making (e.g., radiology, chess) can enhance understanding of the neuroscience of expertise in sport.

Learning outcomes significantly impacted perceived usefulness, along with information quality, perceived ease of use, and system quality. Additionally, learning outcomes had the greatest effect on user satisfaction, followed by perceived usefulness, information quality, and system quality. Perceived usefulness had a more substantial impact on attitude toward use than perceived ease of use. Regarding perceived ease of use, system quality was the most influential factor, followed by computer self-efficacy and course design. The proposed framework enhances understanding of the relationship between technology adoption theory and the IS success model. The study’s findings can help policymakers, software developers, and educators improve the e-learning process and maintain the quality of education. © 2024 Belo et al.

"Meeting Men Where they are: Motivators and Barriers to Accessing Health Services through a Men’s Mobile Wellness Clinic, October 2019 to March 2020, Blantyre, Malawi","2024","Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206377754&partnerID=40&md5=a6e7e7cf441d3596baeaf3ac62705e3e","Background: In Malawi approximately, 88.3% people living with HIV are aware of their HIV status. Significant gaps are among men aged 15–34 years; only 72% know their HIV status. To reach men, Jhpiego, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH), implemented the Men’s Mobile Wellness Clinic (MMWC) at workplace settings in Blantyre, Malawi between October 2019 and March 2020. Methods: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study to understand motivators and barriers to MMWC service uptake by employees and employers. Primary data was drawn from in-depth telephone interviews from four study populations: employers who accepted or declined to host the MMWC at their worksite, and employees who accessed or did not access the services. We performed a thematic analysis using Nvivo 12 software to identify patterns and themes across the dataset. Findings: Main reasons given for using the service among male employees were a desire to know their health status, availability of free health services at the workplace, and good quality services offered by MMWC staff, and support from their supervisor. Men who did not access services stated reasons such as work-clinic scheduling conflicts, lack of adequate promotion of the service, and miscommunication on the criteria about who should attend the MMWC. Employers who accepted to host the MMWC stated convenience and employee’s rights to know their health status. Those who declined either stated that employees did not want the services or COVID-19 preventive measures by the MOH between October 2019 and March 2020 restricted participation. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential utility of MMWC services including HIV testing among men. The desire to know their health status, availability of free MMWC services at the workplace, good quality services offered by MMWC staff, and the endorsement of MMWC by supervisors were main motivators to access the MMWC services. Sensitizing supervisors and employees about the benefits of the MMWC services, strengthening demand creation, and clarifying eligibility are important to facilitate MMWC uptake among men in Malawi. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024."
"Navigating the skies: a cross-sectional study of depression among Saudi Arabian airline pilots","2024","Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203000968&partnerID=40&md5=36a43b6142f3173a066ed4033d1284f3","Background: Depression poses a significant challenge globally, including in safety-critical industries such as aviation. In Saudi Arabia, where the aviation sector is rapidly expanding, pilots encounter unique stressors inherent to their profession. However, research on pilot mental health, particularly within the Saudi context, remains limited despite its critical role in flight safety. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was designed to estimate the self-reported prevalence of depression in a convenience sample of airline pilots in Saudi Arabia. Participants were recruited from various commercial airlines in Saudi Arabia. Recruitment efforts utilized targeted outreach on social media platforms, focusing on pilot forums and groups. The survey was administered online for accessibility and convenience. The structured questionnaire, developed through a literature review and expert consultation, comprises sections on demographic and professional characteristics, occupational information, health habits, and depression assessment via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: This study enrolled 310 participants, with the largest cohort (34.8%, n = 108) falling within the 30–39 years age group, closely followed by individuals under 30 years (30.0%, n = 93). Males dominated the sex distribution (99.0%, n = 307). The mean PHQ-9 score was 8.2 ± 5.4. Notably, 40.6% (n = 126) of the participants had a score of 10 or higher, indicating the potential for moderate, moderate-severe, or severe depression. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis revealed that pilots with 11–15 years of experience had greater odds of experiencing depression than did those with 0–10 years of experience did (odds ratio [OR]: 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.1–8.4], p = 0.04). Pilots with rest times exceeding 24 h had lower odds of depression than did those with rest times less than 1 h (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: [0.1–0.8], p = 0.02). Engaging in regular exercise was associated with reduced odds of depression (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: [0.2–0.5], p < 0.01), as was longer sleep duration (> 8 h) (OR: 0.2, 95% CI: [0.1–1.0], p = 0.04). Conclusion: Our study estimates the prevalence and severity of self-reported depressive symptoms among airline pilots in Saudi Arabia, surpassing global estimates. The identified factors, including lack of regular exercise, short sleep duration, and insufficient rest between flights, underscore the complex mental health challenges faced by pilots in this region. Addressing these issues is crucial not only for pilot well-being but also for flight safety. © The Author(s) 2024."

These attacks not only jeopardize global security but also have severe public health repercussions, leading to widespread casualties and psychological distress. Methods This study conducted a comprehensive retrospective analysis using data from the Global Terrorism Database to explore the patterns, frequencies, and impacts of terrorist attacks on the aviation sector worldwide. The analysis spanned incidents from 1970 to 2020, focusing on attack types, affected regions, and the direct and indirect health consequences arising from these incidents. Results Over the 50-year period, the study identified 1183 terrorist attacks targeting the aviation sector. Bombings and explosions emerged as the most common and deadliest forms of attack, responsible for the majority of fatalities and injuries. The data also highlighted significant regional disparities, with certain areas experiencing higher frequencies of attacks and more severe outcomes. Notably, North America bore a disproportionately high number of fatalities, primarily due to the events of September 11, 2001. Conclusions The findings emphasize the ongoing and evolving threat of terrorism in the aviation industry, underscoring the critical need for a proactive and comprehensive approach to security and public health preparedness. Future strategies should prioritize the integration of advanced technological solutions, enhanced international cooperation, and thorough public health planning to mitigate the impact of terrorist attacks on aviation effectively. © The Author(s), 2024.

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been widely utilised to understand the adoption of various technologies across industries. However, its application within the context of aviation risk assessment requires nuanced considerations due to the unique operational environment and stringent safety requirements. This paper applies the TAM model to aviation safety risk assessment methods. A review of the literature on TAM and its adaptations in aviation risk assessment is carried out. Drawing from interdisciplinary insights in psychology, human factors, and aviation safety, this paper proposes constructs that may enhance the TAM framework to improve its applicability to the aviation industry. This study explores key areas including individual versus organisational acceptance of technology, procurement and operational costs, trust in technology, system complexity and security issues. These factors are examined to provide a comprehensive understanding of technology acceptance within aviation risk assessment practices. By proposing an expansion of the TAM framework, this paper aims to offer valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and regulators involved in aviation safety management and technology integration efforts. © 2024 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

Their evolution reflects the realization over time that blaming people, chasing errors, fixing one-offs, and regulation would not create the desired patient safety. In Safety-0, the oldest framework, harm events arise from clinician failure; event prevention relies on better staffing, education, and basic standards. In Safety-1, used by hospitals, harm events arise from individual and/or system failures. Safety is improved through analytics, workplace culture, high reliability principles, technology, and quality improvement. Safety-2 emphasizes clinicians' adaptability to prevent harm events in an everchanging environment, using resilience engineering principles. Safety-3, used by aviation, adds system design and control elements to Safety-1 and Safety-2, deploying human factors, design-thinking, and operational control or feedback to prevent and respond to harm events. Safety-3 represents a potential way for anesthesia and perioperative care to become safer. © 2024 American Society of Anesthesiologists. All Rights Reserved.

"Assessment of cognitive workload using simultaneous EEG and fNIRS: A comparison of feature combinations","2024","Computers and Electrical Engineering","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203270009&partnerID=40&md5=4bfdc564a2049cca5950c3ceb3724b31","The assessment of cognitive workload is a critical component in evaluating mental activity. It is essential in psychology, especially in professions with heightened cognitive demands, such as aviation and surgery. Even marginal improvements in workload assessment can substantially enhance safety and overall performance. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of cognitive workload assessment by employing a combined EEG+fNIRS approach with a minimal number of features. The Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) was applied to signals from EEG and fNIRS to extract relevant features. TQWT was chosen for its ability to adapt to the oscillatory behavior of the signal, and the features extracted from the transform facilitated the differentiation between different signal classes. This study introduced six proposed approaches, with the first focusing on EEG signals, the second on fNIRS signals, and the subsequent three to six approaches involving combinations of these two signals. Features evaluation highlighted the pivotal role of channels related to the frontal region and sub-bands associated with alpha and theta rhythms in EEG signals. Additionally, the very low-frequency range and the primary undecomposed signal in fNIRS signals contributed significantly to cognitive workload classification. The classification results demonstrated the efficacy of combining EEG and fNIRS signals in cognitive workload detection, providing higher accuracy than single-signal approaches. Compared to other feature combination approaches, the proposed approach based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) with a linear SVM classifier achieved superior accuracy across all investigated cognitive workload levels, with accuracies of 99.6 %, 99.4 %, 98.9 %, and 97.5 % for the 0-back vs. 3-back, 0-back vs. 2-back, 2-back vs. 3-back, and 0-back vs. 2-back vs. 3-back comparisons, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

HFACS is a system-based analysis method for investigating the causal factors associated with accidents and incidents and has previously been used to reliably and systematically identify active and latent failures associated with both military and general aviation accidents. Whilst HFACS has previously been applied to UAV accidents, the last known application was conducted in 2014. Using reports retrieved from nine accident investigation organisations’ databases, causal factors were coded against unsafe acts, preconditions, and failures at the supervisory, organisational, and environmental levels. Causal factors were assessed on 77 medium or large UAV mishaps/accidents that occurred over a 12-year period up to 2024. 42 mishap reports were deemed to involve a human factor as a causal factor. A large proportion of the mishaps contained factors attributed to Decision Errors at level 1 (Unsafe Acts) which was found to be associated with both the Technological Environment and Adverse Mental State at level 2 (Pre-conditions). Causal factors were identified at each of the other 3 levels (Supervisory, Organisational and External) with a number of emergent associations between causal factors. These data provide support for the identification and development of interventions aimed at improving the safety of organisations and advice of regulators for Uncrewed Air Systems. © 2024"

Investigations of failures consistently highlight how key employees behaved in (perhaps unintentionally) unethical ways that de-prioritized safety, such as investing fewer resources in safety (vs. other priorities) over time. Drawing on these investigations, we suggest a previously underexplored theme could explain why organizational failures persist and why employees did not “see” the potential for their behaviors to cause harm to others: Employees were distanced from where the harm eventually occurred, either in terms of space (e.g., being located miles away from the job site) or time (e.g., making decisions that would not have impacts for months or years). We use construal level theory to investigate how the way employees construe where work occurs—defined as work context construal—influences perceptions of harm and the ethical framing of risk-mitigating behaviors. We hypothesize that high-level (abstract) work context construals (vs. low-level, concrete ones) reduce perceptions of potential harm which, in turn, leads to framing risk-mitigating behaviors as less of an ethical obligation. Six studies—a correlational survey of aviation employees (Study 1), field experiments with offshore drilling employees (Study 2A) and health care workers (Study 2B), a preregistered experiment with nurses (Study 3), and two supplemental studies (Studies 4A/B)—support our hypotheses. We discuss implications of this research for understanding organizational failures, particularly in a world where technology increasingly enables employees to monitor complex and high-risk work occurring many miles away, or on the other side of the world. © 2024 American Psychological Association"

Pilot self-reported responses in scenarios were standardized by obtaining z scores of startle, surprise, stress, and mental workload. Only trait anxiety was found to be significantly positively correlated with stress. No significant effects of AOD, AOF, or flight hours were found on pilots responses.

Fairness can be seen as a fundamental aspect potentially reducing annoyance reactions. This study delves into the concept of fairness within airport management, drawing on research from fields such as social and organizational psychology. It specifically examines the viewpoint of noise-affected residents, offering insights into their perception of fairness in regard to airport management. The research involved focus group discussions and in-depth interviews at three different European airports in Germany and France. These sessions were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Participants were surveyed based on their exposure to lower (≤55 dB L<inf>den</inf>) and higher (>55 dB L<inf>den</inf>) levels of aircraft noise. The findings indicate that distributive, procedural, informational, and interpersonal fairness are viewed as important elements for fostering a fair and neighborly relationship with the airport. Residents emphasized the importance of receiving adequate compensation for the disadvantages they incur due to their proximity to the airport, such as aircraft noise-related sleep disturbance. Additionally, residents expressed the need for earnest inclusion in the decision-making processes, as well as access transparent information. Additional focus group discussions were conducted to validate the results and to gather input from affected residents, aiming to establish a fair and neighborly relationship. Based on these insights, recommendations are formulated for airport managers from the perspective of the affected residents, emphasizing the aim of fostering a fair and neighborly relationship. © 2024 The Author(s)"

This illusory self-motion is operationally important for aviation, particularly military aviation, since vection is a dramatic example of spatial disorientation (SD), which is an individual's failure to correctly sense the aircraft's position, motion, and/or attitude with respect to the fixed coordinate system of the Earth's surface and its gravitational vertical. Notably, SD is a major cause of fatal aviation mishaps, and the visual system is particularly prone to provoking vection. This article describes the Virtual Reality Vection System (VRVS), which uses computer-controlled virtual reality technology to induce vection under controlled conditions for training, demonstration, testing, and research. Materials and Methods: The VRVS enables the precise specification of the number and appearance of visual stimulus elements intended to generate vection, including photorealistic images. The VRVS can present visual stimuli on any OpenXR-capable virtual reality headset. The VRVS currently records 2 types of behavioral responses, button presses to indicate the presence and duration of vection and the voltage of a handheld linear potentiometer to indicate the presence, duration, and magnitude of vection. Results: An approved test plan helped guide, organize, document, and validate the VRVS during its development. Under this plan, a pair of tests guided hardware and software development of the VRVS system. Although the first test verified the ability of the VRVS to generate and measure vection, it also demonstrated that the VRVS can quickly manipulate the visual stimuli from one trial to the next so that the VRVS can support complex experimental designs. The second test used these capabilities to verify that the VRVS can characterize vection in a more analytic fashion using a masking paradigm. Specifically, the test assessed whether random stimulus elements injected into the vection-inducing stimulus disrupted vection in a quantifiable fashion. This work opens the door to studies that characterize the necessary and sufficient visual elements for vection-based SD. Discussion: The VRVS is currently used to research, develop, test, and evaluate mitigation strategies targeting vection-related SD in degraded visual environments. Similarly, the VRVS is supporting research to develop methods to predict individual differences in visually induced motion sickness susceptibilities. The VRVS is currently being integrated with a precision motor-controlled rotating Barany chair for multisensory studies. It should be noted that since the VRVS was developed to support United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory projects, it is an Army product representing government intellectual property and may be freely available to other government institutions. © 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States."

Wake vortices, generated by jet aircraft, pose a significant hazard to trailing or crossing aircrafts. Despite existing separation rules, incidents involving WVEs continue to occur, especially affecting smaller aircrafts like business jets, resulting in aircraft upsets and occasional cabin injuries. To address these challenges, the study focused on developing and validating an alert system that can be presented to air traffic controllers, enabling them to warn flight crews. This empowers the flight crews to either avoid the wake vortex or secure the cabin to prevent injuries. The research employed a multidimensional approach including an analysis of human performance and human factors (HF) issues to determine the potential impact of the alert on pilots' roles, tasks, and mental states. It also utilizes Human Assurance Levels (HALs) to evaluate the necessary human factors support based on the safety criticality of the new system. Realistic flight simulations were conducted to collect data of pilots' behavioural, subjective and neurophysiological responses during WVEs. The data allowed for an objective evaluation of the WVA impact on pilots' operation, behaviour and mental states (mental workload, stress levels and arousal). In particular, the results highlighted the effectiveness of the alert system in facilitating pilots' preparation, awareness and crew resource management (CRM). The results also highlighted the importance of avionics able to enhance aviation safety and reducing risks associated with wake vortex encounters. In particular, we demonstrated how providing timely information and improving situational awareness, the WVA will minimize the occurrence of WVEs and contribute to safer aviation operations. © 2024 The Authors"

Maintaining quality of life (QoL) is vital for airline crews because they work in a special environment, where they are responsible for the passengers’ safety. This study aims to closely investigate factors affecting the QoL of airline crews, including post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey, comprising 167 crews. Findings: Age-specific significant differences were observed in social, overall, and total QoL scores. The physical domain QoL was significantly higher in the cockpit crews than that in the cabin crews. Significant differences were found in psychological and overall QoL depending on years of continuous service. Social domain and environmental QoL were lower in those who had no symptoms after being diagnosed with COVID-19 than in those who were symptomatic. Among the participants, 4.2% had post-COVID-19 syndrome, indicating significant differences in the physical domain, depending on whether they exhibit post-COVID-19 syndrome. Conclusion: It is urgent to develop measures to increase the QoL of airline crews, investigate post-COVID-19 syndrome before returning to work, and develop strategies to manage it. Application to practice: The QoL among airline crews differed not only by the demographic characteristics of the participants but also by the presence of symptoms during COVID-19 diagnosis and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Higher QoL among airline crews is associated with the safety of both airline crews and passengers. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a systematic management protocol for airline crews returning to work after following COVID-19 infection. © 2024 The Author(s)."

Despite staffing shortages, air traffic control remains a safety-critical environment where controllers must continue to perform while shouldering intensive cognitive demands and high levels of responsibility (Imroz et al., 2022; Maxwell, 1986; Raduntz et al., 2021). With studies showing that high-stress levels, shift work, long hours, and inadequate recovery time can result in mental health disorders, the mental health status of air traffic controllers should be evaluated to ensure the continued safety of the National Airspace System (Ericsson et al., 2021; Lee & Park, 2022; Skypalova et al., 2022).

This study aims to investigate the EEG characteristics of pilots, refine training assessment methodologies, and bolster flight safety measures. The collected EEG signals underwent initial preprocessing. The EEG characteristic analysis was performed during left and right turns, involving the calculation of the energy ratio of beta waves and Shannon entropy. The psychological workload of pilots during different flight phases was quantified as well. Based on the EEG characteristics, the pilots’ psychological workload was classified through the use of a support vector machine (SVM). The study results showed significant changes in the energy ratio of beta waves and Shannon entropy during left and right turns compared to the cruising phase. Additionally, the pilots’ psychological workload was found to have increased during these turning phases. Using support vector machines to detect the pilots’ psychological workload, the classification accuracy for the training set was 98.92%, while for the test set, it was 93.67%.

"Ramp-up in the air: Impairing or repairing aviation crews’ working conditions? A mixed-methods survey study on working conditions, health, and safety among cabin crew and pilots in Europe","2024","Journal of Air Transport Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198325384&partnerID=40&md5=c6a775c748819880571a4f044cc2ea79","Introduction: Organizational changes, such as downsizing, can have profound implications for organizations, working conditions, and individual well-being. Similarly, rapid expansion also carries potential risks to individual health. During the Covid-19 pandemic, airlines experienced substantial organizational changes, such as downsizing and furloughs, followed by rapid expansion during the ramp-up phase of flying, posing risks to the health and safety of aviation personnel in the new post-pandemic aviation landscape. Method: This cross-sectional and mixed-method survey study aimed to identify what post-pandemic challenges pilots (N = 6379) and cabin crew (N = 2679) face regarding working conditions, health, and flight safety. Results: The results indicate deteriorated working conditions, health, and perceived safety among crew in the new aviation landscape. One in two cabin crew and one in three pilots report a decline in mental health. Whilst most pilots and cabin crew report no change in overall safety, 29% of cabin crew and 36% of surveyed pilots state that safety has deteriorated since the onset of the pandemic. This development is connected to an increased sense of industry instability, job insecurity, imbalanced job design, and management distrust among aviation crew. Furthermore, the uncertainties surrounding the industry have not only impacted job security and induced job-related worry but have also intensified operational pressures, with perceived impacts on flight and passenger safety. Conclusion: The organizational framework, e.g., financial pressures, may have an effect on safety, either directly or indirectly by financial worry impeding crew performance. Hence, safety cannot be examined in isolation from employee health but must be understood in relation to the complex dynamics and competing objectives within aviation. Further, crew experiences across Europe are largely homogeneous, suggesting that identified risks may not be airline specific. Therefore, it is important to further examine the industry framework for inherent risk factors that could impact employee health and flight safety. © 2024 The Authors"

The adverse effects of mental health disorders on their flight performance pose a particular safety risk, especially in sudden unexpected startle situations. Therefore, the early detection, prediction and prevention of mental health deterioration in pilots and ATCs, particularly among those at high risk, are crucial to minimize potential air crash incidents caused by human factors. Recent research in artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates the potential of machine and deep learning, edge and cloud computing, virtual reality and wearable multimodal physiological sensors for monitoring and predicting mental health disorders. Longitudinal monitoring and analysis of pilots’ and ATCs physiological, cognitive and behavioral states could help predict individuals at risk of undisclosed or emerging mental health disorders. Utilizing AI tools and methodologies to identify and select these individuals for preventive mental health training and interventions could be a promising and effective approach to preventing potential air crash accidents attributed to human factors and related mental health problems. Based on these insights, the article advocates for the design of a multidisciplinary mental healthcare ecosystem in modern aviation using AI tools and technologies, to foster more efficient and effective mental health management, thereby enhancing flight safety and security standards. This proposed ecosystem requires the collaboration of multidisciplinary experts, including psychologists, neuroscientists, physiologists, psychiatrists, etc. to address these challenges in modern aviation. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

OBJECTIVE To examine the association between dietary rhythms and the mental health condition of shift workers, specifically airline crew members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected from the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China, an ongoing large-scale health survey of pilots, flight attendants, and air security officers employed by major airline companies in China. Participants aged 18 to 60 years were invited through text messages to complete a web-based survey. The data collection period was December 2022 to March 2023. Statistical analysis was performed from July 24, 2023, to April 12, 2024. EXPOSURE Data on timing of breakfast and dinner on workdays and rest days, daily time windows for food intake, and meal and eating jet lags were collected and calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the associations of anxiety and depression with meal timing, eating window time, meal jet lag (ie, delayed meals), and eating jet lag (ie, delayed eating). All models were adjusted for individual socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS Of the 22 617 participants (median [IQR] age, 29.1 [26.3-33.7] years; 13 712 males [60.6%]), 1755 (7.8%) had anxiety and 2768 (12.2%) had depression. After controlling for confounding factors, having dinner after 8 PM on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.05) and depression (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.78-2.27), compared with consuming dinner before 8 PM. Similar results were observed on night-shift days and rest days. An eating window of less than 12 hours was associated with reduced odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) and depression (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89) on morning-shift days; the results remained significant on rest days. Delayed dinner on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54) and depression (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). On night-shift days, delayed dinner was associated with higher odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and depression (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36). On morning-shift days, delayed eating rhythms were associated with higher odds of depression (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.61), whereas advanced eating rhythms were associated with lower odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that meal timing, long eating window, and meal jet lags were associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the need for interventions and supportive policies that help mitigate the adverse implications of shift work and irregular working hours for the mental health of shift workers. © 2024 American Medical Association.

This dangerous illusion can cause pilots to compensate by flying lower than intended, which can result in them crashing into the ground or obstacles in front of the runway. A common interpretation of the BHI is that it is a perceptual illusion, and two quantitative perception based theories have been proposed. The first theory was developed by Perrone (1983), and it assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to the loss of contextual information surrounding the runway, such as ground texture, during nighttime landing conditions. Adapted from work by Galanis et al. (1998) and Robinson et al. (2020), the second (eye-level) theory assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to loss of the horizon during nighttime landing conditions. Quantitative analyses of Perrone's theory suggest that the magnitude of the illusion should vary with runway width and length in nighttime conditions, but in daylight conditions there should be no illusion and no effect of runway width or length. Analyses of the eye-level theory predict no impact of runway width or length for any condition. Across two empirical laboratory studies, we do demonstrate a BHI for nighttime evaluations of descent angle, but the data do not support either theory. Thus, the two algorithms analyzed here are not sufficient to explain the BHI; and the BHI may reflect general disorientation due to limited information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The restrictive nature of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and perceived negative consequences of seeking mental health treatment further exacerbates these challenges. This study examined the efficacy of performance-based acceptance and commitment training (ACT) in enhancing psychological flexibility, resilience, and mental well-being as well as improving FAA practical examination outcomes among collegiate flight training students. A randomized controlled trial was used to compare outcomes between students receiving a six-week ACT intervention (n = 23) and a control group (n = 27). The planned sample size of 100 was not achieved, thus, the analyses were underpowered and should be cautiously interpreted. Results indicate significant improvements among intervention participants in anxiety sensitivity (g = 0.43) and psychological flexibility (g = 0.58) compared to those in the control group. However, no significant differences in examination pass rates or time to completion were found between groups. To examine idiographic differences, individual change scores were plotted, demonstrating the heterogeneity of effects between participants. Potential explanations for the intervention's lack of effect on practical exam performance are discussed and suggestions are given to improve future performance-based interventions in this unique context. © 2024 Association for Contextual Behavioral Science"

It is, therefore, vital to explore the factors associated with AMT safety behaviors and the underlying mechanisms. This study, drawing on self-determination theory and the broaden-and-build theory, explores the relationship between workplace well-being (WWB) and AMT safety behaviors within the framework of positive psychology. A sample of 593 Chinese AMTs (561 males and 32 females; average age = 27.28, SD = 3.73) anonymously completed questionnaires on demographic variables, WWB, work engagement, safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL), and safety behavior. We utilized SPSS 26.0 and the PROCESS macro (models 4 and 7), along with Amos 24.0, to conduct an empirical test of a moderated mediation model elucidating the relationship between WWB and safety behavior. The findings reveal a positive association between WWB and AMT safety behaviors, with work engagement acting as a partial mediator. Furthermore, SSTL was found to negatively moderate the positive association between WWB and work engagement, as well as the association between WWB and safety behavior through work engagement. Notably, the positive association between WWB and work engagement, and thus safety behavior, becomes more pronounced under lower SSTL conditions. In conclusion, this study makes theoretical contributions and offers practical insights for improving aircraft maintenance safety management practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Background: Learning about subjective workload is important for assessing the impact of a pilot's work environment on their performance in the cockpit. This is an important element of flight safety and includes the prevention of aviation accidents. Methods: The study included 146 military pilots that fly the following aircrafts: flying fast-jet (21), fixed-wing (24), and rotary-wing (101). The NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to assess workload and pilots were asked to determine the level of workload resulting from flying under the following conditions: daytime flight (VFR), night-vision flight performed under Night Visual Flight Rules (NVFR), and night-vision flight using night-vision goggles (NVGs). Results: The highest level of workload was consistently attributed to flights performed under NVG conditions. NVFR conditions were rated as the most burdensome, while VFR conditions were rated as the least burdensome. Fast-jet pilots rated their mental performance and effort workload as significantly higher than pilots of other aircrafts. Conclusion: Pilots’ perceived workload is influenced by both flight conditions and the type of aircraft they fly. Workload knowledge is important for flight safety and should be taken into account during training and flight-task planning. Application: The results of our study can be useful both in flight training and in work on the effectiveness of the human-machine interface. Awareness of one's own limitations due to the work environment can help improve flight safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Utilizing a qualitative approach and collecting data from 11 ARFF professionals using semi-structured interviews, this study delves into an exploration of factors that contribute to psychological resilience among Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel stationed at State Airports, a group operating under emergency circumstances within the aviation industry. The investigation reveals three overarching themes: micro-level personal factors, meso-level organizational factors, and macro-level environmental/societal factors. Key findings reveal that micro-level personal factors, including personality traits and individual coping mechanisms, significantly influence ARFF professionals’ psychological resilience. Encompassing leadership quality and team dynamics, meso-level organizational factors have emerged as crucial contributors to resilience. Finally, macro-level environmental/societal factors, such as social support networks and the broader emergency preparedness context, have been identified as integral elements shaping psychological resilience. This qualitative approach, designed to capture the nuanced experiences and perceptions of ARFF professionals through a multi-level exploration of psychological resilience, extends its implications to the realms of aviation and emergency response. Micro-level considerations illuminate the significance of human resources-related decisions, such as recruitment and training, in fortifying ARFF professionals’ resilience. Meso-level considerations provide evidence for the impactful role of leadership and effective safety measures in promoting resilience. Macro-level considerations underscore the importance of environmental design and spillover effects, such as family support, in shaping resilience. An understanding of the factors that contribute to psychological resilience may be directly transferable to the creation of support mechanisms and targeted interventions and may also be directly transferable to assist emergency response teams in the aviation sector. © The Author(s) 2024."

The military services' retention efforts have typically utilized a combination of high continuation pays and longer service commitments of up to 10 years following initial training. One area that the services have overlooked in their attempts to retain senior aviators is quantifying and reducing medical disqualifications. Much as aging aircraft require increasing maintenance to retain full operational capability, so may pilots and other aircrew members. Materials and Methods: This article reports on a prospectively collected cross-sectional research study evaluating the medical status of senior aviation personnel who reported being considered or selected for command. The study was deemed exempt from human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board and a waiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was granted. The study, which collected data at the Pentagon Flight Medical Clinic over 1 year, used a chart review of routine medical encounters and flight physicals to collect descriptive data. The goals of the study were to establish the prevalence of medically disqualifying conditions, assess the association between disqualifying conditions and age, and generate hypotheses for further research. Logistic regression of waiver need was performed for variables including prior waivers, waiver count, service, platform, age, and gender. ANOVA of readiness percentages vs. DoD targets were assessed between the services individually and in aggregate. Results: The study demonstrated medical readiness rates among command-eligible senior aviators ranging from 74% for the Air Force to 40% for the Army with the Navy and Marine Corps in the middle. The sample was insufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in readiness between the services; however, the population as a whole was significantly below the DoD's readiness target of >90% (P =. 000). Conclusions: None of the services met the DoD minimum readiness target of 90%. Markedly higher readiness was observed in the Air Force, the only service with a medical screening incorporated into its command selection process, but this difference was not statistically significant. Waivers increased with age and musculoskeletal concerns were common. A larger prospective cohort study should be considered to further elucidate and confirm the findings of this study. If further research confirms these findings, consideration should be made of screening command applicants for medical readiness. © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

Pilots will face additional burdens in such an environment, given the increasing number of factors that they must simultaneously consider while completing their work activities. Therefore, care and attention must be paid to the mental workload (MWL) experienced by operating pilots. If left unaddressed, a state of mental overload could affect the pilot’s ability to complete his or her work activities in a safe and correct manner. This study examines the impact of two different cockpit display interfaces (CDIs), the Steam Gauge panel and the G1000 Glass panel, on novice pilots’ MWL and situational awareness (SA) in a flight simulator-based setting. A combination of objective (EEG and HRV) and subjective (NASA-TLX) assessments is used to assess novice pilots’ cognitive states during this study. Our results indicate that the gauge design of the CDI affects novice pilots’ SA and MWL, with the G1000 Glass panel being more effective in reducing the MWL and improving SA compared with the Steam Gauge panel. The results of this study have implications for the design of future flight deck interfaces and the training of future pilots. © 2024 by the authors."

Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

A total of 198 civil aviation pilots and 804 other civil aviation practitioners were recruited to complete surveys on mindfulness, SCL-90, job burnout, core self-evaluation, and psychological resilience. The network relationship between trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation was constructed. The results showed that trait mindfulness played an important role in the psychological adaptation network of civil aviation employees. Specifically, trait mindfulness was negatively correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and emotional exhaustion, and positively correlated with core self-evaluation. However, no significant difference was found in trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation network between pilots and non-pilots. These findings show that mindfulness has a unique positive effect on the psychological adaptation of civil aviation personnel. Specifically, the mindfulness trait may alleviate compulsive symptoms or reduce emotional exhaustion, enabling airline personnel to maintain a good self-evaluation. At the same time, the role of mindfulness traits in the network is similar, indicating that the positive role of mindfulness intervention in civil aviation may be universal. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

"Investigating aviation safety factors and proposed conceptual model for safety behaviors among Thai flight crews: A qualitative approach","2024","Kasetsart Journal of Social Sciences","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195145737&partnerID=40&md5=fb7f1321d60d9483cd5480335adc3cfe","This study aims to answer behavioral safety questions regarding influential factors and relationship among those factors relating to Thai flight crews’ safety behaviors, and the objective of this study is to develop a proposed hypotheses relating to factors affecting Thai flight crews’ safety behaviors for future research. Based on a sample of 21 flight crews and executives in Thailand, the result found that influential factors relating to Thai flight crew safety behaviors were organizational safety climate, fleet safety climate, aviation safety knowledge, aviation psychological safety and flight crews’ safety attitudes and personalities. Flight time was considered as a typical job experience and did not directly reflect the safety behaviors among flight crews. What reflected safety behaviors among flight crews were their own safety attitudes and personalities. Therefore, it would be proposed that organizational safety climate, fleet safety climate and flight attitudes and personalities played antecedent roles and aviation safety knowledge and aviation psychological safety played mediating roles. Future studies can possibly use the result from this study to formulate further hypotheses and apply the proposed conceptual model for quantitative analysis. © 2024 Kasetsart University."
"Exploring AAM Acceptance in Tourism: Environmental Consciousness’s Influence on Hedonic Motivation and Intention to Use","2024","Sustainability (Switzerland)","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191411266&partnerID=40&md5=728338a16d57992f228e7370f006fb5c","Tourist destinations thrive on sustainable development. Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, representing energy-efficient advancements in aviation that are pivotal to advanced air mobility (AAM), have garnered attention. Yet, the discourse on eVTOLs’ role in tourism remains scant. This study, drawing from 450 samples in the Mogan Mountain Scenic Area, introduces the AAM-tourism acceptance model (ATAM). It integrates the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM) theoretical frameworks, incorporating environmental consciousness, perceived safety, hedonic motivation, and personal innovativeness, assessing their influence on tourists’ eVTOL usage intention through a structural equation model (SEM). The results reveal that environmental consciousness significantly impacts hedonic motivation and perceived usefulness, driving eVTOL adoption. Furthermore, personal innovativeness influences intention through hedonic motivation and perceived behavioral control. Therefore, environmental consciousness and hedonic motivation align deeply with eVTOL attributes, both significantly positively influencing intention to use. Thus, the study validates eVTOL’s viability in tourism and its potential for sectoral expansion. Moreover, it offers insights into how psychological factors shape eVTOL adoption, guiding the promotion of eVTOL sightseeing services and informing research on AAM acceptance across various domains. © 2024 by the authors."

The influence of representational gravity can lead to systematic errors during uniform linear motion. However, it remains unclear whether representational gravity during motion can affect spatial orientation. In this study, college students from Xi’an, China were recruited to participate in an experiment based on the Spatial Visualization Dynamic Test. We compared the accuracy of spatial orientation estimation and eye movement indices when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the lower right versus when it was in the upper right. The results revealed that individuals were prone to overestimate the adjustment angle when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the lower right, and underestimate the adjustment angle when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the upper right; the average pupil size was significantly larger when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the lower right than that when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the upper right. In conclusion, spatial orientation in motion was influenced by representational gravity, and when representational gravity aligned with the main direction of spatial orientation, it led to increased cognitive resource consumption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

Background: The ability to control actions is a central skill to properly behave in complex environments. Increased levels of response preparation are associated with reduced response times, but how they directly affect the ability to control actions is not well explored. We investigated how the response preparation affects the ability to control the generation of actions in the context of a stop selective task. Method: Participants performed a visuo-motor stop selective task. Results: We found that an increased level of response preparation reduced the ability to control actions. In the condition with high preparation, we observed shorter response times and increased probability of wrong responses to a request to stop, compared to a condition with a lower level of preparation. Conclusion: We demonstrated that high response preparation hinders action control. Application: Understanding the cognitive factors that affect the ability to properly control actions is crucial to develop devices that can be exploited in different contexts such as the aviation, industrial, and military. We demonstrated that subjects’ response preparation is a key factor influencing their ability to flexibly control their reaction to different stimuli. This study offers a suitable paradigm that can be used to investigate which system features in a controlled task promote an optimal balance between response speed and error rate. © 2022, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Methods A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the reasons for disqualification of 4 542 junior high school male graduates who applied for the Air Force Youth Aviation School and undertook neuropsychiatric examination from 2018 to 2022. The yearly detection rates of the top 5 reasons of disqualification in neuropsychiatry were compared. Results The overall disqualification rate in neuropsychiatry during medical selection at Shijiazhuang Station of the Air Force Youth Aviation School from 2018 to 2022 showed an upward trend (χ2=8.98, P=0.003). The top 5 reasons were family genetic history (0.88%), artificial urticaria (0.46%), syncope history (0.35%), coma history (0.35%), and pre-syncope status (0.35%). The detection rates of family genetic history and pre-syncope status in adolescents showed an overall growing trend, and the differences were significant (χ2=7.41, 11.12, P=0.007, 0.001); the detection rate of artificial urticaria showed an overall decline trend, with a significant difference (χ2=6.33, P=0.012). There was no significant change in the detection rates of syncope history and coma history (P>0.05). Conclusions The trend changes on the detection rates of family genetic history, pre-syncope status and artificial urticarial may related to the doctor's skill and comprehensiveness in disease history inquiry.

"Personality traits changes in the training process of Chinese airline transport pilots","2024","Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187549188&partnerID=40&md5=997506df63e360227c06281a90fd035d","OBJECTIVE: To study the personality changes of Chinese airline transport pilots in the training process from cadets to captains. METHODS: In This paper, we used the Cattell 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) to track and record the personality traits of 200 students majoring in flight technology and 200 'college graduates to pilot' in five different periods from the beginning of aviation theory training to becoming captains. RESULTS: Before the aviation theory training, for the 16 factors of 16PF, there was a significant difference in 11 factors (including Warmth (A), Reasoning (B), etc.) between the students majoring in flight technology and 'college graduates to pilot' (p< 0.05). After the completion of theory training, there were only four factors (Sensitivity (I), Openness to Change (Q1), Self Reliance (Q2) and Perfectionism (Q3) (p< 0.05) between the students majoring in flight technology and 'college graduates to pilot', then after the flight training, there is no significant difference between them. When they became captains, compared with when they were flying cadets, 13 factors of students majoring in flight technology and 7 factors of 'college graduates to pilot' had changed significantly. From the perspective of the growth of flying cadets, in the process of becoming a captain, there are three stages that have a great influence on the personality of the participants. The first stage is the university study. The second stage is the flight training, and the third stage is the copilot growing into a captain. CONCLUSION: During the process of a pilot growing from a cadet to a captain, his or her personality is constantly developing and changing, and on the whole, develops towards a personality direction conducive to flight safety. In particular, when a copilot grows into a captain, the personality traits of a qualified airline pilot, including Emotional Stablity (C), Rule-Consciousness (G), Social Boldness (H), Privateness (N), Self-Reliance (Q2), etc., have been greatly strengthened at this stage. © 2024-IOS Press.

The primary focus was on identifying factors linked to pilots' Job Satisfaction differentiations over the time course of the pandemic, and proposing measures to mitigate their negative effects. Survey Job Satisfaction data were collected from 203 pilots during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021, and were subsequently measured in a quasi-identical sample of 205 pilots after the pandemic in May 2023. During the pandemic, the results indicate that airline pilots experienced an acute decrease in Job Satisfaction due to the disruptive nature of COVID-19. This decline was primarily attributed to factors such as pay cuts and reduced promotion prospects, which consequently resulted in feelings of limited job security and future uncertainty. Importantly, a substantial recovery of airline pilots JS was observed following the end of the pandemic. In contrast, military pilots' levels remained relatively constant over the duration of the pandemic, as military organizations typically received government provided financial security. To improve commercial sustainability, it is recommended that airline companies enhance their preparedness for future crises by minimizing the financial impact experienced by pilots. Additionally, effective communication strategies should be implemented to address and alleviate uncertainty among pilots. It is crucial to prevent adverse psychological conditions among pilots, as they play a critical role in maintaining flight safety. © 2024 The Authors"

Since multisensory stimulation can enhance the sense of presence in a virtual environment, the present study compared virtual reality exposure with and without vibrotactile cues to determine its contribution to the realism of the virtual experience. Methods: A repeated measures design was used. Thirty-one participants were exposed to two experimental conditions with a minimum of a one-week interval between them: one in which participants were exposed to the virtual environment with vibrotactile cues (smart chair, SC), and another in which participants were exposed to the virtual environment without vibrotactile cues (ordinary chair, OC). The administration order of both conditions was counterbalanced to avoid possible order effects. Results: Participants felt higher levels of sense of presence when using the SC than the OC. However, the addition of vibrotactile stimulation partially influenced experienced anxiety. Some personality traits were also associated with participants’ sense of presence and anxiety responses during the exposure. Limitations: The sample size was smaller than required. Moreover, only self-reported measures were used. Finally, a roller coaster instead of an airplane scenario was used for the exposure, which might not have been suitable enough for provoking anxiety in participants with FoF. Conclusions: Vibrotactile cues enhanced the sense of presence. However, the addition of vibrotactile stimulation did not have a consistent effect on anxiety experienced during exposure. Therefore, the benefits of incorporating vibrotactile cues in virtual reality environments for exposure therapy are not clear. © 2023 The Authors"

The researchers conducted a mixed methods study to identify a common knowledge base of collegiate flight students’ perceptions and realities related to depression and anxiety. Study participants were bachelor's degree seeking flight students from University Aviation Association (UAA) member collegiate flight programs. The received responses were analysed through the perspective of four research questions. In summary, gathered responses indicated that students believe there is a perceived benefit to not disclosing or ignoring mental health and fitness issues, safeguarding their own mental health is one of their primary concerns, and there is a considerable number who would leave the aviation industry if they could no longer fly. Additionally, most students agree that change would be beneficial as it relates to the current FAA medical certification process. © 2024, University Aviation Association. All rights reserved."
"The Influence of Airport Service Quality on Air Travel Choices: A Case Study of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; 机场服务质量对航空出行选择行为的影响-以粤港澳大湾区为例","2024","Tropical Geography","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185300320&partnerID=40&md5=2aaeab9cf34130265277cfbdb6dbb53e","High-quality air service is important for achieving high-quality aviation development. As the primary customers of air travel services, passengers are the most important evaluators of the service. Therefore, research on their air travel choices is key for promoting the coordination of multi-airport regions. Based on stochastic utility psychological perception theories, this study discusses the impact of the key dimension of airport service quality on air travel choices using the structural equation model-logit model. The results show that air travel choice is not a simple linear extension of behavioral intentions as there are two key dimensions of airport service quality: First, mandatory service processing is inevitably the most time-consuming and tedious process for passengers at airports. This waiting time is perceived as a sign of low airport service capability, whereas the level and quality of service provided by staff in this process is an intangible factor for passengers. This in turn affects the level of passengers' ratings of airport services, especially for business travelers. Therefore, airports need to recognize the time and resource constraints of passengers and work with airlines to streamline the check-in process, ensure security control, and reduce waiting time. One solution is to use shared self-service devices or automated robots that allow any passenger of any airline or flight to check-in and check-out on the same device. Second, while facilities, equipment, and environment are not universal considerations for passengers, differences in passenger perceptions are evident between airport types. Within multi-airport regions, the facilities, equipment, and environment of major airports are above passengers' psychological expectations, while auxiliary or other airports need to pay more attention to this service, which illustrates that the improvement of airport service quality requires changes to unidimensional and monolithic thinking but also focus on passengers' overall perception of service experience from a multidimensional perspective, as well as consideration of the spatial and temporal characteristics of different airport types in the multi-airport region to make targeted improvements. Moreover, passengers do not have an obvious preference for particular airlines, but low-cost airlines still hold a certain appeal for passengers when they take off from regional airports, which also means that low-cost airlines ' entry into the market has anti-risk properties for regional airports. Within the limits of China's aviation controls, the presence of low-cost carriers can still improve the chances of an airport being chosen. Therefore, different airport types within the same multi-airport region often need to compete differently to achieve regional synergistic development. To enhance airport service quality, it is essential to fine tune service quality standards, based on airport's types. The improvement of airports' performance should include a phased integration of assessments of service experience settings. Airports should adopt differentiated spatial designs for their service functions based on the goal of airport integration, with a view to achieving optimal management at minimal cost while being able to effectively guide passengers in their air travel choices. © 2024 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

Yet, it is unclear whether such findings can be extended in less controlled setups. By employing air traffic controllers in a real aviation environment, we tested whether tasks with different levels of cognitive load can affect their timing behavior. Participants completed temporal production, verbal estimation, and passage of time judgments, while actively engaging in real flight control sessions. Subjective assessments of task demands, as well as physiological responses (cardiac and electrodermal activity) were also measured. Accuracy of the produced intervals was measured at two distinct phases of the flight (during low-load cruising vs. high-load landing) and under two different task load manipulations (controlling one vs. two helicopters and speaking in native vs. non-native language). Analysis of interval production accuracy showed that during the high-load landing phase significant overproductions were made, compared to the low-load cruising phase, and landing two helicopters led to greater overproductions compared to landing only one. The duration of the two-helicopter sessions was significantly overestimated compared to the single-helicopter ones, and the passage of time was felt significantly faster. Subjective assessments of workload were positively correlated with the temporal estimations and passage of time judgments, and skin responses were positively correlated with the produced intervals. Overall, our results are consistent with past research, suggesting that mental workload modulates time perception in complex, real-world environments, thus making timing behavior a reliable index of the workload changes. © 2023 The Authors"
"Impacts of travel bans and travel intention changes on aviation emissions due to Covid-19 pandemic","2024","Environment, Development and Sustainability","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147970417&partnerID=40&md5=0278334f0be5dbcb6cee76a5e81a4cb3","The Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected many sectors including aviation and travel. Travel bans and forced lockdowns prevented transportation activity, especially air travel. Accordingly, huge amounts of emission reductions occurred. On the other hand, travel restrictions are not the only cause of emissions reductions. Changing travel intention in the era of Covid-19 is another important factor that affects aviation emissions. This paper aims to investigate the Landing/Take-Off (LTO) emission changes at Turkish airports. An emission inventory has been implemented for the years 2019 and 2020 to reveal the impacts of Covid-19 on aviation emissions. Domestic, international, and cargo flights have been included in the inventory. According to the results, total emissions of SO<inf>2</inf>, CO<inf>2</inf>, CO, NOx, NMVOC, CH<inf>4</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O, and PM<inf>2.5</inf> have decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 by 49.8%, 49.7%, 41.0%, 52.6%, 40.0%, 33.8%, 49.8%, and 50.3%, respectively. Total CO<inf>2</inf> reductions in the Q2, Q3, and Q4 periods of 2020 compared to that of 2019 are 87%, 50% and 43%, respectively. Another aim of this paper is to find the underlying reasons for emission reductions. For Turkish airports, emission reductions have resulted from travel bans in Q2. After the relaxation of restrictions with the declaration of the “New Normal” in Turkey, flight traffic rebounded to a certain level but was lower than 2019 levels. Therefore, changing travel intention is the main cause of emission reductions in Q3 and Q4 of 2020. The results of this study contribute to both the areas of air pollution and tourism management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

Just culture requires mechanisms to eliminate fear and sanction but not accountability when reporting safety-related issues. Adopted in sectors such as aviation, just culture remains an underdeveloped field in the maritime sector. OBJECTIVE: This study explores how some pre-requisites for a just culture (i.e., ease of reporting, motivation to report, and trust) are perceived and potentially implemented by seafarers' and shipping company safety representatives in Indonesia. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data in an exploratory study involving eleven active seafarers and four safety managers from shipping companies in Indonesia. RESULTS: The conditions for ease of reporting seem present, at least on paper. Shipping companies receive one to two near-miss reports per month. However, incidents seem to be underreported. It appears that companies are unsuccessful in establishing the motivation and trust necessary to enhance safety event reporting. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the concept of a just culture is not well understood among certain Indonesian shipping companies. The main barriers to implementing a just culture relate to hierarchical structures in the industry, frequent crew changes, blame culture, and lack of anonymous reporting for safety concerns. © 2024 - IOS Press.

The research begins by categorizing types of mental health disorders and mental health conditions outlined in FAA Part 67 that can disqualify students from pursuing an aviation career. An essential area of the study is the examination of resources available to aviation flight departments and student pilots for aviation-related assistance on general mental health support. The study will be used to explore mental health awareness and the familiarity of mental health resources among students in UVU's aviation flight department. The study will further give insight into a student's tendency towards self-diagnosis, the reluctance to seek advice and information on mental health, and their comfort levels in approaching peers struggling with mental health challenges. The study results will be used to identify priorities and develop an action plan of best practices and resources available for providing support systems for aviation flight training departments.

Risk shift theory has been explored in behavioral psychology and teamwork literature and is defined as the propensity of teams to make riskier decisions when compared to individuals. However, the findings from previous work were based on participant responses to hypothetical, abstract thought problems. These previous tasks lacked attributes present in an operational domain, including complexity, accountability, realism, and measurable risk. This study sought to bridge this gap by investigating whether this risk shift phenomena occurs in an operational task. Humans often work in teams in these domains, and increasingly, humans are also working with agents. Thus, an evaluation was done to first establish the existence of risk shift in human-only teams in an operational setting. The study had one independent variable: decision-maker with two levels, individual and team. The task design involved an aviation dispatch task, where participants simulated the role of a flight dispatcher. Participants were responsible to make dispatch decisions on whether to divert, hold, or send 25 airplanes, while weighing the potential consequences of incurring policy violations based on the possibility of an approaching storm. Results from the study showed the absolute value of the shift was significantly different than zero. Additionally, a thematic analysis found that groups varied in their decision-making strategies, using approaches like deferring to an influential teammate, averaging decisions amongst teammates, and collaborating to come to a new team decision. Establishing operational HHT risk shift in a realistic scenario provides the foundation for future experiments to examine how humans and autonomous agents perform teaming tasks in dynamic contexts involving risk. © 2024 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

We aimed to find out whether reduced flight hours, fear of COVID-19, and other factors were associated with depression in flight attendants during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: T his cross-sectional study was conducted at the Directorate General Civil Aviation Medical Center Indonesia and Garuda Sentra Medika in 2022. We included flight attendants who were still employed before and after the start of the pandemic. Data were collected using several questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire-12 to screen for depression and Fear of COVID-19 for fear levels. RESULTS: We obtained data from 159 respondents, of whom 25.2% of them had depression. Multivariate analysis showed that the reduction of flight hours 1 yr after the start of the pandemic and fear of COVID-19 were found to significantly increase the likelihood of depression by 2.3 times and 3.9 times, respectively. DISCUSSION: During the pandemic, depression was found to be highly prevalent among flight attendants and was associated with the reduction of flight hours and fear of COVID-19. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."
"Real-Time Neurophysiological and Subjective Indices of Cognitive Engagement in High-Speed Flight","2024","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214186666&partnerID=40&md5=350b992979fad18f0c8a4767f6455c28","INTRODUCTION: Managing cognitive demand is critical for aviation safety. Yet, accurately assessing pilot workload during complex flight maneuvers remains challenging. this study evaluated an integrated methodology combining real-time cognitive engagement indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment and assess the reliability of physiological and subjective measures for monitoring operator state. METHODS: six experienced U.s. army rotary-wing pilots completed simulated high-workload flight scenarios like low-altitude, reconnaissance, and air threat avoidance maneuvers. continuous wireless electroencephalography (eeG), heart rate data, and subjective workload ratings were recorded during the flights. RESULTS: eeG engagement indices and heart rate variability metrics demonstrated reliable within-subject consistency across trials for individual pilots, with mean intraclass correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.59–0.69. Both measures exhibited synchronized fluctuations across pilots at key events, increasing during high workload segments and decreasing in lower demand periods. subjective ratings also showed good within-subject reliability, with mean intraclass correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.74–0.85. these findings underscore the reliability of our measurements, instilling confidence in the validity of our research. DISCUSSION: the findings of this study provide strong support for the feasibility of using a multi-measure approach that integrates eeG, heart rate variability, and subjective ratings. this approach can continuously monitor real-time cognitive workload fluctuations during simulated rotary-wing operations. While objective measures showed within-subject consistency, substantial between-subject variability highlights the importance of individualized neurocognitive profiling. the integration of neurophysiological, autonomic, subjective, and environmental data holds great promise for the future of pilot workload assessment despite the challenges posed by individual differences. © © by The Authors.

"Underreporting of Depression in Australian Commercial Pilots","2024","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214185512&partnerID=40&md5=78157afc22b098e366f42c92efa3d485","INTRODUCTION: Undiagnosed depression in the aviation industry can have catastrophic consequences such as aircraft-assisted suicide. Depression is often underreported, especially when subjects are aware they are reporting on depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether scores on a depression screening tool would vary if it was disguised as a “life stress” questionnaire in a sample of Australian commercial pilots. METHODS: A total of 109 subjects were assigned into either a “Life Stress” survey or a “Depression” survey, both containing the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales depression screening tool among other questions relating to either depression or stress to determine any variation in depression scores. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in which the covert group that completed a “life-stress” survey scored higher average depression scores than the control group completing an overt depression inventory. Prevalence of depression was consistent with the general population, with 25% of pilots meeting the threshold for depression within the control group, and this number increased to 41% when using a covert measure to assess depression. DISCUSSION: T his research adds further weight to the potential underreporting of depression in pilots as a function of stigma and fear associated with the label “depression”. Regulators and organizations must proactively minimize exposure to psychological harm, negating the reliance on self-reporting to control psychological risk and recruitment methods must aim to reduce bias against those with disabilities. Nonpunitive environments for pilots to self-assess and report psychological issues will allow better outcomes from expedited treatment. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

Modern standards for research methodologies and materials are used in this study. A standard questionnaire served as a primary tool for assessing the place of basic values. The purpose of the work was to rank the basic value of physical health among economics and psychology students in Georgia. The research methods include data systematization, analysis and synthesis, students questioning, statistical processing of surveys. The study showed that Georgian students of natural and social sciences do not place high priority on physical health as value. On the other hand, moral and material values are prioritized by both groups of respondents. For Ukrainian students, the value of physical health, along with the value of peace, holds leading position likely due to the current developments in the country. The practical value of the obtained results highlights the need for preventive measures to raise the importance of physical health among students in Georgia. These findings should be reflected in the health policies for students of natural and social sciences.

These states are influenced by individuals' cognitive and emotional states. Human factor research aims to objectively quantify these states to prevent human error and maintain constant performances, particularly in high-risk settings such as aviation, where human error and performance account for a significant portion of accidents. Methods: Thus, this study aimed to evaluate and validate two novel methods for assessing the degree of cooperation among professional pilots engaged in real-flight simulation tasks. In addition, the study aimed to assess the ability of the proposed metrics to differentiate between the expertise levels of operating crews based on their levels of cooperation. Eight crews were involved in the experiments, consisting of four crews of Unexperienced pilots and four crews of Experienced pilots. An expert trainer, simulating air traffic management communication on one side and acting as a subject matter expert on the other, provided external evaluations of the pilots' mental states during the simulation. The two novel approaches introduced in this study were formulated based on circular correlation and mutual information techniques. Results and discussion: The findings demonstrated the possibility of quantifying cooperation levels among pilots during realistic flight simulations. In addition, cooperation time is found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) among Experienced pilots compared to Unexperienced ones. Furthermore, these preliminary results exhibited significant correlations (p < 0.05) with subjective and behavioral measures collected every 30 s during the task, confirming their reliability. © © 2024 Capotorto, Ronca, Sciaraffa, Borghini, Di Flumeri, Mezzadri, Vozzi, Giorgi, Germano, Babiloni and Aricò."

This qualitative semi-structured interview study examined the perceived triggering factors and motivations for DPB and the subsequent impact of DPB upon cabin crew well-being and safety. Twenty-four European cabin crew disclosed experiences, subjective observations of perpetrator traits, assessment of DPB development and information regarding their well-being and perceived safety. Thematic analysis revealed that the perceived frequency of DPB had increased, driven by an accumulation of pandemic-related factors–such as enforcing mask wearing amongst intoxicated passengers. DPB was found to decrease resilience and spur maladaptive coping strategies in crew. Suggested enhancements to current DPB mitigation consisted of stricter punishment for DPB as a deterrent, alcohol bans and higher quality training. These findings can inform decision-makers’ efforts to support cabin crew well-being and create safer cabin workplaces in the future. © 2024 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

"Neurocognitive Remediation Therapy: A Promising Approach to Enhance Cognition in Community Living Pilots with Depression and Anxiety","2024","Psychology Research and Behavior Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200970895&partnerID=40&md5=813bf53645d4013c8f62b95d83b2c883","Depression and anxiety are pervasive mental health issues, affecting millions globally and often accompanied by cognitive impairments with significant repercussions in daily life and professions, particularly in safety-critical roles like community-living pilots. This exploration assesses Neurocognitive Remediation Therapy (NRT) as an innovative solution for addressing cognitive deficits linked to depression and anxiety in these pilots. Theoretical underpinnings of NRT draw from cognitive rehabilitation, neuropsychology, and neuroplasticity principles. Depression and anxiety often manifest as cognitive deficits, impacting attention, memory, executive functions, and decision-making. NRT interventions aim to address these impairments by enhancing cognitive flexibility, attentional control, and memory through training exercises and cognitive restructuring, empowering individuals to regain cognitive functionality and adaptability. Empirical evidence supports NRT’s efficacy in enhancing cognitive functioning, showing significant improvements in attention, memory, and executive functions. This review focuses on NRT’s potential to improve cognition in community pilots, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing cognitive deficits and enhancing job performance, even in high-pressure environments like aviation. The practical implications of NRT for pilots are profound. Tailored programs can address specific cognitive challenges, such as maintaining vigilance and decision-making under stress. Integrating NRT into training regimens enhances skill sets and mental resilience, contributing to safety and success. Additionally, NRT positively impacts emotional well-being, reducing stress and improving overall quality of life. In Conclusion, NRT emerges as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive functioning in community-living pilots with depression and anxiety. Evidence suggests its potential to improve performance, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Further research and implementation are crucial to fully realize its benefits and ensure pilots’ safety and success. © 2024 Nuralieva et al."

However, little research exists on how airport employees’ demographic traits shape organisational commitment as a critical indicator of their work performance at international airports. Therefore, this study uniquely investigated these relationships among 380 staff at the Cairo International Airport in Egypt. A survey assessed affective, continuance, and normative commitment considering employees’ gender, age, education, job role, and job tenure. Findings revealed affective ties were most substantial for females, while continuance peaked for younger employees and normative increased with tenure. Significant differences emerged by education level. This addresses gaps by linking social identities to mindsets. Insights implications guide managers: targeted relationship-building and career support can bolster affective commitment in specific subgroups, like younger males. Tailoring initiatives to each demographic’s unique profile maximises loyalty integral to airports’ success in a competitive, skilled labor market. © (2024), (African Journal of Hospitality).

"Touches to the Portrait of the Aviation Designer and Military Pilot Kostyantyn Kalinin","2024","Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196648155&partnerID=40&md5=0997334c35d490fa84905b89a4acfe23","The article is dedicated to the exploration of the lesser-known aspects of the life of the prominent designer and aviator of the 20th century, Kostyantyn Oleksiyovych Kalinin. The purpose of the study is to develop existing notions about Kalinin's personality and life path through historical-psychological analysis. The relevance of the publication is determined by the need to revive historical memory and form a more objective picture (free of ideological overlays) of the life activities of the famous aircraft designer. This will help professionals in the field understand the reasons that prevented the realization of Kalinin's creative potential and the implementation of his most progressive and forward-looking aviation discoveries and developments. The subject of the study is biography of K.O. Kalinin, particularly the events between 1916 and 1919, which later led to political repression, his arrest, and execution. As a result of the analysis of newly introduced documents and data, it was revealed that from December 1918, K.O. Kalinin was the commander of the 1st Volyn (Zhytomyr) Aviation Division, and from February 1919, he commanded the air squad of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) and the Ukrainian Galician Army (UGA), and was also an inspector of the UGA. In the summer and autumn of 1919, he served as the head of the aviation warehouse of the Active Army of the UPR. Later, Kalinin voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the Bolsheviks, concealing some facts of his biography. Describing in 1938 the events that occurred from 1918–1919, Kostyantyn Oleksiyovych tried to avoid repression and save his life. He aimed to realize himself as an aviation designer in his homeland. Partially, he succeeded: from 1923 to 1935, Kalinin designed a series of aircraft, including experimental ones. However, the Bolshevik authority neglected the talent, design skills, and achievements of this extraordinary inventor, aviator, and engineer. On October 22, 1938, after interrogations and torture on fabricated charges, Kostyantyn Oleksiyovych Kalinin was executed. Conclusions: Researching the biographies and achievements of famous domestic aircraft designers allows a better understanding of how the aviation industry developed in our country and what factors influenced this process. A deeper knowledge of the fate, life path, and personal characteristics of K.O. Kalinin will help future aircraft builders form the necessary worldview, value orientations, and personal qualities to overcome contemporary challenges and aspire to develop domestic aircraft construction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Focusing on a German aviation company, this research aims to minimize handling damages caused by workers through a systematic development of gamification strategies. The study involved the application of the How to design gamification process, incorporating a Hexad user types survey and Marczewski’s Periodic Table of Gamification Elements as an ideation base. The preparation phase defined objectives, emphasizing general handling damage reduction and early reporting. Success metrics included the detection of damages, increased reporting, reduced reporting time, and positive worker feedback. The analysis phase utilized the Hexad typology, revealing a concentration on the user types philanthropists, players, and achievers. In the ideation phase, game elements were meticulously selected, and in the design phase, strategies were devised, leading to an emergency button prototype. Implemented at a quality inspection workstation, the emergency button successfully reduced handling damages, with a noticeable increase in reporting and positive worker feedback. Unforeseen benefits included workers reporting defects in raw parts, surpassing the initial quality improvement goal. The study argues for the systematic involvement of affected groups in developing gamification solutions, citing the How to design gamification process as an effective framework. Future plans include a detailed technical implementation, broad prototype deployment, and integration with complementary concepts to foster an improved error culture. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of gamification to address complex, human-centric challenges in industrial settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

The article explores the cognitive resources of the psychoemotional ""response"" to the difficult living conditions of the Covid–19 pandemic period (DLC). DLC is defined as the challenges of a global existential crisis that reflected in the image of the human world, in which a person experiences the limitations of subjective activity and self-realization in the main aspects of being: personal, environmental and socio-psychological. Cognitive resources in the context of DLC are considered as a set of certain aspects of the cognitive sphere, the mobilization of which determines the formation of programs and strategies in the mind of the subject aimed at ensuring personal adaptation in difficult living conditions. Objective: identify the cognitive resources of a psychoemotional ""response"" to difficult living conditions using the method of comparative analysis. Methods. The study involved 112 respondents - civil aviation pilots and medical workers. We used the “Anxiety and Depression” questionnaire (Spielberger), the test for assessing the motivational orientation of the individual (Kuhl), the “Assessing personality reflexivity” questionnaire (Karpov, Ponomareva), and the “Multidimensional-functional diagnostics of responsibility” technique (Pryadein). Results. According to the criterion of stability of mental states, two groups of subjects were identified: equilibrium (85 people; n1) and nonequilibrium (27 people; n2). An invariant component of cognitive resources has been established: reflection of activity. Specific resources have identified. In group n1 there were five factors (77.34%): reflection of activity (33.26%); cognitive responsibility (13.34%); metacognitive control of failure activities (12.68%); responsible metacognitive control of planning activities (9.72%); metacognitive control of failure of retrospective and prospective activities (8.33%). The lack of cognitive resource provision in group n2 is due to three factors (70.30%): control of failure and self-centered responsibility (32.33%); cognitive awareness (23.15%); metacognitive control of activity planning and its success was based on reflection of retrospective activity and communication (14.82%). Specific cognitive resources for civil aviation pilots and medical workers are also highlighted. Discussion. The study made it possible to determine the factors of cognitive resource support for stable and nonequilibrium psycho-emotional states, which contributes to the verification of the concepts of semantic regulation of mental states, metacognitive, resource, subject-resource approaches in modern times. © 2024 Russian Psychological Society.

"The mechanisms linking perceived stress to pilots’ safety attitudes: a chain mediation effect of job burnout and cognitive flexibility","2024","Frontiers in Public Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196088669&partnerID=40&md5=565f742b4ea1709885d21b8649da2faf","Introduction: Pilots’ safety attitude is crucial for aviation safety. Current research shows a correlation between perceived stress and safety attitude, yet the mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. Against the backdrop of heightened attention to pilots’ stress, this study aims to thoroughly explore the inherent connection between pilot safety attitudes and their perceived stress, offering targeted insights into preventing and addressing safety attitude issues arising from pilot stress. Methods: Through path analysis of questionnaire data from 106 civil aviation pilots in China, this study systematically investigates the roles of job burnout and cognitive flexibility in the relationship between perceived stress and safety attitude. The study reveals the chain-mediated mechanism of these two factors. Results: The results demonstrate a significantly negative correlation between pilots’ perceived stress and safety attitude, with cognitive flexibility and job burnout fully mediating this relationship, and cognitive flexibility affecting job burnout. A detailed analysis of the three dimensions of job burnout reveals varying impacts of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment on the aforementioned path. The research model exhibits a good fit (GFI=0.902), providing new theoretical perspectives on the association between pilots’ perceived stress and safety attitude.

Novices face higher heart rate, cognitive workload and heightened physiological arousal, while experienced participants exhibit controlled responses. The study underscores the non-linear relationship between experience and physiological responses, influenced by individual differences and coping mechanisms. Over time, repeated exposure leads to a learning curve, showcasing the adaptive nature of human responses in aviation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
"A Measurement Tool of Airline Transport Pilot’s Psychological Competency and Its Application","2024","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195867480&partnerID=40&md5=f46a664e93fa12a3f469697ea4da3ea4","Certain inherent psychological risks in pilots pose challenges that are difficult to tackle using low-cost flight training. Evaluating the psychological competence of pilots or aspiring flight students is crucial, and this study introduces a pilot’s psychological competency measurement tool and its application. The measurement framework and method for evaluating airline transport pilot’s psychological competency were developed based on the professional characteristics of airline transport pilots and the requirements of implementing pilots’ Professionalism Lifecycle Management (PLM) system proposed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The evaluation tool, grounded in occupational adaptability psychology and mental health considerations, focused on six dimensions: general cognitive ability, operational and professional ability, social-interpersonal ability, personality traits and attitude, mental quality, and mental state. To measure general cognitive ability and operational and professional ability, a combination of flight control sticks, a computer, and a tablet was employed. Social-interpersonal ability, personality traits and attitude, mental quality, and mental state were assessed using a tablet. Collaborating with various airlines and flight academies, the data collection phase was executed in March, July, and October of 2023. Robust and valid psychological competency data were collected from a diverse pool, including 22 airline pilots (average age 27.23 ± 3.32 years), 169 ab initio pilots (average age 24.57 ± 1.52 years), and 130 flight students (average age 22.38 ± 0.791 years). The findings from this comprehensive analysis illuminated some distinctions among ab initio pilots, airline pilots, and flight students. Notably, flight students showcased exceptional performance in the dimension of general cognitive abilities, demonstrating their cognitive prowess. On the other hand, airline pilots exhibited superior skills in flight operational capabilities, highlighting their expertise in psychomotor skills. However, a noteworthy concern emerged regarding flight students, revealing a higher prevalence of personality disorders and dangerous attitudes. Additionally, flight students exhibited a more intense negative mental health state, raising critical considerations about their overall psychological well-being. In contrast, airline pilots and ab initio pilots displayed more positive psychological health overall. In conclusion, this research initiative goes beyond the mere introduction of a valuable psychological competency measurement tool; it delves into a comprehensive analysis of its practical application. The collaborative endeavors with airlines and flight academies, paired with the meticulous collection and analysis of data, not only vividly showcase the user-friendliness and practical applicability of the tool but also significantly contribute to the ongoing discourse on the optimization of pilot training programs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

This was a result of several accidents where aircraft with no, or minor technical faults, crashed from a failure to utilize effectively the human resources available on the flight deck. CRM draws upon the disciplines of management science, organizational and social psychology. It originated in civil aviation, but its practices have now been adopted in other high-risk, high-performance industries where staff work in coordinated teams, e.g. Air Traffic Control, surgery, nuclear power operations and shipping. CRM is now facing new challenges to promote effective, coordinated teamwork. Teams are often now distributed across many locations but are still required to coordinate their activities in real time. CRM now must evolve to support the actions of remote and distributed teams. At the 2023 HCI International Conference in Copenhagen, a working group formed from subject matter experts to identify application areas and describe the key challenges faced in promoting CRM for remoted and distributed teams both during normal and non-normal operations. This paper describes the workings and initial findings of this working group. The results show that process areas, such as such as promoting Team Situation Awareness, workload management, coordination, and monitoring of the cognitive and affective states of others are more important for developing remote and distributed team CRM than are addressing the limitations imposed by the underpinning technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

The ability to perform the required flying tasks under stressful conditions is critical. However, unexpected or threatening events have the potential to trigger a startle reflex, a phenomenon that can lead to cognitive incapacitation and potentially catastrophic accidents. Few studies have examined brain activity following a startle reflex, especially during a complex cognitive task. We conducted an experiment in which we induced a startle reflex using loud acoustic stimuli while participants were engaged in the Toulouse n-back task (engaging memory processes and mental calculation). During the task, brain measures were obtained using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and facial temperature was recorded using a thermal camera. Our initial findings reveal that the startle reflex has been successfully induced, as demonstrated by the observable behavioral reactions captured in the camera recordings. After experiencing the startle reflex, participants showed a brief decrease in task performance, suggesting a momentary disruption of cognitive processes, highlighting the potential implications of the startle reflex for aviation safety. The integration of multimodal physiological techniques will allow us to comprehensively investigate both cerebral and peripheral physiological responses during the startle reflex. Our research will contribute to the understanding of how startle responses can affect cognitive performance and shed light on the potential cognitive incapacitation that may result from this phenomenon. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
"Practice effects of a breathing technique on pilots’ cognitive and stress associated heart rate variability during flight operations","2024","Stress","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195629319&partnerID=40&md5=8e936e0a37390fd7dd86bc39a0606ec0","Commercial pilots endure multiple stressors in their daily and occupational lives which are detrimental to psychological well-being and cognitive functioning. The Quick coherence technique (QCT) is an effective intervention tool to improve stress resilience and psychophysiological balance based on a five-minute paced breathing exercise with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback. The current research reports on the application of QCT training within an international airline to improve commercial pilots’ psychological health and support cognitive functions. Forty-four commercial pilots volunteered in a one-month training programme to practise self-regulated QCT in day-to-day life and flight operations. Pilots’ stress index, HRV time-domain and frequency-domain parameters were collected to examine the influence of QCT practice on the stress resilience process. The results demonstrated that the QCT improved psychophysiological indicators associated with stress resilience and cognitive functions, in both day-to-day life and flight operation settings. HRV fluctuations, as measured through changes in RMSSD and LF/HF, revealed that the resilience processes were primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activities that are important in promoting pilots’ energy mobilization and cognitive functions, thus QCT has huge potential in facilitating flight performance and aviation safety. These findings provide scientific evidence for implementing QCT as an effective mental support programme and controlled rest strategy to improve pilots’ psychological health, stress management, and operational performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Air India pee gate case – need for comprehensive SOPs in customer management","2024","Emerald Emerging Markets Case Studies","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194240638&partnerID=40&md5=8842b440e882e140917085c6e067bd4c","Learning outcomes: This case study allows students to appreciate the value of standard operating procedures in customer management. This case study emphasises the role of employees in delivering superior customer experience. This case study explores many facets of customer experience, reputation, social class membership and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Students will be able to apply theories of customer experience, behavioural psychology and service dimensions relevant to the airline industry. After completing this case study, students will be able to do the following:1. Evaluate the value of SOPs in Customer ManagementThis case study refers to the need for adhering to SOPs to deal with complex situations. Students will be able to evaluate whether compliance to SOPs could have helped Air India avoid the crisis or was it possible that a culture of absolute commitment to customer wellbeing could have prevented the crisis.2. Apply the theory of defensive attribution in customer grievance handling. Discuss if reducing customer effort in getting their problem solved can result in superior customer service.The victim had attributed the blame for not insisting on filing a complaint to the crew. Air India crew had defended their actions or lack of it by stating that they had followed the rule book. Students will be able to appreciate the need for a swift redressal mechanism to protect the self-image and self-esteem of the person/group involved. They will also understand that customer service interactions designed to solve customer problems swiftly and easily can be a very simple dictum to guide all employees in their decision-making while handling a customer complaint. 3. Evaluate the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer experience and examine the value of net promoter score (NPS) to study customer satisfaction. Air India Airlines was catering to varied customer groups such as the Indian diaspora, large student population pursuing education abroad, first-time flyers and the rising middle class with travel aspirations. Customer expectations vary across segments and change over their lifetime. Airline staff must trace customer corridors and deliver on customer expectation across the touch points that matter to them to ensure meaningful and relevant service delivery. Students will have an opportunity to evaluate the NPS in measuring customer satisfaction and debate whether it is a sufficient metric to guide the organisation on delivering and monitoring customer experience. 4. Examine why reputation risk management and not crisis management should be the focus of Air India in delivering superior customer service because nearly 70%–80% of market value for a company comes from its intangible assets such as brand equity and reputation. Students will discuss crisis management i.e. handling the threat to reputation after it has occurred and reputation risk management i.e. proactively managing potential threats to its reputation by taking timely actions to avoid or mitigate it. There are three factors (reputation reality gap, changing beliefs and expectation and weak internal coordination) that determine reputational risks. Students can evaluate this model to determine if Air India should address these three factors to manage its reputation proactively. Case overview/synopsis: This case study is set around an incident that happened on 26 November 2022, on Air India flight bound for Delhi from New York when an inebriated 34-year-old man had peed on a 72-year-old woman. The perpetrator of the crime had walked free, and the victim was left dissatisfied with how the cabin crew had handled her ordeal. Air India Airlines was launched in 1932 by industrialist JRD Tata and nationalised in 1953. In 2021, Tata Group acquired the 90-year-old Air India from the Government of India for $2.4bn (INR 18,000 crore) and appointed Campbell Wilson as chief executive officer and managing director. The incident brought to the fore the customer management issues that Wilson had to address. First on the list of Air India’s turnaround plan was delivering “exceptional customer experience”. How was it going to achieve it because the Indian aviation ecosystem lacked infrastructure such as airports, airspace, competition and customer preference-based services? There was also shortage of pilots, engineers, technicians, air-traffic controllers and technocrats to occupy positions within security agencies and regulatory bodies. With Air India’s acquisition, the Tata Group had to find innovative solutions to deal with decades of internal neglect, non-performance and labour union problems. This case study is relevant to address real issues of customer experience, consumer psychology, reputation risk management and standard operating procedures in service management. Complexity academic level: This case is suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate level students of business management. It can also be used for training service personnel of aviation industry. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

In particular, these include maintaining awareness of obstacles associated with flight at very low altitudes. Wire strikes are a common cause of accidents in these operations. METHODS: Focus groups were completed during the 2022 Ag Aviation Expo hosted by the National Agricultural Aviation Association with pilots who had experienced wire-strike events (N = 22). The researchers coded the transcripts using a human factors framework. RESULTS: Notably, unplanned “trim passes” were a key stage of flight during wire-strike events. Cognitive risk factors that may have affected their performance included situation awareness, decision-making choices, and pressure to perform. Over half of subjects reported being aware of the wire before collision. Possible prevention strategies include not spraying the field due to safety risks, paying better attention to where they were in the field, and avoiding deviation from the planned route. DISCUSSION: Wire-strike events often occur due to momentary lapses in attention, even when the pilot is already aware of the wire. This study shows that targeted approaches to prevent wire strikes in agricultural aviation operations require addressing a number of cognitive risks and human factors, rather than implementing increased preflight surveillance. These results have implications for preventing future wire-strike accidents based directly on pilot perceptions, both within agricultural operations and general aviation more broadly. © (2024) the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

The reasons for this are unclear. The purpose of this research was to develop a theory as to why this program is successful. METHODS: A qualitative examination following grounded theory methodology was undertaken. AOD program patients and healthcare professionals were interviewed until content saturation was reached. Data analysis followed grounded theory to identify the key concepts associated with the program’s success. RESULTS: T he core theory that emerged highlighted the pivotal roles of a strong employee–company relationship, shared values, and a safety-focused culture in explicating the program’s success. This moves beyond the “carrot and stick” model of motivation, where belonging to this organization and safety consciousness serve as powerful drivers for abstinence. Challenges and barriers highlighted some unique challenges to the program in managing the coronavirus pandemic and the difference in approach to substance use in community spaces versus safety-critical employment.

Although pilots’ physical and mental health problems have become increasingly prominent, their health has not been taken seriously. This study aimed to clarify challenges and support needs related to psychological and physical health among pilots to inform development of a more scientific and comprehensive physical and mental health system for civil aviation pilots. Methods: This qualitative study recruited pilots from nine civil aviation companies. Focus group interviews via an online conference platform were conducted in August 2022. Colaizzi analysis was used to derive themes from the data and explore pilots’ experiences, challenges, and support needs. Results: The main sub-themes capturing pilots’ psychological and physical health challenges were: (1) imbalance between family life and work; (2) pressure from assessment and physical examination eligibility requirements; (3) pressure from worries about being infected with COVID-19; (4) nutrition deficiency during working hours; (5) changes in eating habits because of the COVID-19 pandemic; (6) sleep deprivation; (7) occupational diseases; (8) lack of support from the company in coping with stress; (9) pilots’ yearly examination standards; (10) support with sports equipment; (11) respecting planned rest time; and (12) isolation periods. Discussion: The interviewed pilots experienced major psychological pressure from various sources, and their physical health condition was concerning. We offer several suggestions that could be addressed to improve pilots’ physical and mental health.

Consequently, the European flight crew members have experienced diverse adverse outcomes. Historically, unions play a protective role in restructuring periods and challenging times, that is, union instrumentality. However, can unions still play a significant role in their members’ satisfaction when confronting an unknown pandemic? The present study explores the relationship between union satisfaction and four well-being indicators—mental health, organizational dehumanization, medication use, and job insecurity among European flight crew during the Covid-19 lockdown. A total of 1293 crew members (271 cockpit crew and 1022 cabin crew) across 53 major European airlines involving 42 nationalities completed an online survey. We control the following variables, e.g., age, gender, marital status, children (yes or no), professional group (cockpit crew or cabin crew), types of airline, relationship with the principal airline, and employment status—hours worked during lockdown. We test our hypotheses using hierarchical regression analyses and demonstrate the following novel discoveries. First, during the lockdown, employees with higher union satisfaction experience a lower level of airline management’s organizational dehumanization. We mainly observe a buffering effect of union representation at the airline-specific level. Second, other exciting buffering effects illustrate that a higher level of satisfaction with the union representation is significantly and positively associated with mental health and negatively associated with medication usage and job insecurity, even after controlling for confounding variables. Third, our results suggest that union representation can indirectly affect safety performance for the vulnerable target group at this critical time. Finally, we offer practical implications regarding policy and workplace management. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty pilots were separated into two groups based on their flight experience and completed the high- and low-visibility approaches in balanced order using a high-fidelity flight simulator. Pilots’ mental workload and visual scanning patterns were recorded via an eye tracker. The results showed that, compared to less flight-experienced pilots (20%, 3/15), experienced pilots (80%, 4/5) were more likely to make go-around decisions in the low-visibility approaches. Furthermore, they exhibited a more flexible and adaptable visual scanning pattern by quickly shifting their attention, as evidenced by decreased fixations and increased saccades.

This trend is not present in the third stage, which indicates that pilots and the safety management system of the airline demonstrated resilience to cope with the flight disruptions during the pandemic. Through the analysis of event severity, FDM enables safety managers to recommend measures to increase safety resilience and self-monitoring capabilities of both operators and regulators. Practitioner summary: The onset of the pandemic led to a rise in the severity of flight data monitoring events in a large airline, likely linked to a lack of operational practice and skills decay. This was demonstrated across different flight phases and aircraft types. In the settled pandemic period, the severity index returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the resilience of individual pilots and safety management systems is critical to operational safety.HIGHLIGHTS The FDM event severity scores significantly increased following the pandemic onset, especially for event categories involving pilot core competencies. The FDM event severity scores stagnated or decreased during the later pandemic stage indicating resilience among the airline pilots and the airline’s safety management system. The airline and pilots demonstrated resilience by effectively mitigating the effects of proficiency decay which took place as the pandemic started. FDM analysis has shown to be effective in establishing a proactive SMS programme to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on aviation safety. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Are Peer Support Programs Effective in the Detection and Prevention of Mental Health Issues in Commercial Aviation?","2024","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176744596&partnerID=40&md5=f0e245efc8e0b6bc3622b3cbc858b208","Background: In the aftermath of the Germanwings crash in 2015, several regulations have been instituted around pilots’ mental health issues and flight safety. One of these (CAT.GEN.MPA.215) stipulates that European operators are to implement a Peer Support Program to encourage pilots’ self-referral of mental health issues and identify mental wellbeing issues as early as possible. However, knowledge is scarce regarding how effective these programs are on a range of outcomes. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify articles investigating peer support programs and their effectiveness in preventing and detecting mental health issues, in commercial aviation and other high-risk organizations. Method: A systematic search was performed in three databases, following the structure of the PRISMA guidelines. All articles (2.123) were exported to Rayyan Citation, where the screening process was performed. Results: Four articles met the final inclusion criteria. Overall, the search revealed little empirical evidence of the effectiveness of peer support in detecting and preventing mental health. Conclusion: Although there is limited or no evidence in any direction, the peer support programs seem to be without evident harm and were generally appreciated. The insufficient empirical evidence is nonetheless concerning, with these programs being implemented throughout Europe in such a high-risk context as the aviation industry. The results highlight the importance of more research on peer support in aviation. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

EI has been used to gain insights into decision making in corporate Human Resource Management (HRM) contexts, as well as in stressful situations. The link between EI and decision making in HRM could have great benefits to training and management in high-consequence and safety-critical industries. This research investigated the association between EI and decision making of pilots in the aviation industry. The aim was to uncover the level of association between EI dimensions and decision making for pilots; as well as to understand the role that pilots perceive EI dimensions play in their decision making in safety-critical scenarios. One hundred and seventeen pilots completed an online survey comprised of the Wong-Law EI Scale, decision making scenarios, and open-ended questions. The mixed-method analysis of the survey data showed a correlation between individual EI dimensions and decision-making scenarios, rather than the total scores. There are potential implications for general HRM research in EI and decision making as well as practical implications for the aviation industry. Overall, it was found that there is a link between EI and decision making, specifically for scenarios that involve other cognitive functions. © 2023"

This study aimed to explore the effects of sleep problems on depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese commercial pilots. Methods: Adults who participated in the baseline assessment of the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China between December 2022 and March 2023 formed the study sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed using standardized scales. Sleep duration was measured with standardized questions. Logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to analyze the association between sleep problems and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 7055 pilots were included in this study. The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety among pilots was 23.3% (n = 1642; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.3%–24.3%) and 17.0% (n = 1196; 95% CI = 16.1–17.8%), respectively. Logistic regression analyses revealed that short sleep duration (<7 h) was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.491; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 2.555; p < 0.001), while poor sleep quality was also associated with a higher risk of depression (OR = 7.297; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 7.469; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, there was an inverse, J-shaped nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and both depression (inflection point: 7.64 h) and anxiety (inflection point: 7.48 h). Similarly, a J-shaped nonlinear relationship was found between sleep quality and depression/anxiety with an inflection point of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) = 4 points for both. The major limitation of the study was that causal relationships between variables could not be inferred due to the cross-sectional study design. Conclusion: This study found that depression and anxiety were common among Chinese commercial pilots. Insufficient length and poor quality of sleep were associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Implementing targeted strategies to improve sleep patterns is crucial for reducing the risk of depression and anxiety in this population. © © 2024 Pan Chen et al."

Reports show that gender is one of the risk factors of insomnia, and most Asian flight attendants are female. Therefore, it is necessary to understand insomnia, and the correction to mental health among female flight attendants. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of insomnia in female flight attendants and its association with mental health. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional design. We recruited 412 female flight attendants with more than 3 months of working experience. We collected the socio-demographic and work-related data, measured insomnia and mental health by the Athens Insomnia and Brief Symptom Rating Scales. Descriptive statistics, single-factor analysis of variance, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling were performed to analyze the relationships. RESULTS: There are 45.4% of female flight attendants having insomnia, and 24.8% had suspicious insomnia. The most considerable and serious insomnia problem was falling asleep (15.3%, 4.9%). Factors related to insomnia include smoking, drinking, family load (e.g., housekeeping and caring for family), economic stress and late-night/early morning workdays during last month. Also, insomnia had a direct association with mental health (T = 17.11, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found that insomnia is negatively correlated with the above factors and mental health. We recommend that airline industries can run their sleep-education programs and provide relevant mental-health-promotion programs for flight attendants. © 2023 – IOS Press. All rights reserved."

This study examined the relationships between risk perceptions of the pandemic, vocational identity, and employment aspirations of Chinese aviation students. Methods: The study used a convenience sampling approach to collect data (n = 276 respondents) from August 2 to 8, 2022. An online survey was sent via WeChat and QQ to Chinese students majoring in aviation service management who were under lockdown at six Chinese schools. Results: In spite of the strong support for the stringent COVID policies and full awareness of infection risk and protective measures, respondents were worried about the current unstable situation and felt fear for its severity and long-lasting symptoms. The casual path from career commitment to employment aspiration was supported, but high risk perceptions of the pandemic failed to have any psychological effect on the two constructs of vocational identity and employment aspirations. Conclusions: The findings not only demonstrate the power of career commitment on employment aspirations but also reveal that a relatively high self-assessment of career proficiency may not necessarily lead to a clear career aspiration, possibly due to poor risk communication and insufficient career planning guidance. Thus, Chinese aviation students should improve their career proficiency and commitment, broaden their career options and adaptability, and have a clear career plan, in order to be well prepared for the fierce job market that will face the next wave of the ongoing pandemic. © 2023, The Author(s)."

We reviewed 72 relevant articles to summarise the insights regarding three research questions: 1) what roles in aviation were studied concerning aviation safety? 2) how are the eye-tracking features utilised to address the dirty dozen issues? 3) what challenges remain in exploiting eye tracking to promote aviation safety? According to the reviewed articles, eye movements have been used to monitor the operators' mental states in real-time and provide references for operators’ awareness enhancement measures in aviation. However, more comprehensive exploitation of eye-tracking technologies covering more non-pilot roles in aviation is still unexploited. Besides, real-time applications based on eye-tracking technologies are still rare due to the considerable preprocessing time of raw data. Therefore, this work advocates for the exploitation of eye-tracking technologies to investigate the behaviours of various roles in aviation. It also calls for the enhancement of the data processing model to develop more real-time applications based on eye-tracking in future studies. Practical applications: It is hoped this work could provide a basis for human-performance-related aviation safety research and attract more open discussions in the explorations and implementation of utilising eye-tracking technologies to promote aviation safety. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Aircraft-assisted suicide: The rarity of attempts, ideation, or underreporting?","2023","Forensic Science International: Mind and Law","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152105861&partnerID=40&md5=f6dd54b3b30d1b0fb94c57aa9eb80d19","Introduction: Aircraft-assisted suicide is a rare but serious event, with immediate consequences for the pilot, crew, and passengers. The overt linkage between mental illness and suicidal behaviour is well-known, however, the infrequency of these events in the context of aviation, coupled with poor record-keeping and reluctance to disclose, likely disguises the true extent of mental illness among pilots. One critical research gap in Canada has been the lack of investigation of crashes linked to suicide or a mental disorder. Research on aircraft-assisted suicide will address the key issues of pilots’ reluctance to disclose, report, and seek mental health services. Our study investigates the frequency of aircraft-assisted suicide in Canada, reviews current medical standards, and discusses preventative interventions to manage future risk. Materials and methods: Our study examined investigations and reports conducted by the Transport Safety Board to explore the frequency of aircraft-assisted suicide over a ten year period. Results: Aircraft-assisted suicides in Canada are rare, however, mentally ill pilots involved in fatal crashes are likely underestimated. Our study highlights key barriers in aviators’ disclosure of mental health symptoms, an ineffective screening process, and a consequence-based system that deters pilots from their duty to report. Discussion: our investigative analysis addresses key limitations in screening of mentally ill pilots, explores current medical standards and aeromedical exams, infrequency of fitness assessments, and demonstrates the critical need for continuous evaluation of pilots in this safety-sensitive occupation. Conclusion: The current paper addresses the need for continuous evaluation of pilot's mental health and a more rigorous screening process to accurately identify suicide risk in pilots and prevent aircraft-assisted suicide. © 2023"
"Using machine learning methods and EEG to discriminate aircraft pilot cognitive workload during flight","2023","Scientific Reports","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147899374&partnerID=40&md5=96525a2c76a76fa171128c097a35a43e","Pilots of aircraft face varying degrees of cognitive workload even during normal flight operations. Periods of low cognitive workload may be followed by periods of high cognitive workload and vice versa. During such changing demands, there exists potential for increased error on behalf of the pilots due to periods of boredom or excessive cognitive task demand. To further understand cognitive workload in aviation, the present study involved collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data from ten (10) collegiate aviation students in a live-flight environment in a single-engine aircraft. Each pilot possessed a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate and either FAA class I or class II medical certificate. Each pilot flew a standardized flight profile representing an average instrument flight training sequence. For data analysis, we used four main sub-bands of the recorded EEG signals: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Power spectral density (PSD) and log energy entropy of each sub-band across 20 electrodes were computed and subjected to two feature selection algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE) and lasso cross-validation (LassoCV), and a stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm composed of support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Also, hyperparameter optimization and tenfold cross-validation were used to improve the model performance, reliability, and generalization. The feature selection step resulted in 15 features that can be considered an indicator of pilots' cognitive workload states. Then these features were applied to the stacking ensemble algorithm, and the highest results were achieved using the selected features by the RFE algorithm with an accuracy of 91.67% (± 0.11), a precision of 93.89% (± 0.09), recall of 91.67% (± 0.11), F-score of 91.22% (± 0.12), and the mean ROC-AUC of 0.93 (± 0.06). The achieved results indicated that the combination of PSD and log energy entropy, along with well-designed machine learning algorithms, suggest the potential for the use of EEG to discriminate periods of the low, medium, and high workload to augment aircraft system design, including flight automation features to improve aviation safety. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The Application and Prospect of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in Aviation Psychology; 近红外光谱技术在航空心理学研究中的应用与展望","2023","Journal of Psychological Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018757443&partnerID=40&md5=d5584d604c68715dc9fd86637a26b311","As the operational subject of aviation activities, the cognitive activity of pilots has a significant impact on flight safety. In decades, researchers are unable to obtain information about the neural activity of pilots during simulated or real flights efficiently because of the limitation of technology, which greatly hinders the understanding of the mental processing processes and the way pilots work. The development and application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a solution to this problem. It allows continuous, non-invasive, portable monitoring of hemodynamic changes associated with human brain function. Compared to the physical limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the low spatial resolution of the electroencephalogram (EEG), the portability and hypersensitivity to the body movement of fNIRS makes it more suitable for detecting cortical hemodynamics during exercise tasks. The brain functional activation and functional connectivity states of pilots in different cognitive task demand states can be revealed through fNIRS to provide a realistic basis for neuroergonomics studies of flight safety, and provide valid physiological neurological indicators for identifying different cognitive states. To this end, this paper reviewed studies in aviation psychology applying fNIRS, and summarized some general findings that can provide reference and guidance for maintaining aviation safety. The aeropsychological studies applying fNIRS can be divided into three themes: (1) The usability studies of fNIRS in the assessment of brain activation patterns, which focus on mental load assessment and skill training assessment. The assessment of mental load refers to the detection of brain activation patterns under different task difficulties (i.e., the examination of the similarities and differences of brain activation patterns under different mental loads), aiming to confirm the reliability of fNIRS in assessing mental load. The assessment of skill training refers to the use of fNIRS to measure the changes of brain activation patterns of individuals during the same training task and the differences of brain activation patterns of different individuals on the same training task. (2) The accuracy studies of fNIRS in brain activation pattern recognition. That is, using the neural signals evoked by the task as brain activation indicators, combined with specific statistical methods (e.g., machine learning algorithms) to perform discriminative analysis at the individual level to correctly classify different mental loads. (3) The applicability study of fNIRS in special events, emphasizing the use of fNIRS to detect brain tissue blood oxygenation in pilots experiencing special events (e.g., loss of consciousness under high +Gz) to reveal the neurophysiological mechanisms. With the widespread use of fNIRS, more relevant research can be conducted around pilots. It can be used in pilot selection and training, flight cockpit design, and crew cooperation. In addition, fNIRS also can be used to assess pilots' cognitive load states and mental fatigue as a staffing tool. When focusing on the impact of workload on individual performance, a pilot's emotional perceptions or preferences should be seriously considered. Typically, we monitor individual pilots' workload to measure the blood oxygern concentration changes in the prefrontal cortex, which is an important region that facilitates emotion regulation, in individual pilots. Functional neuroimaging of the prefrontal cortex has been applied to study the neural correlates of emotional processing. In terms of fNIRS device configuration, the addition of an emotional computing interface to the workload interface needs to be considered, so that the cognitive state of pilots can be monitored and identified in terms of both workload and emotional experience. In addition, passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) technology and multimodal technology can be applied in the future in real environments to assess the mental state of pilots and team resources in real flight and to dynamically plan programming pilots and automated interactions. Finally, in the future, fNIRS research should also focus on methodological advances (e.g., signal quality control, motion artifact correction strategies, etc.), and standardization of the analysis process. On the one hand, it can provide guidance for future fNIRS studies on pilots; on the other hand, it can help promote the application of fNIRS in aviation psychology research, which ultimately serves aviation safety directly or indirectly. © 2023 Chinese Psycholocial Society.

Due to recent upgrades in technology, the quality of the experience has improved for users, especially the spatial and temporal consistencies of the scene displayed, and scientists' efforts are focused on designing innovative and seamless interaction modalities, especially in the aviation sector. Nevertheless, the level of requirements being remarkably high in such industry, the implementation of this technology raises the question of the impact of its use under constrained environments and how scientific validation of devices can be performed. Therefore, it is needed to implement a methodology to assess the effects of augmented reality on an operator in a constrained environment. Firstly, the challenges that arise when assessing augmented reality impacts under constrained environments are discussed by emphasizing on the specific use case of head-mounted displays.

"Studies on the Relationship between Occupational Stress and Mental Health, Performance, and Job Satisfaction of Chinese Civil Aviation Pilots","2023","Aerospace","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175249286&partnerID=40&md5=0bd7b3c613e3e7886729034d24553abf","This research work delves into the potential impact of occupational stress on the mental health, performance, and job satisfaction of civil aviation pilots. To explore this triadic relationship, a battery of six distinct scales was employed, including the Chinese Civil Aviation Pilot Occupational Stress Scale, the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), the Flight Performance Scale, the Job Satisfaction Scale, the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 131 valid questionnaires were collected for analysis, yielding a valid response rate of 65.5%. The findings demonstrate a negative correlation between occupational stress experienced by Chinese civil aviation pilots and their mental health, performance, and job satisfaction. Notably, a positive coping style was identified as a moderator in the relationship between occupational stress and flight performance, effectively mitigating the negative impact of stress on flight performance. Similarly, a negative coping style was found to moderate the relationship between occupational stress and job satisfaction, attenuating the adverse effects of occupational stress on job satisfaction. This study underscores the predictive utility of investigating the occupational stress experienced by pilots for understanding their mental health, performance, and job satisfaction. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for adjusting the negative impact of occupational stress on flight performance and job satisfaction through interventions that target pilots’ coping styles. © 2023 by the authors."
"Advanced warning method for aircraft landing risk under air –ground data real-time transmission conditions; 空地数据实时传输下的飞机着陆风险预警方法","2023","Gongcheng Kexue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Engineering","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172732515&partnerID=40&md5=862111ced90ace20da05a076be7281f3","At present, the flight safety work of civil aviation in China mainly investigates the probable causes of accidents and analyzes flight data after air accidents, causing numerous problems such as passive safety management and delayed risk control. To realize the early warning of flight risk during flight, a dynamic method for the evaluation of landing risk and early warning under the condition of future air –ground data real-time transmission was proposed. The landing stage, which has the most complex operation program and the highest accident rate during a flight, was taken as the research object, and future air-to-ground high-throughput interconnection scenarios comprising 5G and satellite networks were considered to solve the problem of advanced intelligent warnings and aircraft alarms in abnormal flights. First, according to the accident causation theory, the human factor reliability model, the system model, and other theories or models, a landing warning index system based on multisource real-time operation data and the integration of historical statistics and expert knowledge was established. Then, a grounding parameter prediction model was established to solve the problem of lag in the acquisition of four grounding parameters, namely ground pitch angle, ground speed, ground vertical rate, and 50 ft-ground horizontal flight distance in actual flight. This model classified the pilot’s landing operation mode by clustering ARJ21 historical landing data and determined the attribute mean value of the four parameters for each type of operation mode. Furthermore, according to decision field theory, the model discussed the landing mode selection of pilots with different personalities in different scenarios and calculated the selection probability of the pilot’s landing operation mode, thereby obtaining the predicted values of the four above-mentioned indicators. According to the above, aiming at the complexity and uncertainty of the landing risk early warning system, a reasoning method of the multilayer confidence rule base was proposed. This method improved the traditional reasoning method of the single-layer confidence rule base and adopted the bottom-up hierarchical reasoning method considering the complexity characteristics of the landing process, effectively integrating different sources and forms of qualitative or quantitative data. Thus, the dynamic assessment and reasoning of the landing risk were realized. Finally, using the reasoning-based calculation of the landing process for the “2020.10.16 Panzhihua runway grounding event” and “2010.8.2 Yichun air disaster,” the results verified the effectiveness of the method. It was found that the early warning time of the Panzhihua event can reach 13 s. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved."

"The Psychological Mechanisms of Pilots’ Plan Continuation Errors; 飞行员计划延续失误的心理机制","2023","Journal of Psychological Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018785348&partnerID=40&md5=795297cee23ce02df5803f7b52d78450","Plan Continuation Errors (PCEs) is defined as the “failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that it is no longer safe”. In this paper, we reviewed the scientific literature on PCEs. PCEs usually occur in weather-related decision-making situations, manifested by pilots unintentionally or intentionally using Visual Flight Rules (VFR) to manipulate the aircraft into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). In this case, the pilot loses the mental model and cognitive skills necessary to maintain control of the aircraft due to the lack of visual reference information to the horizon, causing catastrophic consequences. Therefore, how to identify and analyze the psychological characteristics and mechanisms of pilot PCEs is not only a frontier subject in aviation psychology research, but also a major practical problem that needs to be resolved in the current aviation safety management practice. The underlying mechanisms of the PCEs were summarized as follows: (1)Situation assessment. This mechanism believes that PCEs is caused by pilots who are completely unaware of severe weather conditions or fail to accurately diagnose weather changes and their severity. (2) Decision-making framework. This mechanism explains PCEs on the basis of the prospect theory and the sunk cost effect, which suggests that PCEs are caused by pilots' strong expectation of reaching their destination, which changed their decision-making framework, which in turn led to their underestimation of the severity of the weather. (3) Cognitive heuristics. This mechanism believes that pilots adopt cognitive shortcuts or cognitive heuristics to solve problems for easy cognitive workload, which can easily lead to cognitive bias in pilots' weather-related decision-making process, resulting in decision error and PCEs. In addition, researchers have conducted many empirical studies to understand factors that may affect pilot PCEs. To sum up, the results mainly focus on six aspects, including flight experience, personality characteristics, emotional state, weather radar display system, flight environment, organization, and social pressure. On the basis of the review of existing research, three future directions for this line of research were also discussed. First, previous studies have mainly explored the psychological mechanisms of pilot PCEs from three aspects: situation assessment, decision-making framework and cognitive heuristics. However, these mechanisms have not revealed the whole picture of pilot PCEs, and most of them remain in the theoretical level. Future research can try to further explore the mechanisms of PCEs from a new perspective, such as perseveration behaviors. Second, previous PCEs research mainly focused on the information processing mechanism at the perceptual level, which belongs to the low-level cognitive processing process and is unable to reveal the psychological mechanism of PCEs more deeply. Therefore, future research should explore the higher cognitive neural mechanism of PCEs and try to reveal the cause and brain mechanism of PCEs more comprehensively. Third, current PCEs intervention studies are mostly from the perspective of human-computer interaction and cockpit human factor design, and there is a lack of intervention studies on the pilots themselves. Future research can be based on the psychological mechanisms of PCEs, and further expand the prevention research of PCEs for the pilots, such as carrying out weather cue recognition training based on the situation assessment mechanism of PCEs. Furthermore, future studies are expected to explore how to prevent PCEs from motivational, emotional, and heuristic strategies based on the framing effect and cognitive heuristic mechanisms. © 2023 Chinese Psycholocial Society.

The occupational demands of the flying environment require a certain level of medical suitability. Additionally, such an environment could be more hazardous for certain populations. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the World Health Organization strongly support exclusive breastfeeding for the health benefit of both the mother and the child in the first 6 months of life, the aeromedical implications of lactating are not widely discussed. Breastfeeding is inherently challenging for many women, in part because of the frequent emptying required to maintain breastmilk supply and avoid complications such as engorgement, clogged ducts, and mastitis. This pilot study evaluated the experiences of individuals concurrently breastfeeding while on active duty Naval flying status to (1) assess whether these individuals experience frequent challenges or complications associated with lactating and (2) establish the need for future expanded studies. Materials and Methods: This survey-based, retrospective, descriptive study evaluated the experiences of 17 lactating individuals on active duty Naval flying status. Women were recruited using word of mouth and social media platforms. Responses were tabulated and summarized from the survey, which included yes/no questions and free-response sections regarding flying position, breastfeeding history, and breastfeeding challenges. This trial was approved by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Institutional Review Board (Protocol Number NAWCAD.2021.0004-IR-EP7). Results: Of the 27 women who received study materials after expression of interest, 17 individuals completed the informed consent and survey protocols. Although limited by sample size and the demographics of respondents, the results highlight that the active duty flying environment did impact the breastfeeding experiences of the participants, with 88% of respondents reporting some difficulty or complication associated with breastfeeding and the operational flying environment. Difficulty in maintaining breastmilk supply, engorgement, and the need for supplementation were some of the concerns discussed. Conclusions: This study hypothesizes that occupational demands associated with aviation result in a decreased ability to maintain exclusive breastfeeding, an increased risk for engorgement and clogged ducts, and a higher likelihood of early weaning among Naval aviators. It included only the perspectives of Naval officers, thereby lacking the input of enlisted aircrew on flight status, who comprise a large population of active duty flyers. The responses, although limited by a lack of controls and survey limitations, indicate that a future study to expand understanding of the aeromedical implications on lactating individuals would be valuable for improving workplace support and the ultimate success of lactating women in meeting their breastfeeding goals. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

Numerous studies have shown that pilot perception errors are one of the main reasons for a lack of situational awareness without a proper system to detect these errors. The main objective of this study is to examine the changes in pilots’ eye movements during various flight tasks from the perspective of visual awareness. The pilot’s gaze rule scanning strategy is mined through cSPADE, while a hidden semi-Markov model-based model is used to detect the pilot’s visuoperceptual state, linking the correlation between the hidden state and time. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then compared with that of the hidden Markov model (HMM), and the more flexible hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is shown to have an accuracy of 93.55%. © 2023 by the authors."

Standard phraseology provides pilots and air traffic controllers with special phrases to minimize the risk of miscommunication in a multilingual environment. It is designed to facilitate unambiguous and concise radio exchange. In non-standard situations, which are not covered by standard phraseology, the ability to use plain language is a must. The language training aims to ensure that language activity does not distract pilots’ and air traffic controllers’ attention and saves time to make the right decisions. The authors believe that improvement of professionally significant personality traits such as motivation, emotional stability, the accuracy of reaction, thinking elasticity, logical reasoning as well as the ability to process information quickly, select reasonable hypotheses, picture flight environment, predict the development of the situation, and anticipate the result of the activity can be a highly efficient way to reach this goal. The authors also consider soft power skills as an indispensable part of pilots’ skill sets and distinguish the most significant of them. The problem is that the points mentioned above are not included in the pilots’ and air traffic controllers’ language training. Therefore, the research aims to identify a set of professionally significant personality traits and develop ways of their improvement. The most efficient digital resources are distinguished.

What are the issues that these former pilots face upon losing their medical certification? The key issues may take the form of protean career characteristics and mechanisms such as identity, adaptability, and agency, which may help the individuals match to a new occupational environment. The method of convergent interviewing is used to inductively acquire the key common issues that arise when pilots lose their medical certification in Australia. The results indicate that the clarity and strength of the pilots’ sense of occupational identity may amplify the impact of the shock when that career is denied to them. The findings highlight the importance of adaptability, although the reliance on adaptability varies depending on the pathway chosen to respond to the shock.

Better understanding how the human will react in these situations, combined with technological enhancements is vital to risk mitigation and ensuring successful performance. This review will also identify gaps in the literature that have yet to be addressed. Method: A systematic literature review was undertaken, beginning with 18,319 articles from three multidisciplinary databases. After careful review and exclusion, a final sample of 22 relevant articles were retained. This analysis was spread across various high risk, sociotechnical industries, including aviation, rail, mining, nuclear power, etc. Findings: The findings show that previous research has identified cognitive ability, leadership, situation awareness, personality, and risk perception as the most prominently considered factors in reducing accident involvement. Training, skill, situation awareness, and emotional stability were the most commonly associated factors to success through emergencies. Conclusion: While the research around individual differences impacting success during emergencies is scarce, this review provides future direction on potential factors influencing reduced accident involvement and/or potential factors that could influence a person's success through a disaster or emergency. This information could be implemented in recruitment and training of front-line workers in high-reliability organisations to reduce risk, increase safety and work towards reducing the number of accidents. © 2023"

This technology is an important tool for studying pilot's visual attention distribution. From a methodological point of view, the ultimate goal of Eye-tracking technology is to improve the interaction of pilots with electronic flight instrument system (EFIS). The aim of the research was to reveal the peculiarities of attention distribution of cadet-pilots with different levels of training when performing simulator flights taking into account their psychophysiological profile and also to establish a possible relationship between Eye-tracking parameters and flight performance. To achieve this goal experimental flights were performed on simulator DA40 NG FNPT II in Ulyanovsk Institute of Civil Aviation. The psychophysiological study included following tests: Eysenck's personality questionnaire (extra- and introversion, neuroticism), Spielberger state anxiety assessment (STAI) and WAM questionnaire (well-being-activity-mood) which were done before and after simulator flights. During the flight the instructor assessed flying performance considering the maintaining of following flight parameters: speed, heading and altitude. As a result of cluster analysis using K-means method, two clusters of cadet-pilots were identified in each group of participants. Also, a correlation analysis was carried out between Eye-tracking parameters and indicators of flight performance. It is shown that there is a correlation of Reverse Saccades and Fixation Count with indicators of flight performance in two of four identified clusters. Taking into account the development of Eye-tracking studies flight instructors or other personnel involved in the initial pilot training can compare visual attention distribution of cadet-pilots with different level of training taking into account their psychophysiological profile in order to identify the most successful gaze strategies with EFIS. © 2023 Author(s)."

On one hand, different task scenarios seriously affect human's rule of attention distribution, on the other hand, visual attention reflecting the cognitive and psychological process. Most of the previous studies on visual attention allocation are based on cognitive models, predicted models, or statistical analysis of eye movement data or visual images, however, these methods are inadequate to provide an inside view of gaze behavior to reveal the attention distribution pattern within scenario context. Moreover, they seldom study the association rules of these patterns. Therefore, we adopted the big data mining approach to discover the paradigm of visual attention distribution. Methods: We applied the data mining method to extract the gaze patterns to discover the regularities of attention distribution behavior within the scenario context. The proposed method consists of three components, tasks scenario segmented and clustered, gaze pattern mining, and association rule of frequent pattern mining. Results: The proposed approach is tested on the operation platform. The complex operation task is simultaneously segmented and clustered with the TICC-based method and evaluated by the BCI index. The operator's eye movement frequent patterns and their association rule are discovered. The results demonstrate that our method can associate the eye-tracking data with the task-oriented scene data. Discussion: The proposed method provides the benefits of being able to explicitly express and quantitatively analyze people's visual attention patterns. The proposed method can not only be applied in the field of aerospace medicine and aviation psychology, but also can likely be applied to computer-aided diagnosis and follow-up tool for neurological disease and cognitive impairment related disease, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), neglect syndrome, social attention differences in ASD (Autism spectrum disorder). © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"The Carbon Footprint and Cost of Virtual Residency Interviews","2023","Journal of Graduate Medical Education","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148773329&partnerID=40&md5=d7b01830d0be907d4150d210bffa4c76","Background The shift from in-person to virtual residency interviews may impact greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and costs but the direction and amount of this change is not yet clear. Objective To estimate GHGE and financial impacts of virtual interviews among applicants and programs. Methods In 2020-2021 we sent a postinterview survey to 1429 applicants from 7 residency programs and 1 clinical psychology program at 1 institution. The survey collected origin of travel and transit type if in-person interviews had been held and excluded responses if the applicant would not have participated in an in-person interview, or if travel type or original city was missing. We used the International Civil Aviation Organization calculator to estimate flight-related GHGE in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) and Google Maps to estimate ground travel, with a standard CO2e per mile. Flight, hotel, and airport taxi costs were estimated using Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Uber, and Lyft. We aggregated these data and calculated median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for applicant GHGE and cost savings, and assumed no cost or GHGE from virtual interviews. We used Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests to compare in-person 2019-2020 and virtual 2020-2021 GME program interview budgets. Results The survey response rate was 565, or 40% of applicants; 543 remained after the exclusion criteria were applied. Reduction in applicant travel due to virtual interviews led to median estimated GHGE savings of 0.47 (IQR 0.30-0.61) MTCO2e and $490 (IQR $392-$544) per applicant, per interview. Programs savings ranged from $7,615 to $33,670 for the interview season. Conclusions Virtual interviews in 8 GME programs were associated with lower estimated GHGE and costs, for applicants and programs, compared with in-person interviews. © 2023, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

These likely impact cabin crews’ overall health and may affect their performance on safety-related tasks. Research on this population has been limited; therefore, the aim was to summarise the relevant literature regarding fatigue, sleepiness and mental health of cabin crew. This review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and conducted a systematic search utilising five databases. The initial search identified 1223 studies, and through vigorous screening processes, 27 studies were selected for this review. Over half of the selected studies focused on international or long-haul flights, and a large proportion of the sample participants were women. Findings suggested a high prevalence of fatigue and sleepiness as well as unsatisfactory sleep quality with elevated susceptibility to sleep disorders. Factors identified with health outcomes were associated with flight operations (e.g., rosters) and individual differences (e.g., age and coping strategies). Regarding mental health, cabin crews are potentially at a greater risk for depression and anxiety compared to the general public. This review draws attention to the importance of using a standardised approach, such as validated measures for fair and consistent inferences. © 2023 by the authors."

In an idealized flight operation that has become real thanks to the implementation of more and more sophisticated tools, Air Force personnel must deal with the dangers inherent in an aeronautical environment. These specific constraints (the decrease of atmospheric pressure, constraints related to the aircraft, equipment and mission) justify an adaptation of the current medical-psychological training in the armed forces. This preparation is continuous throughout the different stages of an airman's career, both in terms of expertise and medical and psychological support, through a process carried out by different actors, which include the medical service of clinical psychology applied to aeronautics (SMPCAA). It aims to ensure both flight safety and the mental health of the flight crew. The medical-psychological assessment in aeronautics is based on military and international regulations. A qualified psychiatrist, having adequate knowledge and experience in aviation medecine, explores anamnesis and the behavioral, affective and cognitive fields to evaluate the airman's prognosis for adaptation. In addition to the medical history or current psychiatric disorders, the psychiatrist looks for a pathological or delusional personality, contraphobic, escapist, fragile or non-authentic motivation. An airman's mental fitness during their career is more nuanced than their initial mental health which does not take into consideration the necessary adaptation to the job. Medical and psychological support takes place in the continuity of the normal fitness assessment. SMPCAA coordinates this support, with the Air Force's clinical psychology unit (CPC'Air). This unit, which was initially created to carry out post-immediate medical-psychological interventions following serious traumatic events, also provides training, operational psychological support, and psychotherapy. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS"

Pilot training success exhibited small significant positive relationships with conscientiousness and self-confidence and a small negative association with neuroticism. Furthermore, we aimed to examine the moderating effects of four variables. Criterion type was a significant moderator of the relationship between conscientiousness and success, whereas the year of publication did not moderate the association between personality and training success. We descriptively examined two potential moderators: aviation field and personality test type.

Currently, health and wellbeing approaches at an aviation organisational level are not addressing both human and safety needs. This issue has been intensified since the COVID 19 pandemic. This paper reports on the findings of a survey pertaining to aviation worker wellbeing and organisational approaches to managing wellbeing and mental health. The survey was administered at two different time periods during the COVID 19 pandemic (2020 and 2021). Collectively, feedback was obtained from over 3000 aviation workers. Survey feedback indicates that aviation workers are experiencing considerable challenges in relation to their health and wellbeing. These challenges are not being adequately addressed at an organisational level, which creates risk both from an individual and flight safety perspective. The descriptive findings of both surveys along with a regression analysis is used to make a principled case for augmenting the existing approach to managing aviation worker wellbeing (including mental health), at both an organisational and regulatory level. It is argued that aviation organisations, with the support of the regulator should implement a preventative, ethical and evidence-based strategy to managing wellbeing and mental health risk. Critically, aviation organisations need to advance and integrated health, wellbeing, and safety culture. This necessitates an alignment of human, business, and safety objectives, as articulated in concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and responsible work. Critically, this approach depends on trust and the specification of appropriate protections, so that aviation workers feel safe to routinely report wellbeing levels and challenges, and their impact on operational safety. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"The interrelation of psychological characteristics and success of education of cadets of civil aviation","2023","Russian Military Medical Academy Reports","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206390148&partnerID=40&md5=882b6aa8b9268f7974a2706d15bcbe77","BACKGROUND: Historically, the development of professional selection, occupational hygiene, and psychology occurs to the greatest extent in aviation, because it has been proven that up to 50–80% of flight accidents are directly related to the human factor. So, S.E. Mints, an aviation military doctor, after analyzing 364 plane crashes, came to the conclusion that in 90% of cases of disasters, the decisive factor is the individual qualities of pilots. Determining the typical personal characteristics of suitable and unsuitable persons for the flying profession is a rather difficult task facing professional selection specialists. Primary professional training of a pilot is carried out in flight schools and is improved during their further work. One of the main goals of flight training is the formation of a trained pilot with strong professional skills in piloting an aircraft, ensuring flight safety. The study examines the psychological characteristics that affect the success of cadets both in theoretical training and when performing exercises on simulators. AIM: to study the influence of psychological characteristics on the success of training cadets of civil aviation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The statistical analysis of significant differences between “successful” and “less successful” students was carried out according to the following methods: R.B. Kettell’s 16-factor personality questionnaire (form C); Lazarus’ questionnaire “Coping behavior methods”; G. Aizenk’s Personal questionnaire (EPI); The method “Motives for choosing a profession” (author R.V. Ovcharova); Questionnaire “Styles of self-regulation of behavior (author V.I. Morosanova). RESULTS: In theoretical training, those students who are dominated by calmness, self-control, equanimity and emotional stability are more successful. They are characterized by stable interests, developed will and determination, as well as independence, flexibility and non-hostility. The most successful in performing exercises on simulators are students with developed abstract thinking. They are quick-thinking, easy to learn. They are distinguished by determination, enterprise, and activity in achieving goals. These students are ready to act alone, independent and independent. They are characterized by activity, concentration and a high level of motivation. They are characterized by a rational approach to solving problematic situations. CONCLUSION: The most successful in performing exercises on simulators are students with developed abstract thinking. They are quick-thinking, easy to learn. They are distinguished by determination, enterprise, and activity in achieving goals. These students are ready to act alone, independent and independent. They are characterized by activity, concentration and a high level of motivation. They are characterized by a rational approach to solving problematic situations. It was revealed that those students who have the following psychological characteristics are more successful in the course of theoretical training: high indicators on the scales of emotional stability–instability, relaxation–tension, planning, the general level of self-regulation and low indicators on the scale of confrontation, and when performing exercises on simulators: high scores on the scales of intelligence, timidity–courage, conformity–nonconformity, relaxation–tension discipline, self-control, acceptance of responsibility, flexibility, independence and low indicators of the search for social support factor and, according to the scale, internal individually significant motives for choosing a profession. © Eco-Vector, 2023."

However, the number of women leaders increased in the past two years and occupied top level positions in organizations. This demonstrates that women have capabilities as men, and it indicates that they are effective leaders. Effective leaders are intertwined with their personalities, context and situations that shape their leadership style. Therefore, we are interested to explore which leadership style is suitable for women’s leadership in crisis in response to future challenges. Review of literature was conducted to address the research question. Nvivo12 is adopted to assist the analysis process. As a result, it is found that transformational leadership style is suitable for women’s leadership in crisis since this leadership style is future-oriented, fast response, and provide direction to group members. Additionally, transformational leadership style accommodates the characteristics of women’s leadership style. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."

Seuil, 1998). More specifically, high-risk jobs require increased resistance to stress (Rivolier, Facteurs humains et situations extrêmes. Editions Masson, 1992). Thus, stress assessment before hiring regarding specific jobs of within the French Air Force (FAF) is critical. Firstly, we describe specificity of occupational stress in high-risk jobs, “the factors in the individual’s work conditions and domestic situation that cause stress” (Green et al., Human factors for pilots (2nd ed.).

Military Psychology, 24(3), 285–307, 2012), and (3) several types of interviews. The assessment protocols are designed to gather clusters of evidence so as to evaluate emotional stability, emotional regulation and the adjustment to stress. They also permit investigation of applicants’ strengths and weaknesses about regarding coping skills. Finally, these latter factors are discussed, in order to value the overall efficiency, in the interests of both applicants and the military institution. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

In this context, flight schools need adapted tools to train pilots, most importantly with regard to their own awareness of their physiological and cognitive limits. In civil and military aviation, pilots can train on realistic simulators to tune their reaction and reflexes, but also to gather data on their piloting behavior and physiological states, helping to improve their performance. As opposed to cockpit scenarios, drone teleoperation is conducted outdoors in the field, with only limited potential from desktop simulation training. This work aims to provide a solution to gather pilot behavior in the field and help them increase their performance. We combined advanced object detection from a frontal camera with gaze and heart rate variability measurements. We observed pilots and analyzed their behavior over three flight challenges. We believe this tool can support pilots both in their training and in their regular flight tasks. © 2023 IEEE."

The first research was carried out before the First World War and has gained importance, especially in the last 20 years, due to the dynamic growth of civil air transport. The selection of military pilots in the Czech Air Force environment takes place within the framework of the admission procedure for study at the University of Defence (UoD) in the specialization of military pilot (MP). The selection includes medical tests, psychological tests, and knowledge tests. This paper aims to verify the suitability of using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) test battery in a shortened form to design and implement a new objective system for selecting candidates for the military pilot specialization. Current MP specialization students (n=51) and candidates in the 2022/2023 academic year (n=35) were tested. The results showed that most students tested (82%) scored low on the Neuroticism scale, and 16% are in the broader average range. On the Conscientiousness scale, a majority of the students (63%) scored high, 37% of the students were in the normal range, and none of the respondents were in the below-average range. The analysis shows that 55% of the subjects have low Neuroticism scores and high Conscientiousness scores. The pilot testing has fulfilled its purpose; there has been a validation of the tools that can be used to define the prerequisites to achieve the desired abilities and skills for the MP specialization.

While data exist on the occupational stressors of firefighters and public safety personnel in general, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the experiences of airport firefighters, particularly in relation to their organizational stressors, peer supports and attitudes toward mental health treatment. Methods: We conducted two focus groups with 10 career firefighters working at an airport in Atlantic Canada in 2019. Focus groups were recorded; the recordings were transcribed and later coded using thematic analysis, which took an inductive, iterative, narrative approach. Results: Airport firefighters face unique challenges, and operational stressors are overshadowed by organizational stressors. Additionally, peer support is an integral aspect of coping with both organizational stressors and critical incidents. Firefighters were found to have positive attitudes toward mental health treatment in general, but several barriers still remain, such as stigma, fear of being placed on leave and fear of confidentiality breach. Conclusion: Specialized treatment options for public safety personnel and airport firefighters who engage in serious incidents outside of their regular duties are needed. © 2023, Public Health Agency of Canada.

"A Disruptive Approach to CRM and Situational Awareness Competencies","2023","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176780055&partnerID=40&md5=49e53e3e4bfd28ddba3e0a0fcf9c54cc","Research has shown that lack of non-technical skills (also called, Crew Resource Management - CRM) contributes to most personal and process safety incidents in high-risk industries. Situational awareness in the most influential non-technical skill. Authors developed a disruptive program to generate situational awareness competencies and improve non-technical skills of front-line employees. The program is called: Permanent Attention. It combines best practices adapted from high-risk industries and industrial psychology science to generate statistically significant improvements in situational awareness competencies through a sustainable approach. The paper shows real case applications from two organizations where the Permanent Attention program has generated significant improvement in the participants' situational awareness competency and nontechnical skills (CRM) acquisition and retention. The program is executed with the learner at the centre of the process. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT, Endsley, and Garland, 2000) is used to measure the levels of situational awareness competency before and after the training, to determine the impact achieved through the program. The 'Repeated measures - ANOVA' statistic model is used to scientifically demonstrate the significant impact of the process in the three elements of situational awareness: Attention, Comprehension and Anticipation. The training sessions in-between SAGATs contain theoretical information and practical exercises that equip the participant(s) with fundamentals. Exercises for each element of the situational awareness have been designed to obtain optimal skills. To complement the practice of non-technical skills, employees are exposed to simulations of critical operational situations, so they can demonstrate their leadership, communications, teamwork, decision-making skills in group and learn how to manage stress in such situations. The levels of situational awareness competencies are periodically monitored via practical field-based SAGAT exercises after the training, to ensure a sustained improvement in the participants' competencies. The feedback provided immediately after each SAGAT is key to let the participant focus on the element(s) of situational awareness that require improvement. Once the feedback is received, the participant is requested to self-evaluate her level on each element of situational awareness. This reinforces self-consciousness and encourages a sense of commitment to improve by conviction, not by imposition. This novel methodology gives the organization a clear metric on the return on the investment the program offers and allows very specific interventions to improve individual and group level non-technical skills across the organization. A truly disruptive method. The paper shows how the Permanent Attention instructional design combines Endsley's research from the aviation and nuclear industries, with Knowles' andragogy (2015) theory to achieve competency acquisition and retention. Novel approaches such as the SAGAT, are used with scenarios that are familiar to the target population. Participants' levels of situational awareness competency are measured before and after the training to determine whether a statistically significant impact was achieved through the program. Permanent Attention has been implemented in organizations with a wide range of maturity. Case-studies are presented to illustrate the process, results, and limitations in two leading drilling companies, in which 60 to 70% of incidents had situational awareness as a contributing factor, over last five years. The implementation of the program has brought statistically significant improvements in the competency of employees and the pilot in Colombia has shown early signs of accident reduction. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."

Why should we be concerned about how stress can be simulated? The answer is simple and almost trivial: because many professionals regularly tackle crisis situations such as accidents and it is necessary to train them for stress management. One of the possibilities is to engage them in a process of habituation to the stress factors so that these individuals learn how to manage the consequences of these factors. This chapter suggests tools for this aim. It presents a method to identify stressors and a method to assess how certain actions can increase their effects. Examples of application are given in medicine, in the nuclear industry, in military aviation, and in robotics intervention.

This can result in poor decision-making, as well as a decrease in comprehension, perception, and judgment, leading to the inability to perform the necessary duty as a pilot. Many aviation accidents and incidents are caused by mental incapacitation, particularly when the pilots are suddenly surprised or startled. To better understand this phenomenon, an experiment is being conducted to identify physiological, behavioral, and personality indicators that may explain individual susceptibility to mental incapacitation caused by sudden stressful events. Volunteer pilot students participate in a two-part process: (1) a personality and cognitive evaluation phase, where mental stress is manipulated, and (2) a flight simulator phase in which a sudden, surprising event (an intense thunder sound with a flash of lightning) takes place. Physiological, behavioral, and subjective evaluations are collected to determine the potential correlations and precursors of mental incapacitation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"Study on Temperament Characteristics of Air Traffic Controllers Based on BP Neural Network","2023","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171466892&partnerID=40&md5=303a1a03767504d8b7d8ecbbd7713cd4","The working characteristics of air traffic controllers are closely related to their temperament type. The selection of controllers, controller posts, and the composition of controller teams should all consider the adapta-bility of temperament. Therefore, it is crucial to study the distribution of temperament types among air traffic controllers to ensure the safety of control system operations and to prevent civil aviation accidents. In this study, we used the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) to conduct a questionnaire survey of air traffic controllers and compared the results to a national norm control group. Our analysis demonstrated that the tem-perament type of air traffic controllers differs significantly from that of ordinary people. We concluded that the most suitable temperament types for control work are polysanguine, mucinous, choleric, and depres-sive, in that order. Finally, we developed a fitting model based on a BP neural network to assess the suitability of individual controllers for spe-cific control positions. We used the questionnaire data to establish a da-ta set and selected the minimum root mean square error as the loss function for back propagation training. The simulation analysis con-firmed the effectiveness of the fitting model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"A Measurement Framework and Method on Airline Transport Pilot’s Psychological Competency","2023","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171465711&partnerID=40&md5=85cb7c5b42937f642ca23e6ceb7b85a3","Based on the professional characteristics of airline transport pilots and requirements of implementing pilots’ Professionalism Lifecycle Management (PLM) system put forward by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), this study proposes the measurement framework and method on airline transport pilot’s psychological competency by consulting the relevant results of psychological competency and psychological assessment of pilots. Firstly, this study points out that the psychological competency of airline transport pilots mainly includes two measurement dimensions: professional adaptability and mental health, covering five measurement modules: general cognitive ability, operational and professional ability, social-interpersonal ability, personality traits and attitude, and mental health. Secondly, this study provides the complete process of psychological competency evaluation for pilots, and the measurement data of the pilot can be obtained through supporting hardware and software devices for evaluation and analysis. Finally, this study designs an index fusion algorithm of pilot’s psychological competency, integrates the data obtained by the objective measurement algorithm and the subjective measurement algorithm, and calculates the score value of the pilot's psychological competency after standardized calculation, combined with the psychological competency measurement framework. The research conclusion shows that the measurement framework and method on airline transport pilot’s psychological competency proposed in this study have certain applicability, and can be widely applied in the next step, providing direct technical support and input for the development of reliable civil aviation pilot selection, evaluation and training tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Suitability of Physiological, Self-report and Behavioral Measures for Assessing Mental Workload in Pilots","2023","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171457197&partnerID=40&md5=6bc258e28a7d81e96d45c9b88c182475","Adaptive automation shall support users in a flexible way. One way to achieve this could be by monitoring cognitive states of pilots in order to anticipate an individual’s need for support. A special challenge lies in choosing methods that enable a valid measurement of the cognitive state in question since different measures are associated with distinct strengths and weaknesses. For example, practical considerations like environmental factors, wearing comfort and intrusiveness have to be considered. The objective of this paper is to provide a collection of physiological, self-report and behavioral measures that can be applied to assess mental workload in pilots, and to discuss their advantages and disadvantages for this purpose. A targeted literature search was conducted to this end. The comparisons drawn in this paper reveal that a multi-method approach is preferable to relying on a single measure. In this regard, however, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and it is strongly advised to consider the selection of appropriate measures carefully for each specific research question and application context. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Resilience coping flexibly with novel events and avoiding failures or worst-case scenarios is concretely defined as four-resilience potential (RP), which are responding, monitoring, learning, and anticipating. In this research, we aim to realize a human-system interaction to support the improvement of RP of workers. As the first step, we conducted a cognitive experiment to characterize workers' RP when they must respond to a significant situation change. In the experiment, we classified participants into two groups: an HS group with high Non-Technical Skill (NTS) and an LS group with low NTS. The results revealed the following: (1) The correlation between NTS and task performance is low under normal conditions, (2) In an emergency when significant changes in circumstances occur, the HS group may have relatively higher RP than the LS group, and (3) The HS group always tends to perform tasks with an awareness of the target values and a detailed understanding of the situation. These characteristics of the HS group may contribute to demonstrating resilient performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

And pilots, as the first person responsible for ensuring flight safety, need to be given real-time attention from the process of selection, training and flying. Mental state and psychological quality are invisible presences that are often easily overlooked, but they have a direct impact on flight safety. The developed countries in the foreign aviation industry have now placed equal importance on pilot psychological training and skills training. In this paper, by studying the psychological influencing factors of civil aviation pilots regarding flight safety, important indicators of pilot psychology affecting civil aviation flight safety are established. Running the hierarchical analysis method, the index weights of pilot psychological competency were determined. According to the judgment matrix constructed, the weights of the primary and secondary indicators were determined and a pilot psychological competency assessment model was established. © 2023 IEEE."
"Do applicants from Generation X, Y, Z differ in personality traits? data from selection procedures in aviation (1987–2019)","2023","Frontiers in Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168269581&partnerID=40&md5=55634658bffa275ed866ad29c6824e76","Introduction: The objective of this study is to research personality trait differences across generations and the impact of age, gender and self-presentation on these traits. Methods: A total of 82,147 applicants (aged 17–24) for aviation training (pilot, air traffic controller), born between 1965 and 2002, were divided into three cohorts (Generation X, Y, Z). We analysed data from the temperament structure scales (TSS) personality questionnaire, which was collected during selection procedures between 1987 and 2019. Generational differences were analysed by ANCOVAs with generation and gender as group factors, controlled by age and self-presentation (social desirability). Results: Age had no significant impact, but we observed slight gender differences in emotional stability, vitality, empathy, and self-presentation across all generations. The generational differences found exhibited extremely small effect sizes, suggesting that applicants have become more extraverted, controlled (with lower aggression and higher rigidity), and inclined to present themselves in a more favourable manner. Discussion: We discuss the implications of these findings for the aviation industry and the applicability of Generation theory in personality trait research. © © 2023 Stelling."

Methods A total of 44 officers and soldiers of an army aviation brigade were selected by cluster sampling and then divided into intervention group (n=22) and control group (n=22). The intervention group received 2 hours' mindfulness intervention course once a week for 8 consecutive weeks, while the control group were given mental health education at same frequency and duration. Then the participants were assessed with self-compiled demographic scales, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), Attention to Positive and Negative Information Scale (APNIS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) before intervention (T1), at the end of the intervention (T2), and 1 month after the intervention (T3), respectively. Results There were no significant differences in the demographic data and psychological indicators between the 2 groups before training. After intervention, the scores of mindfulness level, cognitive reappraisal, positive attention bias and depression were significantly different between the 2 groups in terms of measurement time and group interaction (P<0.05). The scores of mindfulness level and the cognitive reappraisal scores were greatly higher at T2 and T3 than T1 (P<0.01, P<0.05), and the positive attention bias score at T2 was also notably higher than that of T1 (P<0.05) in the intervention group. In addition, no significant difference was observed in the depression score at the 3 time points in the intervention group, while in the control group, the score was obviously higher at T3 than T2 and T1 (P<0.05, P<0.01). Conclusion Mindfulness-based intervention significantly improves the level of mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and positive attentional bias, and relieves the impact of military training and management on depression of the army aviation officers and soldiers to a certain extent. © 2023 Editorial Office of Journal of Third Military Medical University.

Pilot mental health has received increased attention since Germanwings Flight 9525; however, this research has largely focused on general anxiety, depression, and suicide and relied on a questionnaire-based methodology. This approach is likely to miss various mental health issues that may affect pilot wellbeing, leaving the prevalence of mental health issues in aviation unclear. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a particular impact on the mental health and wellbeing of pilots, who experienced the devastating effect of COVID-19 on the industry. Method: In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of 73 commercial pilots during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the DIAMOND semi-structured diagnostic interview and explored possible associated vulnerability and protective factors, including life event stressors, personality, passion, lifestyle factors, and coping strategies. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on aviation during the time of this study, affecting 95% of participants. The diagnostic results revealed over one third of pilots had symptoms of a diagnoseable mental health disorder. Anxiety disorders were the most commonly found disorders, followed by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Adjustment Disorder, and Depressive Disorders. Pilots’ high life event scores placed them at an increased risk for the development of stress-related illness, though did not explain which pilots had mental health difficulties in this study. Regression analysis supported a diathesis-stress model for pilot mental health, with disagreeableness and obsessive passion contributing to pilots’ development of mental health issues, and nutrition as the most important protective factor. Discussion: This study, though limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, provides a valuable precedent for a more thorough assessment of pilot mental health, and contributes to the broader understanding of pilot mental health, including suggestions to target factors associated with the development of mental health issues. © © 2023 Ackland, Molesworth and Grisham."

The use of a multimodal stress management protocol for all stages of the relocation process, including appropriate and effective anxiolytic medication where necessary, is therefore important in order to safeguard the cat’s welfare while travelling. Clinical challenges: Cats may be presented to veterinarians for the purpose of preparing them and/or their documentation for air travel. Maintaining and protecting a cat’s physical, mental and emotional health in a stressful environment, while subjected to likely unfamiliar sights, noises, smells and the movement of the aircraft, and additionally dealing with international legislation, regulations and documents, can pose a complex challenge to veterinarians. Aims: This review describes the importance of stress management during air travel for cats, aims to raise awareness about the often poorly understood challenges involved, and outlines effective and airline-compliant stress management modalities. While the discussion is focused on air travel specifically, the stress management methods described can be applied to all types of longer distance travel, such as a long road trip or a ferry crossing, as well as a stay in a holiday home. Evidence base: There are currently no studies specifically on air travel in cats and, similarly, there are also limited data on air travel in other species. Many of the recommendations made in this review are therefore based on the authors’ extensive experience of preparing pets for travel, supported by published data when available. © The Author(s) 2023."

Errors made by air traffic controllers in emergencies are explained primarily by lack of professionalism or low stress resistance. Since psychological testing is the first step in screening out candidates unfit for the job, the task of identifying candidates with low performance in emergencies is important and relevant. In order to study methods for assessing emergency performance, an experiment was conducted using the expert and navigator simulators. Also, to analyze the innate component of stress resistance in the participants, personality assessment tests were carried out in order to determine their neuroticism scores. The acquired component of emergency performance was assessed indirectly by comparing how accurately the participants evaluated the risks of potential conflict situations with expert assessments. An analysis was performed of the correlations between experimental results. The experiment was conducted on a sample of 20 fifth-year students at Saint Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation who major in air traffic management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Eighteen commercial pilots voluntarily participated in a 2-day training course on QCT followed by 2 months of self-regulated QCT practicing during controlled rest in the flight deck and day-to day life. There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots’ psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots’ mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique. Practitioner summary: QCT breathing has been proven to increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental/physical capacity and sustaining positive emotions to deal with the challenges both on the flight deck and in everyday life.HIGHLIGHTS Pilots have suffered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across many factors including social, economic, mental, physical, emotional, and operational issues Biofeedback training can increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental and physical capacity Self-regulated practicing QCT to form a habitual behaviour is required to sustain the maximum benefits either in the flight or day-to-day life QCT is an effective intervention for aviation authorities and airline operators to develop peer support programs to increase pilots’ fatigue resilience. © 2022 The Author(s).

Indeed, risk attitudes have been considered as a risk factor for aviation accidents. In this context, emotions and coping style are key variables which could influence concentration by affecting cognition and attention. In addition, the specific training backgrounds seemed to be associated with differences in in-flight accident rates. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between age, sex, flight experience, emotional dysregulation, coping styles, flight licenses, and pilots’ risk attitudes. Methods: Eighty pilots completed an online survey composed of ad hoc questionnaire for sociodemographic and work-related information’s and self-report questionnaires that assessed emotional dysregulation, coping styles, and risk attitudes. Results: Results showed that older age and emotional dysregulation were associated with higher risk attitudes in pilots. Moreover, emotional dysregulation seemed to promote worse self-confidence. Ultralight pilots appeared to be more risk-oriented and less self-confident than civil pilots, while more flight experience appeared to favorite greater self-confidence. Discussion: In conclusion, the study suggests the importance of promoting interventions based on sharing pilots’ difficulties and emotions and promoting safe attitudes with special attention to ultralight pilots, age, and sex differences. © © 2022 Luciani, Veneziani, Ciacchella, Rocchi, Reho, Gennaro and Lai."

The objectives of this review of academic and grey literature were to:1.Identify the impact of occupational exposure to wildland fires on physical, mental, and emotional health; and2.Examine the characteristics and effectiveness of prevention, mitigation, or management strategies studied to reduce negative health outcomes associated with occupational exposure to wildland fire. Methods: Following established scoping review methods, academic literature as well as government and industry reports were identified by searching seven academic databases and through a targeted grey literature search. 4679 articles were screened using pre-determined eligibility criteria. Data on study characteristics, health outcomes assessed, prevention or mitigation strategies studied, and main findings were extracted from each included document. The results of this scoping review are presented using descriptive tables and a narrative summary to organize key findings. Results: The final sample was comprised of 100 articles: 76 research articles and 24 grey literature reports. Grey literature focused on acute injuries and fatalities. Health outcomes reported in academic studies focused on respiratory health (n = 14), mental health (n = 16), and inflammation and oxidative stress (n = 12). The identified studies evaluated short-term outcomes measuring changes across a single shift or wildland fire season. Most research was conducted with wildland firefighters and excluded personnel such as aviation crews, contract crews, and incident management teams. Five articles reported direct study of mitigation strategies, focusing on the potential usage of masks, advanced hygiene protocols to reduce exposure, fluid intake to manage hydration and core temperature, and glutamine supplementation to reduce fatigue. Conclusions: While broad in scope, the evidence base linking wildland fire exposure to any one health outcome is limited. The lack of long-term evidence on changes in health status or morbidity is a clear evidence gap and there is a need to prioritize research on the mental and physical health impact of occupational exposure to wildland fire. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Background: In affective experience studies, people’s evaluation of a period of experience is strongly influenced by the most intense (peak) point and the endpoint. However, whether the effects exist in mental workload evaluations made by professional operators is still not known. Method: In Study 1, 20 ATCos performed air traffic control scenarios on high-fidelity radar simulators and reported their mental workload. We used a 2 (high peak, low peak) × 2 (high end, low end) within-subject design. In Study 2, another group of 43 ATCos completed a survey asking them to predict their mental workload given the same air traffic control scenarios. Results: In Study 1, ATCos reported higher mental workload after completing the high-peak and the high-end scenarios. In contrast, in Study 2, ATCos predicted the peak workload effect but not the end workload effect when asked to predict their experience in dealing with the same scenarios. Conclusion: Peak and end effects exist in subjective mental workload evaluation, but experts only had meta-cognitive awareness of the peak effect, and not the end effect. Application: Researchers and practitioners that use subjective workload estimates for work design decisions need to be aware of the potential impact of peak and end task demand effects on subjective mental workload ratings provided by expert operators. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

"COVID-19 in Memes: The Adaptive Response of Societies to the Pandemic?","2022","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139976543&partnerID=40&md5=8ac4e6d9c3dc22d20324d06a77417a80","COVID-19 expanded rapidly throughout the world, with enormous health, social, and economic consequences. Mental health is the most affected by extreme negative emotions and stress, but it has been an underestimated part of human life during the pandemic. We hypothesized that people may have responded to the pandemic spontaneously with increased interest in and creation of funny internet memes. Using Google and Google Trends, we revealed that the number of and interest in funny internet memes related to COVID-19 exploded during the spring 2020 lockdown. The interest in coronavirus memes was positively correlated with interest in mortality due to COVID-19 on a global scale, and positively associated with the real number of deaths and cases reported in different countries. We compared content of a random sample of 200 coronavirus memes with a random sample of 200 non-coronavirus memes found on the Internet. The sentiment analysis showed that coronavirus memes had a similar proportion of positive and negative words compared to non-coronavirus memes. However, an internet questionnaire revealed that coronavirus memes gained higher funniness scores than a random sample of non-coronavirus memes. Our results confirm that societies may have turned to humor to cope with the threat of SARS-CoV-2. © 2022 by the authors."
"Peripheral vision in real-world tasks: A systematic review","2022","Psychonomic Bulletin and Review","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130487981&partnerID=40&md5=7714af8334ad7c8676a768510650cc89","Peripheral vision is fundamental for many real-world tasks, including walking, driving, and aviation. Nonetheless, there has been no effort to connect these applied literatures to research in peripheral vision in basic vision science or sports science. To close this gap, we analyzed 60 relevant papers, chosen according to objective criteria. Applied research, with its real-world time constraints, complex stimuli, and performance measures, reveals new functions of peripheral vision. Peripheral vision is used to monitor the environment (e.g., road edges, traffic signs, or malfunctioning lights), in ways that differ from basic research. Applied research uncovers new actions that one can perform solely with peripheral vision (e.g., steering a car, climbing stairs). An important use of peripheral vision is that it helps compare the position of one’s body/vehicle to objects in the world. In addition, many real-world tasks require multitasking, and the fact that peripheral vision provides degraded but useful information means that tradeoffs are common in deciding whether to use peripheral vision or move one’s eyes. These tradeoffs are strongly influenced by factors like expertise, age, distraction, emotional state, task importance, and what the observer already knows. These tradeoffs make it hard to infer from eye movements alone what information is gathered from peripheral vision and what tasks we can do without it. Finally, we recommend three ways in which basic, sport, and applied science can benefit each other’s methodology, furthering our understanding of peripheral vision more generally. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The effect of SARS-COV-2 disease has caused a decrease in the economy as businesses, transportation, aviation, and industries have been halted. Many people have died, and many are trying to survive this pandemic. As we all know, the virus of SARS-COV-2 can be transmitted through physical contact, and the government has taken up specific measures like closing up schools and colleges, closing up malls/markets/public places, and imposing lockdown in cities. It is expected that these measures can result in a decreased infection rate. On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 Has halted economic or developmental growth, but on the other hand, our nature i. e. our earth, is being provided with such conditions that it can restore its losses. Air quality has been improved in the lock down time. The emission level of different gases and particulate matters have slowed down in the Covid period. Water bodies have been clean and more transparent and propagate wildlife and fisheries. Due to the SARS-COV-2 lockdown, businesses and industries have halted, impacting the financial needs of many people around the world. The worry about surviving this pandemic and the financial crisis leads them to mental and emotional distress. This review article summarized the emergence of SARS-COV-2 disease and its role on human physical and psychological health.

Notably, the aviation industry is seeing increased research initiatives to promote DEI among all generations. Nevertheless, given the rising concerns about mental health in higher education, this paper sought to connect coping and addressing mental health through implementing DEI teachings in aviation education. Integrating DEI in the aviation classroom can be challenging, as many faculty members might feel uncomfortable addressing the topic in their courses. Consequently, the researchers proposed and tested an aviation education approach incorporating Talking, Teaching, Tools, and Taking Care to facilitate the capstone course for graduating seniors in Aeronautical Science.

"The Cognitive Factors of Auditory Alarms Deafness; 听觉警报失聪的认知因素","2022","Journal of Psychological Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018758406&partnerID=40&md5=5f987767d0544136e163dda7fa1afd93","Inattentional deafness refers to that individual Signore the unexpected auditory stimuli while concentrating on their tasks. This phenomenon is common among our daily life, and it is a major threat to aviation and traffic safety. In aeronautics, auditory alarms can provide emergency information for pilots and air-traffic controllers. The analysis of air safety reports indicated that many aviation accidents were due to the lack of response to unexpected and critical auditory alarm. Why does inattentional deafness happen? Human factor engineering reported three reasons to explain this phenomenon. First, pilots mistrusted the alerting system due to higher false rate, which was akin to cry-wolf effect. Second, the aggressive, distracting and annoying nature of auditory alarms increased the level of stress of pilots. They didn't think about the meaning of alarms but closed the noise. Finally, for pilots, the ability to perceive auditory alarm became poorer due to frequent noise exposures and aging issues. Nevertheless, these explanations are often reported in aviation accidents analysis and are not sufficient to fully explain why a pilot ignores the unexpected and critical auditory alarm. Cognitive psychology showed that the perceptual load, cognitive load and working memory played an important role in inattentional deafness. In the cockpit, pilots must simultaneously monitor many instruments, perceive, process, memorize and retrieve an important amount of information, which causes higher perceptual load and cognitive load. Perceptual load theory indicated that higher perceptual load tasks consumed most of attentional resources, leaving little or none remaining for processing unexpected information. Cognitive control theory showed that working memory had a key role in attention control. Some studies found that the effect of working memory load on inattentional deafness was the opposite of perceptual load and tasks involving high working memory load consumed working memory resources, leaving litter or none remaining for suppressing distractions or unexpected stimuli. Hence, auditory alarms can be perceived under higher working memory load. However, other studies showed that working memory protected distraction by exerting top-down control. Pilots cannot perceive the unexpected auditory alarms under higher working memory load. Neurophysiological studies found that the amplitudes of N100 was reduced under higher working memory load and these studies indicated that the unexpected alarm was filtered at an early processing stage, while some studies showed that the amplitudes of P300 was reduced under higher working memory load and the unexpected alarm could be processed in late processing stage. In the current study, we reviewed the papers and found that perceptual load, cognitive load, working memory, task-related, and visual dominance took accounts to this phenomenon. Perceptual load studies found that the exhaustion of resources under higher perceptual load caused unexpected auditory stimuli to be filtered at an early processing stage. From the aspect of cognitive control, the unexpected auditory stimuli can be processed in late processing stage. The top-down cognitive control took a dominant role in auditory stimuli misperception. Future studies can extend their paradigms and theoretical frameworks to other safety fields. Moreover, further studies can explore how to avoid inattentional deafness through cognitive training. © 2022 Chinese Psycholocial Society. All rights reserved."
"Mental health implications for aviators from COVID-19","2022","REACH","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141969918&partnerID=40&md5=46ea5f75d031d3a4f2f60d31d13bacba","Objective: The authors present aeromedical implications from COVID-19 disruptions on the civil aviation sector, consider mental health impacts on pilots, and discuss possible helpful responses to support pilot mental health. Methods: A multiple database review investigated articles from January 2002 to May 2021 on severe commercial aviation disruptions impacting pilot mental health and on pilot mental health coping or treatment. Fifteen papers were identified. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, airline flights were severely reduced. By January 2021, airlines shed thousands of jobs and 24 airlines no longer existed. General population surveys found 13% of individuals had “serious distress” from the pandemic. In two aviation focused surveys, 40–66% of pilots agreed or strongly agreed that their mental health worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to past Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients, more COVID-19 patients have mental health symptoms in the acute phase of illness; while about 10% of COVID-19 patients appear to have chronic or “long haul” symptoms. Mental Health treatment and coping strategies found helpful to pilots are discussed. Conclusions: Pilots remain at risk for mental health symptoms and illness due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For those who develop severe distress or mental illness from the effects of the pandemic (or COVID-19 infection), early treatment with psychotherapy and/or approved medications may be warranted. This may decrease the likelihood of persistent physical or cognitive or mental health symptoms that would delay a return to flying status. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH"

Methods From January to March 2021， a cluster sampling method was used to select 143 airline pilots in service as the research objects. The self-made emotion and stress source questionnaire， Chinese version of stress perception scale （CPSS）， self rating Anxiety Scale （SAS） and self rating Depression Scale （SDS） were used to investigate the airline pilot population. 136 valid questionnaires were collected， with an effective recovery rate of 95.1% . The measurement data conform to the normal distribution and are expressed by （ｘ ±ｓ ）. T-test and analysis of variance are used for comparison between groups， and Pearson correlation is used for correlation analysis. The data that do not conform to the normal distribution are expressed by the median and quartile [M （Q<inf>1</inf>，Q<inf>3</inf>）]， and the non parametric test is used for the comparison between groups. Multiple linear stepwise regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of pressure perception. In addition， Amos 23.0 software was used to construct structural equation models of stress perception and negative emotions. Results Under the background of the epidemic， the main sources of stress for civil aviation pilots are： the risk of possible reduction in income， the risk of contracting COVID-19， the pressure at work， and the risk of possible slow progress of upgrading. Among them， the first co pilot was more worried about the possible reduction of income than the instructor （P=0.009）； The first co pilot and the captain of the airline were more worried about the possible slowdown of the upgrade progress than the instructor （P< 0.001， P=0.014）. The mean pressure perception of pilots was higher than that of Chinese norm （t=3.11， P= 0.002）. The standard scores of anxiety and depression were slightly higher than the standard scores of the Chinese norm under the non epidemic situation （t=7.00， 4.07， all P<0.001）. The results of multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed that stress perception was negatively correlated with good family relations （t =-8.50， P =0.000）， and positively correlated with worries about slow progress of upgrading， COVID-19 infection， lack of interpersonal communication and income reduction （t =3.31、3.86、2.88、2.06， P <0.05）. Pressure perception was positively correlated with negative emotion （all P<0.001）. The results of structural equation model show that stress perception affects pilots' negative emotions directly or indirectly， and its standardized total effects on anxiety， depression， hypochondriac， fear， compulsion and irritability are 0.719，0.811， 0.403， 0.355， 0.295 and 0.244 respectively. Conclusion Public health emergencies have an impact on the mental status of pilots. Should pay attention to the stressors and psychological conditions of pilots in time，and consider formulating measures to relieve the stress of pilots. © 2019 Bulletin of the Chinese Ceramic Society.

An investigation of this incident found that the pilot had a depressive disorder. METHODS: T his systematic review investigated peer reviewed studies of pilot mental health published since 1980. A total of 58 papers were identified. RESULTS: T wo main methodologies have been employed: questionnaires and database record searches. Anxiety, depression, and suicide were the most commonly investigated mental health conditions. There were almost an equal number of studies that found a higher prevalence of psychological symptoms in pilots as those that found a lower prevalence, relative to controls or the general population. Prevalence rates were higher in studies relying solely on questionnaires than in studies employing database record searches. DISCUSSION: Prevalence estimates are closely associated with methodology, so it is difficult to determine the true rate. Factors that might account for low prevalence estimates include under-reporting of symptoms by pilots and a reluctance to diagnose on the part of health professionals. Factors that might account for high prevalence estimates include anonymous assessment, the use of questionnaires that do not align with clinical disorders, and inconsistent cut-off scores. It is recommended that future studies on prevalence use well-validated clinical measures, and that more research be conducted on the effects of particular disorders on job performance. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

Our study examined the effect of aviation sector employees’ emotional contagion levels on organisational identification and the moderating role of career characteristics, such as age differences and seniority, in this effect. Data collected from 296 aviation employees were analyzed using SPSS 25 and SPSS Process Macro programs for determining moderating effects. The findings revealed that emotional contagion has a positive and significant effect on organisational identification. It has been determined that individuals’ age and seniority differences have a moderating role in the effect of emotional contagion on organisational identification. The fact that the scope of the research is a single sector and organisation hinders the findings’ generalizability. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to explain the cause-and-effect relationships between psychological factors. The results proved that positive emotions affect individuals faster than negative emotions and are more effective on OI. Hence, the establishment of an organisational climate dominated by feelings of love and happiness and devoid of feelings of fear and anger is recommended for managers seeking to foster OI. By revealing the implicit relationships among the concepts with empirical evidence, we aim to fill a significant gap, particularly with respect to organisational psychology, and to represent new insights to scholars and practitioners. © 2022, Editura Lumen.

The impact of the pandemic on their mental health was their primary concern, which increased for many active pilots according to their workload. Those infected mainly faced daily tiredness and fatigue. Smoking habits and high body mass index were a predisposition for more physical symptoms. Cabin crew and women generally yielded worse scores than the other groups. Conclusion Fear of infection could explain mental health issues, whereas physical symptoms of those infected could be attributed to long-COVID (coronavirus disease) syndrome.

Decision-makers who are compelled to act in such circumstances, may be informed by some level of analysis if available, or else may have to rely on their unsupported judgement. This paper presents three engineering risk decision-making case studies across a 20 year span from the rail, aerospace, and military aviation contexts, highlighting the fallibilities of using unsupported judgements in an unstructured manner. To help situate this type of decision situation, we provide a descriptive model of the decision space which extends an existing description from the discipline of decision analysis. Furthermore, to help make and describe the distinction between unsupported and supported thinking, we provide another descriptive model, this time drawing parallels with the distinction made between Type 1 and Type 2 reasoning. This model is an extension of the default-interventionist model from cognitive psychology. The paper concludes that there is a pressing need to provide some form of support to engineering decision-makers facing operational decisions under severe time pressure. While the ultimate aim must be to improve the quality of decision-making, improved transparency is an important additional benefit. Increased emphasis on decision justification and self-awareness are suggested as potential ways of improving this situation. A further contribution of this paper is to identify and strengthen linkages between safety science and two other relevant disciplines, decision analysis and psychology. Such linkages make it easier to communicate across traditional disciplinary boundaries and may provide opportunities for interdisciplinary learning or suggest future directions for collaborative research. © 2022"

Aviation training in Indonesia is no exception in experiencing the pandemic's negative impacts, such as disruptions in aviation training, mental health issues, and economic uncertainty. Teachers were forced to adjust instruction from in-person training to online or hybrid learning. This shift increases much concern, especially on the training effectiveness and the quality of its outcome. Perceptions of instructors need to be examined to gain a clearer understanding of the effectiveness and whether there were positive or negative consequences as well as costs from the aforementioned changes. The researchers of this study conducted seven semi-structured interviews with aviation maintenance instructors in Indonesia to determine the challenges of changing teaching methods during COVID-19. Moreover, a questionnaire was collected from 83 students in four maintenance training programs to investigate the COVID-19 learning method changes in their practical skills as learning outcomes. The Incorporation of Technology (T), Individual (I), Pedagogical (P), and Enabling Condition (EC) or 'TIPEC' Framework and Resilience Engineering Framework will be utilized as the basis to develop the questionnaire and to analyze the results of how the students responded to the new learning method.

Finding unfamiliar or unexpected pathology, anatomy, haemorrhage or an iatrogenic organ or structure injury cannot be completely eliminated in the complex surgical environment. It is vital that an appropriate, safe response to these infrequent events takes place to prevent possible further harm to patients. This paper introduces ‘Patient, Procedure, People’, a tool adapted from aviation threat and error management (TEM) training. It allows surgical teams to improve situational awareness (SA), communicate effectively, flatten team hierarchy gradients and improve decision-making before responding to critical events. We review factors contributing to poor decision-making, with resulting errors. These include loss of SA (tunnel vision), acute stress reactions (fight–flight or freeze–hide) and limbic hijacking (surprise and startle events). Events may cause workload to increase beyond cognitive capacity, further exacerbating the situation. After completing initial actions to achieve a temporary ‘place of safety’, surgical teams may use the tool to effectively manage threat or mitigate error. Aviation is a high-reliability organisation that has pioneered human factors research and training. Airline pilots undergo regular simulated emergencies assessment, including mandatory human factors assessment. Although the complexities of the operating theatre do not currently lend themselves to high-fidelity simulation as in aviation, valuable transferrable lessons can be learnt from aviation’s approach to TEM. © 2022 Royal College of Surgeons of England.

"A systematic scoping review and textual narrative synthesis of physical and mixed-reality simulation in pre-service teacher training","2022","Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125576013&partnerID=40&md5=88991bae5de4fe4c348970f9bda351b9","Background: Due to recent lockdown conditions, which restricted opportunities for face-to-face contact and the ability to be physically in schools, the need for novel, safe ways to train pre-service teachers emerged even more pressingly. Whilst virtual simulation has received some attention in pedagogy and its benefits have been demonstrated in many disciplines, there appears to be less synthesized evidence on the use of physical and/or mixed-reality simulation utilized in teacher training. Objectives: The goal of this systematic scoping review was to summarize and synthesize the literature on the use of physical and/or mixed-reality simulation in pre-service teacher training. Methods: A systematic scoping literature review combined with a textual narrative synthesis was undertaken. Ten reference databases were searched in May 2020: Academic search premier, CINAHL, Education Research Complete, Humanities International Complete, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, PsycInfo, Teacher Reference Center, Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus. Results and Conclusions: Following inclusion/exclusion criteria assessment and screening, 13 articles were included for appraisal and synthesis. Seven papers examined physical simulations, while the remainder examined mixed-reality simulations. The evidence from this review suggests that simulation, including physical and mixed-reality types, could be used as a tool to increase confidence, self-efficacy, classroom management skills and communication. Implications: In comparison to other fields (e.g., nursing, medicine and aviation) simulation in education appears to be in its infancy—more large-scale research is needed. At the same time, this review indicates that mixed-reality simulation in particular has the potential for contributing to teacher education, because it offers the potential for learning in various contexts when compared to traditional didactic teaching practices. © 2022 The Authors.

"The relationship between sense of calling and safety behavior among airline pilots: The role of harmonious safety passion and safety climate","2022","Safety Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124976091&partnerID=40&md5=6388d772cf26aaa6ee81b42a25125288","Pilot safety behavior plays a crucial role in airlines safety performance and aviation safety, so it is vital to identify factors that may enhance pilot safety behavior and explore their mechanisms. Drawing upon self-determination theory, this study examines whether, how, and when the sense of calling influences pilot safety behavior from the perspective of occupational psychology. Using a sample of 321 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between sense of calling and pilot safety behavior was mediated by harmonious safety passion and moderated by safety climate. The results indicated that the sense of calling had a positive direct effect on pilot safety behavior and that this relationship was partially mediated by harmonious safety passion. Moreover, safety climate negatively moderates the positive relationship between sense of calling and harmonious safety passion as well as the indirect effect of sense of calling on safety behavior via harmonious safety passion. In particular, sense of calling had a stronger effect on harmonious safety passion and a stronger indirect effect on safety behavior when the safety climate was lower. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for aviation safety management practices are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Impact of aeroplane noise on mental and physical health: A quasi-experimental analysis","2022","BMJ Open","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129410094&partnerID=40&md5=d66e0e6386cdfc3176b0ed9a0609c7f9","Objectives Historically, departures at New York City's LaGuardia airport flew over a large sports complex within a park. During the US Open tennis games, flights were diverted to fly over a heavily populated foreign-born neighbourhood for roughly 2 weeks out of the year so that the tennis match was not disturbed (the € TNNIS' departure). In 2012, the use of the TNNIS departure became year-round to better optimise flight patterns around the metropolitan area. Methods We exploited exogenously induced spatial and temporal variation in flight patterns to examine difference-in-difference effects of this new exposure to aircraft noise on the health of individual residents in the community relative to individuals residing within a demographically similar community that was not impacted. We used individual-level Medicaid records, focusing on conditions associated with noise: sleep disturbance, psychological stress, mental illness, substance use, and cardiovascular disease. Results We found that increased exposure to aeroplane noise was associated with a significant increase in insomnia across all age groups, but particularly in children ages 5-17 (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.12 to 2.39). Cardiovascular disease increased significantly both among 18-44-year-old (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.41 to 1.49) and 45-64-year-old Medicaid recipients (OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.07 to 1.25). Substance use and mental health-related emergency department visits also increased. For ages 5-17,rate ratio (RR) was 4.11 (95% CI=3.28 to 5.16); for ages 18-44, RR was 2.46 (95% CI=2.20 to 2.76); and for ages 45-64, RR was 1.48 (95% CI=1.31 to 1.67). Conclusion We find that increased exposure to aeroplane noise was associated with an increase in diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, substance use/mental health emergencies and insomnia among local residents. ©"

Objective: This research analyses pilots’ described perceptions of stress, fatigue, aviation safety and how regulations like FTL can affect their health and well-being. Method: In total, 119 international pilots described their perceptions of FTL, rosters, aviation safety, and how they relate to fatigue and health. The QCA was conducted to analyse interactions of working conditions, stressors, fatigue, sleep problems and mental health of EASA-based and Australian pilots. Results: Although pilots were rostered for only 60.8% to 62.5% of the legally allowed duty and flight hours/month, 78.6% reported severe or very high fatigue, 22.8% significant depression, 12.3% significant anxiety symptoms, 10.5% reported significant depression and anxiety symptoms. Pilots uttered severe concerns about FTL, sleep restrictions associated with early starts, minimum rest, etc. Pilots also expressed distinct fears regarding more fatigue-related crashes, and how adverse working conditions, work-related and psychosocial stress could impair their health. Conclusions: This QCA provided valuable insights into interactions of working conditions, fatigue, sleep restrictions, physical and mental health. Progressive health impairment due to lack of sleep and accumulated fatigue promote burnout, mental and physical health problems, which not only threaten flight safety, but also sustainability of aviation. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Our case study of 30 sequential aviation patients consists of demographic, clinical, and aviation characteristics plus a 10-year follow-up. Relatively few pilots and other aviation workers self-identified their psychiatric condition. Aviation outcomes associated with psychiatric disorder included personnel injury and/or aircraft damage (three cases), imminent risk without injury or damage (nine cases), impaired aviation functioning without imminent risk (15 cases), and neither risk nor psychiatric disorder or impairment (three cases). Mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders comprised the most common diagnoses. Ten years later, 23 patients were employed (21 in aviation); seven were disabled or deceased. General psychiatrists will find aviation cases clinically familiar but requiring added evaluation for aviation safety and potential interaction with the Federal Aviation Agency and airline supervisors. © © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Ecological observations in the aviation field indicate risk for severe outcomes in complex or pressured situations, while sparse previous research suggests milder negative effects on simple cognitive tasks. Neuroticism is proposed as a factor related to the level of negative effects following startle. Methods: This study examined the effects of startle on performance in a choice reaction time task and analyzed relations between performance, neuroticism, and physiological stress. Results: Our results indicate that reaction time directly following startle was not affected, but reaction time in subsequent trials was significantly slower. Neuroticism and physiological stress were both unrelated to this performance effect. Discussion: We argue that higher complexity/demand tasks are necessary to complement the research on base cognitive functioning in relation to startle. If neuroticism is related to startle effects, this is more likely to be found in these higher demand situations. © 2022 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Power law model for subjective mental workload and validation through air traffic control human-in-the-loop simulation","2022","Cognition, Technology and Work","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105952730&partnerID=40&md5=e0f6829ca7106c370ae681de782ce874","We provide evidence for a power law relationship between the subjective one-dimensional Instantaneous Self Assessment workload measure (five-level ISA-WL scale) and the radio communication of air traffic controllers (ATCOs) as an objective task load variable. It corresponds to Stevens’ classical psychophysics relationship between physical stimulus and subjective response, with characteristic power law exponent γ of the order of 1. The theoretical model was validated in a human-in-the loop air traffic control simulation experiment with traffic flow as environmental stimulus that correlates positively with ATCOs frequency and duration of radio calls (task load, RC-TL) and their reported ISA-WL. The theoretical predictions together with nonlinear regression-based model parameter estimates expand previously published results that quantified the formal logistic relationship between the subjective ISA measure and simulated air traffic flow (Fürstenau et al. in Theor Issues Ergon Sci 21(6): 684–708, 2020). The present analysis refers to a psychophysics approach to mental workload suggested by (Gopher and Braune in Hum Factors 26(5): 519–532, 1984) that was recently used by (Bachelder and Godfroy-Cooper in Pilot workload esimation: synthesis of spectral requirements analysis and Weber's law, SCL Tech, San Diego, 2019) for pilot workload estimation, with a corresponding power law exponent in the typical range of Stevens’ exponents. Based on the hypothesis of cognitive resource limitation, we derived the power law by combination of the two logistic models for ISA-WL and communication TL characteristics, respectively. Despite large inter-individual variance, the theoretically predicted logistic and power law parameter values exhibit surprisingly close agreement with the regression-based estimates (for averages across participants). Significant differences between logistic ISA-WL and RC-TL scaling parameters and the corresponding Stevens exponents as ratio of these parameters quantify the TL/WL dissociation with regard to traffic flow. The sensitivity with regard to work conditions of the logistic WL-scaling parameter as well as the power law exponent was revealed by traffic scenarios with a non-nominal event: WL sensitivity increased significantly for traffic flow larger than a critical value. Initial analysis of a simultaneously measured new neurophysiological (EEG) load index (dual frequency head maps, DFHM, (Radüntz in Front Physiol 8: 1–15, 2017)) provided evidence for the power law to be applicable to the DFHM load measure as well. © 2021, The Author(s)."

This review investigates the prevalence of cardiometabolic health risk factors for airline pilots. Methods: An electronic search was conducted utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE (via OvidSP), CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science for publications between 1990 and February 2022. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using two quality assessment tools for cross-sectional and clinical trial studies. The prevalence of physiological, behavioral, and psychological risk factors was reported using descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 48 studies derived from 20 different countries, reviewing a total pooled sample of 36,958 airline pilots. Compared with general population estimates, pilots had a similar prevalence for health risk factors, yet higher sleep duration, lower smoking and obesity rates, less physical activity, and a higher overall rate of body mass index >25. Conclusions: The research reported substantial prevalence >50% for overweight and obesity, insufficient physical activity, elevated fatigue, and regular alcohol intake among pilots. However, the heterogeneity in methodology and the lack of quality and quantity in the current literature limit the strength of conclusions that can be established. Enhanced monitoring and future research are essential to inform aviation health practices and policies (Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022308287). © 2022 by the authors.

Here, based on large and rich characteristics of equipment operation data, starting from the point of view of the evidence theory, and combining with deep convolution auto-encoder, a deep support evidence statistics method was proposed to realize bearing operation reliability evaluation without failure sample information or due to lack of relevant prior knowledge, such as, distribution function. In traditional evidence or feature acquisition process, a lot of manual interventions or prior knowledge were required. The deep convolution sparse auto-encoder was used to realize automatic acquisition of evidence. With help of the idea of support vector data description, the operation reliability evaluation of a specific equipment was finally completed by statistically comparing the dynamic change process between calibration and process evidence. Then, the proposed method was verified with aviation bearing tests. The results showed that the reliability obtained using the proposed method can better reflect the ""personality"" of bearing operation reliability. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight pilots, including three examiners (as observers of choking). Findings revealed three superordinate themes: choking under pressure, short-term consequences of choking, and long-term consequences of choking. Collectively, choking was found to be a traumatic event with negative short-term consequences and a potential to lead to constructive long-term outcomes. Practical implications of the findings are discussed, suggesting ways to optimize pilots' performance through focusing more on psychoeducation and emotional support of employees after choking. © 2022 Hogrefe.

Once considered a local event to China, it rapidly spread across the globe within a few months, bringing travel between countries to a halt and interfering catastrophically with the aviation industry. Airports and airlines soon discovered that not only were they on the brink of bankruptcy, they also needed furlough their employees, shut down terminals and fleets and, in race to establish new methodologies for public health demands to try to regain some aviation and commerce activity. The airport security sector also suffered, losing manpower, struggling with infected employees, involving staff in safety related duties which were not part of their job description and seeing new stakeholders to set the ‘new security’ agenda for their home court. Focus was diverted from counter-terrorism. Obviously, due to the circumstances, direct operation and development budgets were frozen or re-allocated, so work plans and an array of improvements are now under consideration. The most agile airports set up innovation labs to identy updated technological solutions in supporting daily efforts, especially with the public demand for contactless travel. Soon, some regulators began to introduce regulations, and are trying to set the industry to work on gold standards and platforms, pursuing governmental official confidence that will, in time, translate into authorisation to operate safe travels (especially on international routes, as in some countries domestic traffic has a reasonable volume). This paper analyses civil aviation actors and vectors throughout the pandemic, and offers predictions for the near future trends, especially for aviation security directors. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS."
"Potential Molecular Mechanisms of Electroacupuncture With Spatial Learning and Memory Impairment Induced by Chronic Pain on a Rat Model","2022","Pain Physician","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127803235&partnerID=40&md5=62375fae82a5df19c930370a4c4167fc","Background: It is frequently reported that neuropathic pain is associated with abnormalities in brain function and structure as well as cognitive deficits. However, the contributing mechanisms have remained elusive. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the systemic ultrastructural changes of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) in rats with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) induced by cobra venom, as well as the effects and mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) and pregabalin (PGB) on TN. Study Design: This study used an experimental design in rats. Setting: The research took place in the laboratory at the Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University and Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 12/group): cobra venom (CV), PGB, EA, and sham-operated (SHAM). The development of pain-related behaviors and spatial learning and memory abilities were measured using video recordings and Morris water maze tests, respectively. The ultrastructural changes of the PNS and CNS were examined using transmission electron microscopy. We also screened the differentially expressed genes and proteins in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus using ribonucleic acid sequencing and isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation techniques, respectively. Data for the behavioral tests and molecular biology were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance. Results: The rats in the CV group exhibited long-lasting pain-like behaviors, cognitive deficits, and systemic ultrastructural changes. Both EA and PGB alleviated the chronic pain syndrome, but EA also inhibited the chronic pain-induced cognitive dysfunction and restored normal cellular structures, while PGB was associated with no improvements. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed marcks, pak2 and acat1 were altered in rats with TN but were adjusted back to baseline by EA but not by PGB. Limitations: We examined systemic ultrastructural alterations at different levels of the nervous system; however, the detailed timeline of the damage process was not explicitly delineated. Moreover, the current study provides only preliminary evidence for the neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment resulting from chronic pain. Further research is still necessary (using models such as gene knockout rats and cell cultures) before a detailed mechanism can be postulated. Conclusions: EA treatment may offer significant advantages when compared to PGB for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with chronic pain. Moreover, marcks, pak2 and acat1 may be the potential therapeutic targets of EA. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. All rights reserved."

We conducted a contingent valuation survey with questions on willingness to pay (WTP) in both contexts by administering a web questionnaire to 1038 individuals aged 18 to 80. We conjectured that WTP for a given impact on the number of fatalities would be lower for suicide prevention because suicide, at least to some degree, is the result of individuals’ own decisions. However, this hypothesis was not supported by the within- or between-sample estimates of WTP or by responses to direct questions. Hence, no support is provided for the use of a lower valuation of the impact of suicide prevention than for risk-reducing programs in other fields, such as traffic safety. This implies that the same VSL should be used for evaluating suicide prevention interventions and for risk-reducing programs in other policy areas and funds for the prevention of fatalities should be directed to the area with the lowest cost per life saved. © 2021, The Author(s)."

"Fly me to the moon: from corporate branding orientation to retailer preference and business performance","2022","International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118389610&partnerID=40&md5=eee0b30bf883228db4df639aea2dfc7c","Purpose: The airline aviation industry is both capital-intensive and competitive. Hence, the evolution of the sector needs original marketing strategies. To study the relationships between corporate branding and corporate image, taking into account two views, namely, corporate strategy and corporate expression in airline identity, this paper aims to analyze the main indicators of the corporate branding that affect the outcomes of the corporate image. Design/methodology/approach: To inspect the theories, the foundational configural model was assessed through the perceptions of 395 employees in Indian aviation companies. By using complexity theory, this study matched the concept of equifinality and it examined the data via a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Findings: Findings show that corporate strategy positively influences the corporate image and corporate expression. Corporate expression offers the verbal and visual facets of a brand. Surprisingly, the paper shows that there is no link between corporate expression and corporate image. It also suggests that corporate expression, including corporate community, corporate promise and corporate personality, are all components of a corporate brand and do not influence the corporate image. Finally, the study highlights that corporate image positively affects superior business performance, which influences superior retailer preference. Research limitations/implications: The study identifies the corporate identity’s indicators (corporate strategy and corporate expression) that affect the corporate image, which results in stronger, superior business performance and retailer preference. It suggests that managers in the airline industry should follow the recommendations of this research by adopting more objective and fairer procedures to attain superior business performance and retailer preference. In addition, the continued growth and the financial impact of the airline sector require the use of pioneering branding strategies. Future study is needed in various nations to advance the generalizability of the research findings. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper is the first to study corporate brand, its sub-dimensions (corporate strategy and corporate expression) and their individual links to brand image, which involves experience, relationships and visual identity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The survey incorporated several standardised instruments measuring levels of common mental health issues. Survey analysis indicates that a significant number of aviation workers are suffering from the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The prevalence of psychological anguish for aviation workers is higher than what is reported in the general population. Logistic regression was used to assess the probability of certain health outcomes for two groups – namely, participants working for Irish registered airlines and all other participants. The outcomes included reaching the threshold for clinical levels of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and a life satisfaction/happiness rating greater or equal to the population average reported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD). Statistical analysis indicates that the probability of having major depression and anxiety is higher for those working for Irish registered airlines. Employees of Irish registered airlines are less likely to rate their life satisfaction and happiness level the same or above the OECD average, as compared with all others. However, statistical analysis indicates that working for an Irish registered airline does not either increase or decrease the probability of suicidal ideation. Given that wellbeing is a factor in safe performance, aviation organisations need to develop new approaches to integrating wellbeing and safety culture, and associated safety management processes. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers.

Inventions, such as steam power, lithography, photography, electricity, motor cars, aviation, and cheaper color printing, all contributed to a new exuberance about color. Available pigments and colored products - made possible by new technologies, industrial manufacturing, commercialization, and urbanization – also greatly increased, as did illustrated printed literature for the mass market. Color, both literally and metaphorically, was splashed around, and became an expressive tool for artists, designers, and writers. Color shapes an individual's experience of the world and also how society gives particular spaces, objects, and moments meaning. The 6 volume set of the Cultural History of Color examines how color has been created, traded, used, and interpreted over the last 5000 years. The themes covered in each volume are color philosophy and science; color technology and trade; power and identity; religion and ritual; body and clothing; language and psychology; literature and the performing arts; art; architecture and interiors; and artefacts. © Alexandra Loske, 2021."

The negative impact of isolation and lack of privacy on the psycho-emotional state of a person is shown. Crowding and lack of privacy contradict the social and biological nature of a man. The isolation and crowding factors characteristic of a short-term space flight to another planet were modeled in the ESKIS experiment. The duration of isolation of the gender-mixed crew (4 men + 2 women, 5 out of 6 had no previous experience in experiments with isolation), spent 14 days in crowding. We assumed that for the first time faced with a complex of isolation factors in a hermetic facility, lack of privacy, the subjects would experience anxiety, sleep disorders, which would cause a need for psychological support (PS). It can be obtained both from the social environment and from the use of PS. The PS system developed at IBMP is aimed at reconstructing the natural sensory influx and at making up for the lack of communication with relatives and friends. In the ESKIS experiment, the use of a promising type of PS based on virtual reality (VR) technologies was tested. The data from questionnaires and interviews indicate a possible relationship between the feeling of association with the crew, the amount of communication in the crew and with the Mission control center (MCС) - and the favorable influence of social support among extroverts in conditions of isolation and crowding while introverts prefers VR. The data of objective research methods (such as facial expression analysis using computer tool based on neural network) shows a generally favorable effect of VR for psychological support provided to persons in conditions of isolation and crowding. The described trends require confirmation in further experiments. However, the problem of crowding and lack of privacy is highly relevant for the modern monotonous urban environment, for people who are quarantined for epidemiological reasons and representatives of a number of extreme professions who carry out their activities in isolation from the usual environment. All this determines the relevance of our research topic and the need to develop means of psychological prevention and psychological support. © © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Serov, necessary for mastering the flying profession, and highlights the influence of the professional self on the degree of their success in flight training. The dynamics of changes in the professional self as a component of the professional self-concept among cadets with different levels of success in flight training have been experimentally investigated. The paper also presents the results of the psychological examination of cadets regarding the stable dominant mental state, characteristics of the psychological and sociopsychological levels of the dominant mental state according to the method of L.V. Kulikov (short version) and their relationship with the level of formation of flight skills. Cadets with a high level of success in flight training were characterized by more pronounced increases in average values on the scales “active–passive attitude to the life situation,” “tone: high–low,” “stability–instability of the emotional background” and “satisfaction–dissatisfaction with life in general,” which indicated the formation of more professional self. However, too much increase in the level of the self-concept can lead to negative results. Inadequate self-concept negatively affects the functional state of cadets. In this regard, a personalized approach to the medical support of cadets’ flights and their dynamic observation, taking into account individual psychophysiological characteristics, is relevant. The participation of an aviation doctor in the training of cadets of aviation schools with a pronounced professional self helps the instructor pilot in organizing a personalized approach; the formation and development of professionally important qualities, fostering a well-founded sense of confidence in their abilities, strengths, and capabilities from the very beginning of flight practice; motivation of cadets to strive to improve their flight skills; and assistance in their awareness that the successful completion of the task and flight safety depend on a real assessment of their professional skills and level of flight training. © 2023 Nutritec.

"Aviation’s Approach Towards Pilots’ Mental Health: a Review","2022","International Review of Aerospace Engineering","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151891940&partnerID=40&md5=f3a8c14d583694682ee35b2c5d7b65fe","– Aviation safety is and always will be a primary priority. Technological advancements, improved pilot training, and improved procedures have all played a significant role in this regard over the years. According to several studies, human factors currently account for over 70% of all accidents. As a result, in order to improve aviation safety, the focus should be on the variables that contribute to those errors, with mental health being one of the most critical. Fatigue, stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout are all connected with poor mental health in aviation. This paper presents a systematic review of articles on pilots’ mental health, together with an anonymous survey to 182 pilots focused on understanding how pilots, airlines and aviation organizations handle pilots’ mental health. According to the survey, pilots bear most of the responsibility and are the ones who experience the consequences if their mental health declines. Additionally, it seems that pilots do not view therapy as a viable choice; even though the majority of respondents said they would turn to therapy if they felt the need, many believed that doing so would worsen their mental health. From both the literature review and the survey results, it is concluded that the complex and subjective nature of mental health imply that this is not a job for any single organization, but that a collective work across all the aviation industry is needed, for which all must be responsible.

There have been a lot of studies on musical treatments, yet few are concerned about the effects of acoustic waves on mental fatigue. It is necessary to investigate the effects of auditory stimulation on mental fatigue. This study used a 24-hour-restraint mouse model with mental fatigue symptoms as animal subjects. The 24-hour-restraint mice were divided into a control group and two acoustic groups. Two auditory stimulation, i.e., pink noise with 5kHz pure tone and pink noise with 10kHz pure tone, were generated for each acoustic group. Each acoustic group was exposed to one stimulus at 60 dB(A) for 1h per day. After 7 days, we carried out the open field test and the forced swimming test. We found increased total distance and latency to abandon and decreased immobility time in the auditory stimulation groups compared to the control group. The pink noise with high-frequency tones may have positive effects on relieving mental fatigue behaviours. © 2022 IEEE."

The COVID-19 pandemic proved to be a global challenge and the worst crisis in the aviation industry's history. Pilots were exposed to particularly high psychological stressors due to new preventative measures, stringent quarantine experiences, loss of income and unemployment. Research question. The purpose of the study was to assess the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19 on pilot mental health and wellbeing-with specific reference to quarantine experiences. Method. Research was conducted over the period May-July 2020 and data was gathered via a snowball sampling as well as a voluntary response technique. A total of N=1324 pilots completed a bespoke online biodata survey, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results. The analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant relationship between quarantine context or quarantine duration and pilot mental health. However, a fairly high percentage of respondents reported moderate depression (10,9%) and moderately severe to severe depression (8,8%) when quarantine extended to 10 weeks and beyond. When considering anxiety, 28,3% of the respondents reported moderate symptoms and 12,5% reported severe symptoms of anxiety with extended quarantine. Discussion. The psychological impact of COVID-19 causes serious concerns from a risk management perspective. Screening processes to identify or mitigate risks associated with the psychological impact should be considered. Conclusion. The findings of the study may be useful to formulate interventions that can minimise psychological stressors and improve mental health and resilience as pilots return to normal operations. It can also serve as historical reference or baseline for evaluating prevention, control and treatment programmes in the coming years. © 2022 The Authors."

After years of varying levels of in-house training, the continuous growth of RPA operations indicates that qualification and training concepts for civil remote pilots are required. In this novel study undertaken as part of an interdisciplinary research project on civil RPA operations of the German Aerospace Center, remote pilot competences (RPCs) and training needs of professional, civil multicopter pilots in Germany were evaluated. Thirty-eight RPCs covering knowledge, flight skills, cognitive abilities, interpersonal skills, and personality aspects were assessed in an online questionnaire for professional multicopter pilots (N = 88). Based on participants' ratings regarding the criticality, difficulty, and frequency of the application of these competences, the RPCs were subsequently classified in terms of their relevance for different stages of training, specifically whether they should be integrated into initial training or additionally be included in recurrent refresher training. For initial training, the majority of key RPCs were found to be related to cognitive abilities and theory knowledge. In contrast, flight skills, personality aspects, and interpersonal skills were considered to be relevant for recurrent training. This study contributes empirical data to previous RPC training recommendations and also promotes the concept of customized recurrent training to ensure safe and effective flight performance. © 2022 The Authors."
"The Relationship between Civil Pilots' Resilience, Psychological Well-being and Work Performance","2022","Transportation Research Procedia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146155104&partnerID=40&md5=fd9d7c8ce4a609d2fdf7a515c2e1832e","Resilience refers to individual's extant thinking process and behavior of choice which may protect the individual from suffering of robust stress or tragic events and smoothly get back to his/her life tracks. Resilience, thus, may be regarded as coping skills that the individual being equipped with in work organizations to improve his/her work performances from an occupational psychology perspective. That is, resilience may be defined, in part, as developing a constellation of traits to do individual's job well. For employees in high-stress and-risk aviation industry, it is of specialty crucial to assess the relationship between their resilience (i.e., stress coping skills), psychological well-being, and work performance. As such, individualized resilience-boosting program may be developed per the thorough understanding of this relationship. In the present study, 191 civil pilots were invited to participate in our questionnaire-filling survey. Based on factor analysis methods, six top-ranking factors encompassing 1) inner strength resource, 2) inner positive energy, 3) inspired growth, 4) solution by help, 5) interpersonal resource, and 6) spiritual religion were obtained for constructing our resilience scale. A total of three factors, including 1) work engagement, 2) promotion, and 3) good-teams, were used for establishing our work performance scale. Likewise, five factors consisting of 1) positive emotions, 2) commitment, 3) good relationships, 4) life meaning, and 5) achievement were employed to serve as our psychological well-being scale. The reliability tests revealed by Cronbach's alpha for the resilience, the psychological well-being, and the work performance scales ranged from.93 to.73. Using the correlation analysis methods, participants' resilience scores were positively associated with their psychological well-being (r=.85, p<.001), and work performance (r=.71, p<.001) scores. Moreover, each factor (aspect) of the resilience was correlated with each factor (aspect) in the psychological well-being and work performance scale in a positive manner (all ps<.001). Furthermore, pilots' age seems to affect their two aspects, inner positive energy and spiritual religion, of resilience with paradoxical increments of these two factor scores in the eldest (age 60) group. Surprisingly, pilots with college degree had greater scores in inner positive energy and inspired growth of resilience as compared to pilots with advanced degree. Self-motivated ab initio group had greatest solution by help scores, while military ab initio group exhibited greatest spiritual religion scores in the three groups of ab initio training backgrounds. These results, taken together, prompt us to draw a tentative conclusion that our resilience scale may serve as a sensitive and reliable tool for not only providing civil aviators a convenient self-appraisal battery but concomitantly suggesting his/her mental health and well-being. © 2022 The Authors."

The study is designed to explore the pandemic-induced tourism crisis along with emotional, mental, and physical effects. An in-depth qualitative exploration was used and a tool comprising of data sets include representatives from aviation, resorts and hotel segments, tour operators, and travel agents. The researchers used a semi-structured questionnaire that had two sections and explored industry concerns, HR strategies, and employee distress through a multi-stage process involving coding and content analysis. The study analyzed the pandemic-induced crises at the micro and macro levels and grouped them under three essential dimensions such as; organizational and industry concerns, organizational HR policies, and employees’ psychological distress. The subthemes under these dimensions can contribute to scale validation. The subthemes grouped under the three major dimensions have come out as a theoretical model of how the pandemic has affected professionals at these three levels. The findings as items can be validated through descriptive research in quantitative terms forming the future scope. The study analyzed the perceptions of professionals in the tourism and hospitality business amid the pandemic and concludes that a proactive HR policy can minimize employees’ psychological distress. © 2022 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

The current study sought to conduct the first systematic literature review and meta-analysis aimed at determin-ing suicide risk across the diverse, high pressure and male-dominated transport industry (commercial aviation, merchant seafaring, transit/driving) as compared to the general/employed population. Methods Searches of PubMed/Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were conducted without date restric-tion until March 2021. Studies were included if they were written in English, were peer reviewed, and presented primary observational research data. Studies referring exclusively to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, self-harm, and/or accidents were excluded. Results Following deletion of duplicates and non-English titles, a total of 4201 titles/abstracts were screened and 92 full-texts were read against inclusion/exclusion criteria. The final included sample consisted of 23 articles (16 used for meta-analysis). Results from the meta-analysis indicated that transport workers had a significantly elevated risk for suicide as compared to the general/employed population. Results were consistent across sensi-tivity analyses, and there was some variation across subgroup analyses. Conclusions Overall, we found transport workers had a significantly higher risk for suicide than the general/ employed population, and this appeared to be driven by the association for those working in merchant seafaring/ maritime occupations. The findings are discussed in relation to an identified need for the development, imple-mentation, and evaluation of tailored workplace suicide prevention strategies for transport industry workers. © 2022, Nordic Association of Occupational Safety and Health.

Pilots had an amazing life, in addition to high reputation, very comfortable working hours, a lot of free time, long layovers at dreamlike holiday destinations and a high income. That changed quickly when aviation was liberalized and, alongside the luxurious, expensive flag or network carriers (NWC, e.g., British Airways, Qantas, Lufthansa), low-cost airlines (LCC) launched a revolutionary new business model with new management methods. LCC opened up new markets, offered cheap flight tickets and made aviation accessible not only to the rich, but also to ordinary people. By implementing a consistent business model like NWC or LCC, this business model will entail different working conditions that are clearly distinguishable and measurable (Alamdari & Fagan, 2005; Pate & Beaumont, 2006). Previous studies have compared LCCs and NWCs regarding management strategies (ITF, 2002; Jean & Lohmann, 2016; Lohmann & Koo, 2013), looked at their effects on flight operations (ITF, 2002), working and employment conditions, and safety culture (Brannigan et al., 2019; Reader et al., 2016). Jackson and Earl (2006) also compared fatigue levels and general health of short and long-haul pilots of LCCs and NWCs (Jackson & Earl, 2006). The present study was designed to compare actual rosters and working conditions of LCC and NWC pilots and, going further than previous studies, also compared their work-related and psychosocial stress, sleep restrictions, and other fatigue risks associated with flight duties, sleep problems, fatigue, and mental health issues (e.g., well-being, symptoms of depression, anxiety and common mental disorders (CMD)) of pilots flying for NWC or LCCs © 2022, International Journal of Aviation, Aeronautics, and Aerospace.All Rights Reserved."

For example, in the aviation sector, flight traffic went down drastically with no certainty of being recovered. This calls for a methodology to predict the flight traffic to provide strategic planning on flight schedules operational, route structuring, and flight navigation service cost determination. However, current developments mainly focus on flight traffic forecasting based on historical data without considering external factors. In this study, we propose the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique to forecast flight traffic in Indonesia involving external variables such as macroeconomic variables and Google Trends. LSTM is proposed because of its flexibility to model non-linear time series data and has a good reputation for predictive accuracy. We first select a few among Google Trends and macroeconomic variables using nonlinearity analysis and cross-correlation function (CCF). We then employ the selected variables to forecast the flight traffic and compare it to the one using only historical flight traffic data. Our results concluded, based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), that the model involving google trend outperforms the other three models, i.e., the model with only historical data, the model with macroeconomics, and the model with both macroeconomic and Google Trends. It is because, in this digital era, Google Trends can reflect population psychology in an up-to-date manner. © 2022 IEEE."

When studying at school, young people cannot always appreciate the usefulness of their knowledge, skills, qualities, and applicability in further studies and life. The article presents the results of the sociological survey on the influence of school and higher education institutions on the development of students’ personal qualities and skills. The empirical base was the results of a study conducted among 1–3-year students of four Moscow universities: Moscow Aviation Institute (NRU), Moscow State Pedagogical University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction Institute, and the State Academic University for the Humanities. Questionnaires and mini-interviews were used as research methods. The purpose of the study was to identify the specifics of the influence of school and university on the formation of students’ personal qualities and skills in the Moscow region. The survey showed that school had the most significant influence on forming the ability to communicate, perform routine work, and subject to the rules, and such qualities as discipline, stress resistance, adaptability, tolerance. While at university, students learn to take the initiative, set goals and realize them, defend their opinion and solve non-standard tasks, be independent and flexible. The survey participants would like the school to be more focused on developing students’ creative abilities and their own opinions; they lack practice and interaction in the classroom and an individual approach. Nevertheless, many qualities and skills developed at school helped them study at university. © 2022 Moscow Polytechnic University. All rights reserved."

These stressors may be general, affecting the entire laboratory or all cases, or specific, affecting individual examiners or single cases. Stressors affecting individual examiners include: vicarious trauma associated with details of worked cases, nonstandard working hours, fatigue, the monotony of repetitious tasks, fear of errors, and severe backlogs. Policies and laboratory cultures can be put in place to minimize the effects of stressors; however, current forensic organizational responses to these stressors may vary from punitive to collaborative approaches. This article presents several models and case studies that can help inform the creation of positive laboratory policies. A system of discipline-wide centralized error reporting, similar to systems used to reduce fatal mistakes in medicine and aviation, could have the potential to identify areas of concern within forensic science practices. © 2021"

Training troubleshooting professionals is thus a concern for various occupational sectors—particularly the military, aviation, power plant, and in industrial processes—and large investments have been made to create and use simulators that train troubleshooting skills. In the design and evaluation of simulators for troubleshooting, this review shows that no single level of simulation realism—or fidelity—works best in training, and that the effect of fidelity depends on trainees’ prior skill level and the type of troubleshooting system (electronic or mechanical). © 2022 “IISE”."

However, the analysis of unsafe behavior from the perspective of individual psychology is relatively low. In order to promote the safety of civil aviation and to reduce unsafe behaviors such as errors and violations caused by civil aviation personnel, the current study concluded the psychological factors associated with the unsafe behavior of civil aviation practitioners. The study was based on the core principles of safety psychology and the human factors analysis and classification system (HFACS). The psychological factors influencing the unsafe behaviors of civil aviation employees included risk perception, safe attention, memory, negative emotions, job burnout, self-control, safety attitude, safety motivation, and personality traits. Combined with the social cognition theoretical framework and the psychological factors associated with the unsafe behavior of civil aviation personnel, a model was formed. The model provides theoretical and practical reference during the analysis of psychological factors such as errors and violations caused by civil aviation personnel. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Together with Nikolay Zhukovsky, Igor Sikorsky, Stephen Timoshenko, Alexander Fan-der-Flit, and Alexey Lebedev, he was one of the organizers of the Air Fleet of the Russian Empire. He is the author of various inventions: gyroscopic sight and other types of aviation equipment. We analyze works by G. Bothezat on the impulse theory of propellers. In particular, the scientist derived formulas for ensuring the flight stability of airplanes and helicopters. He developed training ballistic tables, which allowed making corrections for the speed of the flight and the direction of the wind. We briefly described a biography of G. Bothezat, focusing on the student period of his life in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and the reasons for G. Bothezat’s departure to the United States in 1918. It is stated that it was there that his talent as a designer and creator of helicopters of the original system was disclosed in the best way. In 1922, George Bothezat obtained the financial support of the American government to build a workable helicopter model without prototypes and experiments, only based on the results of calculations. The reasons why G. Bothezat did not manage to achieve the launch of the serial production of helicopters are analyzed. We also mention the activities of the company founded by G. Bothezat, which was engaged in the production of fans of a new type for the US Navy. The Bothezat system fans were installed at the Rockefeller Center in New York as well as in American tanks. It is emphasized that I. Sikorsky also used the works of G. Bothezat in his research. It is stated that the flight trajectory calculated by G. Bothezat in air and airless space was used in the development of the American program of a manned landing on the Moon using the “Apollo” system. © 2022 Editorial Office China Surfactant Detergent and Cosmetics.

Air traffic control operators routinely work in such complex environments, and we designed tracking and collision prediction tasks to emulate their elementary tasks. The physiological response to the workload variations in these tasks was elucidated to untangle the impact of workload variations experienced by operators. Electroencephalogram (EEG), eye activity, and heart rate variability (HRV) data were recorded from 24 participants performing tracking and collision prediction tasks with three levels of difficulty. Our findings indicate that variations in task load in both these tasks are sensitively reflected in EEG, eye activity and HRV data. Multiple regression results also show that operators' performance in both tasks can be predicted using the corresponding EEG, eye activity and HRV data. The results also demonstrate that the brain dynamics during each of these tasks can be estimated from the corresponding eye activity, HRV and performance data. Furthermore, the markedly distinct neurometrics of workload variations in the tracking and collision prediction tasks indicate that neurometrics can provide insights on the type of mental workload. These findings have applicability to the design of future mental workload adaptive systems that integrate neurometrics in deciding not just 'when' but also 'what' to adapt. Our study provides compelling evidence in the viability of developing intelligent closed-loop mental workload adaptive systems that ensure efficiency and safety in complex work environments. © 2001-2011 IEEE."

Whether these are solely related to their work schedules/jetlag or are in part related to individual factors is unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantlydisrupted the aviation industry and many cabin crew have been grounded. This provides a unique opportunity to assessthe causes of fatigue and sleepiness in this population.METHODS: An online anonymous survey was distributed in April–June 2020 to cabin crew who were 1) flying, 2) grounded butdoing alternative work, and 3) grounded, not working, or unemployed. The survey measured fatigue, sleepiness, andmental health. It also screened their risk for insomnia, depression, and shift work disorder and assessed drug andcaffeine use.RESULTS: Collected were 409 valid responses: 45 currently flying; 35 grounded but doing alternate work; and 329 not working. Onaverage, all three groups experienced normal levels of fatigue and sleepiness. The risk for major depressive disorder was27.4%, with 59.5% of individuals reporting abnormal levels of anxiety. Caffeine intake and the use of drugs and alcoholto facilitate sleep were common, although not different between those currently flying vs. grounded.CONCLUSIONS: With reduced workloads or not flying, cabin crew reported lowered fatigue and sleepiness compared to prepandemicfindings, along with reduced risk for major depressive disorder. However, a high occurrence of negative emotionalstates were reported, potentially related to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.

Pilots are commonly exposed to some sources of emotional and cognitive stressors, especially for flight cadets, which have an important influence on flight safety. The present study aimed to study the relationship between emotional trait factors, emotional state, mental workload and simulated flight performance (SFP) under an acute psychological stress situation. Methods. Fifty-five undergraduates were included in the study. The Wong and Law emotional intelligence scale (WLEIS), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), stress rating questionnaire (SRQ) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) were used as data collection tools. Nine hours of simulated flight training were conducted in a simulator of the Type-6 Primary Trainer (Aviation University Air Force, China). The simulated flight assessment was taken as the acute psychological stressor. Results. SFP was negatively correlated with tensity and state anxiety. Emotional intelligence (EI) indirectly affected the SFP mediated by emotional state and workload, and emotional state had a mediating effect on the relationship between trait anxiety and SFP. Conclusions. The findings indicated that emotional trait factors (EI and trait anxiety) may indirectly affect SFP under an acute psychological stress situation, and emotional state (tensity and state anxiety) and mental workload played an important mediating role. © 2021 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB)."

"Altered Attention Network in Paratroopers Exposed to Repetitive Subconcussion: Evidence Based on Behavioral and Event-Related Potential Results","2021","Journal of Neurotrauma","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120863558&partnerID=40&md5=5f0ba61cc1379963c24cf737c46b33f5","Cognitive impairment caused by repetitive subconcussion has received increasing attention in recent years. Although the dysfunction of attention has been confirmed by neuropsychological research using scales, there is no event-related potentials (ERPs) research. The Attention Network Test (ANT) has been widely used to evaluate the three separate components of attention processing (alerting, orienting, and executive control). Twenty-seven paratroopers exposed to repetitive subconcussion (subconcussion group) and 25 matched healthy control participants (HCs group) were enrolled, and all of them performed the ANT test while continuous scalp electroencephalography data were recorded. On the behavioral performance level, the subconcussion group showed a slower task response, with an especially significant slower reaction time in alerting. Concerning ERP results, reduction amplitudes of cue-N1 in the alerting network were observed, indicating that this group was less able to make efficient use of cues and maintain an alerting state for incoming information. For the orienting network, no difference in N1 amplitude was observed between the two groups. Moreover, there was a reduced P3 amplitude in the executive control network in the subconcussion group compared with the HCs group, suggesting a dysfunction of attentional resource allocation and inhibition control in the former group. This study is, to our knowledge, the first analysis of the altered attention network caused by repetitive subconcussion from the perspectives of behavioral and neuropsychology levels. These preliminary results revealed the possible damage of the alerting and executive control networks and provided a reference for further research on subconcussion cognitive impairment. © 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."

The current system of healthcare provision permits on-call surgeons to work in sleep deprived states when performing procedures. Fatigue has been demonstrated to negatively affect performance. This study aimed to explore measurements of sleep deprivation and their impact on simulated performance. Methods: This was a single site study conducted between September 2019 and February 2020. Surgical trainee and consultants were conveniently sampled from a single site. All testing was done between 7 AM and 9 AM. Participants completed electroencephalogram testing using a modified Multiple Sleep Latency Test testing for objective sleep measurement, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale for subjective sleep measurement. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task and the SIMENDO simulated tasks were used for standardized performance assessment. Results: Surgeons entered sleep in 6 min, on average pre-call. This significantly decreased to an average of 164 s post-call (P = 0.016). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scoring was 5, indicating poor baseline sleep quality. There was higher self-reported fatigue and sleepiness in post-call states. Performance decrements were noted in cognitive performance reaction time and aspects of technical instrument proficiency. Conclusions: Surgeons are objectively sleep deprived pre-call according to internationally recognized guidelines. This sleep deprivation increases significantly in post-call states. Tasks with higher cognitive demands showed greater levels of diminished performance compared to those with lower cognitive demands. Current models of provision of surgical on-call are not conducive to optimizing sleep in surgeons. Prioritization of workload in post-call states, focusing on preserving individuals cognitive resources and utilizing lower cognitively demanding aspects of work is likely to have positive impacts on performance outcomes. © 2021"
"Predictors of the feeling of stress in the aviation sector","2021","Medycyna Pracy","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122111851&partnerID=40&md5=06b98dac5196038b013717a81e7baec7","BACKGROUND: Employees in the aviation sector constitute an especially interesting professional group due to a lack of empirical data on their psychological functioning, and the fact that this industry is currently experiencing a phase of dynamic development. However, taking into consideration the automation and specific qualities of the sector, human resources should be given much more attention as they are constantly challenged and face diverse difficulties at work while cooperating in various organic and non-organic teams. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 326 employees of Pyrzowice (Poland), Szymany (Poland), and Košice (Slovakia) airports (however, people employed at the Polish airports were predominant, N = 250). The average age of the participants was 39.3 years, and the sample was predominantly male (N = 278, 85.3%). During the research procedure, the following questionnaires were used: the Feeling of Threat in the Workplace Questionnaire, the Feeling of Stress Questionnaire, the 10-Item Personality Inventory, and the Mini-COPE Stress Inventory. RESULTS: The regression analysis indicated that personality variables did not allow for predicting the level of stress. However, the helplessness-oriented style (β = 0.191, p = 0.004), avoidant behaviors (β = 0.244, p < 0.001), and the feeling of threat (β = 0.147, p = 0.009) were significant predictors of the feeling of stress, and their high level corresponded with a higher level of stress. The final model explained 23% of the total variance in the feeling of stress. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, practical recommendations should concern developing employees' skills related to monitoring stressors and strengthening proactivity in difficult or threatening situations. Such proactive strategies may decrease the tendency to use avoidant and helplessness-oriented behaviors that may cause a higher level of stress perceived by employees. Also, the authors recommend providing training and support using some cognitive behavioral techniques because it seems that the regular application of those methods supports the development of agency and control while facing challenging situations.

"Reliability and validity of a 3-min psychomotor vigilance task in assessing sensitivity to sleep loss and alcohol: Fitness for duty in aviation and transportation","2021","Sleep","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116845928&partnerID=40&md5=e05d2eaadff922727081b36d69f1c1b8","Study Objectives: The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) is a widely used objective method to measure sustained attention, but the standard 10-min version is often impractical in operational settings. We investigated the reliability and validity of a 3-min PVT administered on a portable handheld device assessing sensitivity to sleep loss and alcohol in relation to a 10-min PVT and to applied tasks. Methods: A total of 47 healthy volunteers underwent a 12 consecutive days sleep lab protocol. A cross-over design was adopted including total sleep deprivation (38 h awake), sleep restriction (SR, 4 h sleep opportunity), acute alcohol consumption, and SR after alcohol intake (SR/Alc 4 h sleep opportunity). Participants performed a 10-min and 3-min PVT and operationally relevant tasks related to demands in aviation and transportation. Results: Sleep loss resulted in significant performance impairments compared with baseline measurements detected by both PVT versions - particularly for mean speed (both p < 0.001) - and the operationally relevant tasks. Similar effects were observed due to alcohol intake (speed: both p < 0.001). The 3-min and 10-min PVT results were highly correlated (speed: between r = 0.72 and r = 0.89). Three of four aviation-related tasks showed robust correlations with the 3-min PVT. Correlations with the parameters of the task related to transportation were lower, but mainly significant. Conclusion: The 3-min PVT showed a high reliability and validity in assessing sleep loss and alcohol-induced impairments in cognitive performance. Thus, our results underline its usefulness as potential fitness for duty self-monitoring tool in applied settings. © 2021 Sleep Research Society 2021.

"Crew Resource Management Training for Surgical Teams, A Fragmented Landscape","2021","Journal of Surgical Education","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108000425&partnerID=40&md5=2724a27aa1633faeec4da90183a8fa19","Objective: Medical Crew Resource Management (CRM) training courses are designed to increase patient safety by reducing the effects of human errors. These training courses are most popular in surgery and a wide range of medical CRM training courses for surgical teams is now available. However, the effects of these CRM training courses on patient outcomes are inconclusive. Although surgical teams feel the need to be trained in team collaboration skills, they are often puzzled about what criteria to apply when choosing a medical CRM training course. This study aimed to compare CRM training courses on didactic components and simulation-exercises to explore if these courses are interchangeable. Methods: In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted among 10 main CRM training providers of surgical teams in the Netherlands. Results: Although a large variety was found in the content of CRM training courses, the most substantial differences were found in the simulation-exercises. Nine out of 10 trainers stated that standard simulation-exercises would be a step forward to ensure quality in CRM trainings. According to the trainers, the implementation of medical CRM can reduce human errors and as a result, preventable patient complications. They suggested a quality standard for CRM trainers in the medical field to ensure the quality of medical team training as a way to reach this. Conclusions: Medical CRM training courses are diverse and noninterchangeable. Trainers expect that if CRM becomes part of surgical training and is embedded in operating theatre culture, it could be of great value for patients and professionals. © 2021 The Authors"

Hollander (1927-2020). Hollander was a major figure in the study of group and organizational leadership. He received his BS from Case Western Reserve University in 1948, his MS in psychometrics, working with Robert Thorndike in 1950, and his PhD in social psychology from Columbia University in 1952. After serving as a naval aviation psychologist during the Korean War, Ed began his academic career at Carnegie Mellon, initiating work on leadership that led to a 20-year research program at the State University of New York at Buffalo where he was also founding director of the doctoral program in social/organizational psychology and provost of social sciences. In 1989, he became the City University of New York Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Baruch College until his retirement in 1999. During his career, he had many visiting appointments, including the Tavistock Institute, Harvard, Oxford, the National Academy of Sciences, and Istanbul University. Hollander also served as president of the Eastern Psychological Association and American Psychological Association (APA) Division 1, APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP), and on the Governing Council of the International Society of Political Psychology. He received a distinguished career award from the International Association of Applied Psychology, the International Leadership Association, the Network of Leadership Scholars, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Center for Creative Leadership. His landmark books, including Leaders, Groups, and Influence (1964) and Leadership Dynamics (1978), positioned leadership as an influence process occurring at the nexus of leader, followers, and organizational context. Ed emphasized the importance of an engaged followership to the study of leadership, rather than focusing primarily on the leader. He is perhaps best known for the idiosyncrasy credit model, a framework that details how follower perceptions affect leader behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."
"Analysis of web-based travel health advice provided to international travellers with chronic medical and psychiatric illnesses","2021","International Journal of Medical Informatics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114792996&partnerID=40&md5=3ec6065c01a2e1f30190eee93a5d4575","Objectives: The internet is an important source of travel health information. Individuals living with chronic illnesses consult patient organisation websites for illness-related information. We analysed the scope of online travel health information available to patients with pre-existing medical conditions. Study Design: A descriptive content analysis of patient organisation websites was conducted. Methods: The Google® search engine was interrogated using search terms related to the principal chronic diseases from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Data relating to 41 travel health variables were extracted from each eligible website. An aggregate quality score was derived for each organisation based on the presence of specific website information. Visitor usage and search analytics for each organisation's website were also described. Results: We examined 145 official organisation websites relating to 10 major chronic illnesses. The largest number of websites was retrieved for patients with cancer (n = 36). Only 21 (16.5%) websites provided information on fitness-to-travel considerations. COPD websites had the highest average quality score (17.68%), followed by diabetes (14.91%) and dementia (13.28%). Mental health illness websites had the lowest score of 1.33%. There was a trend towards increased emphasis on pre-travel preparation and medications. Insect bite avoidance, malaria, animal bites, jet lag, and repatriation were addressed to the least extent. Conclusions: Our analysis exposes significant deficits in the coverage of travel health topics. Patient organisations should provide accessible pre-travel health advice to website users. Future research should elucidate the influence of web-based pre-travel health information on the behaviour of travellers with chronic disease. © 2021 The Author(s)"
"Changing the means of managerial work: effects of automated decision support systems on personnel selection tasks","2021","Journal of Business and Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091076852&partnerID=40&md5=7ce13eeb83f08379dc28ba8f64b85733","To enhance the quality and efficiency of information processing and decision-making, automation based on artificial intelligence and machine learning has increasingly been used to support managerial tasks and duties. In contrast to classical applications of automation (e.g., within production or aviation), little is known about how the implementation of automation for management changes managerial work. In a work design frame, this study investigates how different versions of automated decision support systems for personnel selection as a specific management task affect decision task performance, time to reach a decision, reactions to the task (e.g., enjoyment), and self-efficacy in personnel selection. In a laboratory experiment, participants (N = 122) were randomly assigned to three groups and performed five rounds of a personnel selection task. The first group received a ranking of the applicants by an automated support system before participants processed applicant information (support-before-processing group), the second group received a ranking after they processed applicant information (support-after-processing group), and the third group received no ranking (no-support group). Results showed that satisfaction with the decision was higher for the support-after-processing group. Furthermore, participants in this group showed a steeper increase in self-efficacy in personnel selection compared to the other groups. This study combines human factors, management, and industrial/organizational psychology literature and goes beyond discussions concerning effectiveness and efficiency in the emerging area of automation in management in an attempt to stimulate research on potential effects of automation on managers’ job satisfaction and well-being at work. © 2020, The Author(s)."

It was captured by the Zhitomir newspaper “Zhizn Volyn” in the late summer of 1915, when a crowd gathered in the city center mistakenly mistook the moonlight of the cross on the church for an enemy military airplane, anxiously awaiting an aerial bombardment. After analyzing the historical conditions under which this social phenomenon arose, the authors came to the conclusion that it was a consequence of the collective idea of war existing in the rear city, which has a predominantly irrational, imaginary character, formed mainly through rumors and biased periodicals. This is confirmed by newspaper and archival materials, which in the first year of the war did not record a single case of an air attack on the Volyn provincial center, as well as statistics on the use of military aviation of that period, which virtually completely excludes the possibility of an aerial bombardment of the city in the last days of August 1915. Authors in detail examined this event in Zhytomyr in a socio-psychological context, finding out the nature of the social fear inherent in that time, which caused a panic reaction of the crowd to an imaginary air threat, the mechanisms of its spread in crowds of people, the peculiarities of the imaginative perception of the crowd and the behavior of its participants. © 2021 International Network Center for Fundamental and Applied Research.

During the pandemic, people have been forced to experience new ways of interacting, working, learning, shopping, traveling, and eating meals. A critical question going forward is how these experiences have actually changed preferences and habits in ways that might persist after the pandemic ends. Many observers have suggested theories about what the future will bring, but concrete evidence has been lacking. We present evidence on how much US adults expect their own postpandemic choices to differ from their prepandemic lifestyles in the areas of telecommuting, restaurant patronage, air travel, online shopping, transit use, car commuting, uptake of walking and biking, and home location. The analysis is based on a nationally representative survey dataset collected between July and October 2020. Key findings include that the “new normal” will feature a doubling of telecommuting, reduced air travel, and improved quality of life for some. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

"Evaluating differences in cognitive functions and personality traits among air traffic controllers with and without error history","2021","Safety Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102136312&partnerID=40&md5=e2c4d5edbd0833ac74e7f1d7f8dc0c9e","Given the growing rate of air transportation, it is necessary to consider the safety of the aviation industry. Air traffic control is one of the most sensitive and important jobs in the field of flight safety. Working in such a context requires the use of high levels of cognitive functions, which can be impaired or reduced in speed and accuracy under pressure and stress. Another issue is that cognitive functions interact with non-cognitive factors, one of which is personality traits. Through using a causal-comparative method, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive functions like situational awareness, short-term memory, sustained attention and planning ability, and personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and adventurousness, on air traffic controllers’ human error by controlling the effect of age. For this purpose, five tests were selected from the Vienna Test System, namely MR, CORSI, DAUF, TOL-F, and EPP6, to measure controllers’ cognitive functions and personality traits. By convenience sampling, 37 controllers from the air control center participated in the tests. Excluding outliers, the groups were as follows: 16 controllers with error history and 15 controllers without error history. To control the effect of age on cognitive functions and personality traits, the groups’ data were compared using the covariance analysis. According to the results, there is a difference between groups in situational awareness (sig = 0.008, P ≤ 0.05) and sustained attention (sig = 0.01, P ≤ 0.05), with error-free controllers showing higher scores in these functions. However, in other cognitive functions that were studied, namely short-term memory (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05) and planning ability (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05), no difference was shown between the two groups. Moreover, the study of personality traits showed that controllers with errors differ from controllers without errors (sig = 0.02, P ≤ 0.05), but in emotionality (sig = 0.7, P ≤ 0.05) and adventurousness (sig = 0.6, P ≤ 0.05) there are no differences between the two groups. With these results in mind, efforts can be made to minimize potential errors in sensitive occupations such as air traffic control by using cognitive and personality screening tools. © 2021"
"Conscientiousness in pilots correlates with electrodermal stability: Study on simulated flights under social stress","2021","Safety","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110161362&partnerID=40&md5=f6e30ae6a2f9fbcfdd5f0cf949227cc2","For pilots, the capacity to cope with anxiety is crucial during a flight since they may be confronted with stressful situations. According to the Big Five Inventory, this capacity can be modulated by two important personality traits: Conscientiousness and neuroticism. The former would be related to concentration skills and the latter to the attention bias towards anxiety-provoking stimuli. Given the current development of monitoring systems for detecting the users’ state, which can be incorporated into cockpits, it is desirable to estimate their robustness to inter-individual personality differences. Indeed, several emotion recognition methods are based on physiological responses that can be modulated by specific personality profiles. The personality traits of twenty pilots were assessed. Afterwards, they performed two consecutive simulated flights without and with induced social stress while electrodermal activity was measured. Their subjective anxiety was assessed before the second flight, prior to the stress-induced condition. The results showed that higher scores in neuroticism correlated positively with cognitive and somatic anxiety. Moreover, under social stress, higher scores in conscientiousness correlated positively with electrodermal stability, i.e., a lower number of skin conductance responses. These results on both self-reported and physiological responses are in favor of the integration of personality differences into pilots’ state monitoring. © 2021 by the authors."

This article aims to discuss conceptual and practical features of SBE in psychiatry that may support or limit its development, so as to encourage clinicians and educators to consider the implementation of SBE in their practice. SBE took off with the aviation industry and has been steadily adopted in clinical education, alongside role play and patient educators, across many medical specialities. Concurrently, healthcare has shifted towards patient-centred approaches and clinical education has recognised the importance of reflective learning and teaching centred on learners' experiences. SBE is particularly well-suited to promoting a holistic approach to care, reflective learning, emotional awareness in interactions and learning, cognitive reframing, and co-construction of knowledge. These features present an opportunity to enhance education throughout the healthcare workforce, and align particularly well to psychiatric education, where interpersonal and relational dimensions are at the core of clinical skills. Additionally, SBE provides a strategic opportunity for people with lived experience of mental disorders to be directly involved in clinical education. However, tenacious controversies have questioned the adequacy of SBE in the psychiatric field, possibly limiting its adoption. The ability of simulated patients (SPs) to portray complex and contradictory cognitive, psychological and emotional states has been questioned. The validity of SBE to develop a genuine empathetic understanding of patients, to facilitate a comprehensive multiaxial diagnostic formulation, or to develop flexible interpersonal skills has been criticised. Finally, SBE's relevance to developing complex psychotherapeutic skills is much debated, while issues such as symptom induction in SPs or patients involvement raise ethical dilemmas. These controversies can be addressed through adequate evidence, robust learning design, and high standards of practice. Well-designed simulated scenarios can promote a positive consideration of mental disorders and complex clinical skills. Shared guidelines and scenario libraries for simulation can be developed, with expert psychiatrists, patients and students involvement, to offer SPs and educators a solid foundation to develop training. Beyond scenario design, the nuances and complexities in mental healthcare are also duly acknowledged during the debriefing phases, providing a crucial opportunity to reflect on complex interpersonal skills or the role of emotions in clinicians' behaviour. Considered recruitment and support of SPs by clinical educators can help to maintain psychological safety and manage ethical issues. The holistic and reflexive nature of SBE aligns to the rich humanistic tradition nurtured within psychiatry and medicine, presenting the opportunity to expand the use of SBE to support a range of clinical skills and workforce competencies required in psychiatry. © Copyright © 2021 Piot, Attoe, Billon, Cross, Rethans and Falissard."

The study of the problem of students' involvement in physical education is important in the research environment of universities. Modern students, studying for 8 hours a day at the university, are also forced to do homework, carry out scientific work, and it is physical culture and sports that are one of the most important factors for maintaining and promoting health. The purpose of this study is to identify the interest of students of the research university in physical education classes in the aspect of sociological analysis. Materials and methods. Students from the 1st to the 4th year of full-time study (150 people) of the Stupino branch of the Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) took part in an anonymous sociological survey by filling out Google forms. Results. The analysis of the results of the survey of students showed that the level of involvement in physical education is not fully formed (only 48,7% regularly attend physical education classes, 40,7% attend from time to time and almost 10,6% do not attend at all). Students do not have enough internal attitudes to realize the importance of physical culture classes. Nevertheless, 73,3% show interest in physical education, noting that they do it to improve general physical qualities. Conclusion. Physical education at the university is carried out throughout the entire period of study and is implemented in various forms that are interrelated, complement each other and represent a single process of physical education of students. The purpose of physical education at the university is the formation of physical culture of students as a systemic quality of personality, an integral component of the general culture of future specialists who are able to implement it in educational, social and professional activities and the family. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

Twenty-four to 130 in-flight medical emergencies are estimated to occur per 1 million passengers; however, there is no internationally agreed-upon recording or classification system. Up to 70% of in-flight emergencies are managed by the cabin crew without additional assistance. If a health care volunteer is requested, medical professionals should consider if they are in an appropriate condition to render aid, and then identify themselves to cabin crew, perform a history and physical examination, and inform the cabin crew of clinical impressions and recommendations. An aircraft in flight is a physically constrained and resource-limited environment. When needed, an emergency medical kit and automated external defibrillator are available on all U.S. aircraft with at least one flight attendant and a capacity for 30 or more passengers. Coordinated communication with the pilot, any available ground-based medical resources, and flight dispatch is needed if aircraft diversion is recommended. In the United States, medical volunteers are generally protected by the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998. There is no equivalent law governing international travel, and legal jurisdiction depends on the patient's and medical professional's countries of citizenship and the country in which the aircraft is registered."
"The importance of safety and security measures at sharm el sheikh airport and their impact on travel decisions after restarting aviation during the covid-19 outbreak","2021","Sustainability (Switzerland)","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105926170&partnerID=40&md5=b4dfc53258343aa82e04eb36c165620b","Travel decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic might be substantially influenced by destination-based attributes, in particular, health safety measures at airports. In the current study, we aimed to assess the effects of the perceived importance of safety measures at the Sharm El Sheikh airport on the intention of international passengers to revisit the destination, which might reflect their behavioral control for traveling to other tourism destinations. A total of 954 international travelers were asked to fill out a survey to reveal their travel risk perceptions, the importance of airport safety measures, and their future intentions to revisit the destination, and the data were integrated in an SEM model. The results showed that passengers with low-risk perceptions and highly perceived importance of logistic and sanitization procedures, as well as traveler-and staff-related safety measures, were more likely to exhibit greater intentions to revisit the city and lower intentions to cancel or change future travel plans to other touristic regions. Health safety at airports should be stressed in future strategic plans by governmental authorities and stakeholder activities to mitigate the psychological barriers of tourists. © 2021 by the authors.

Studies of physicians, including medical students, residents, and fellows, have shown that they also experience mental disorders, with some research (e.g., on depression) showing prevalence rates higher than those in the general population. Tragically, physicians also have higher suicide rates than the general population. In this commentary, the author discusses his own challenges with mental disorders beginning in early childhood. He shares how earlier trauma led to the emergence of symptoms that nearly caused him to withdraw from medical school during his first year, and he describes how support from a faculty member helped him receive psychiatric treatment that allowed him to successfully negotiate that serious crisis and experience a long, productive career. The author underscores how the idealized image of the physician as care giver rather than care receiver that many bring to their medical career, as well as the stigma associated with mental disorders, may prevent physicians from seeking care. He uses the narrative of his personal journey to make a plea to colleagues to share their own stories of mental illness and successful treatment, arguing that this is key to ultimately destigmatizing these issues for the profession of medicine. © 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges"

If airlines are to resume flying at commercially sustainable levels, they must work to restore passengers confidence and sense of security. This study examined commercial airline passengers’ health concerns and attitudes towards infection prevention and control measures for travel health and safety in the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted inviting adult members of 39 frequent flyer groups across three social media platforms to participate in an online survey. Results: A total of 205 respondents completed the survey. The majority (75.6%) reported feeling ‘somewhat’ to ‘extremely concerned’ about contracting an infectious disease while flying, particularly respiratory-related. Few (9.8%) reported perceiving their health as an ‘essential priority’ for their preferred airline. Most respondents agreed airlines should provide complimentary hand sanitisers (86.8%), sanitary wipes (82.9%) and masks (64.4%) for passengers to use while flying as well as more information about preventing the spread of infections (90.7%), which would make the majority feel safer to fly. Conclusion: COVID-19 has extensively challenged the air travel industry. Passengers have signalled that they expect more from airlines, and that they would actively engage in additional infection prevention and disease control measures while flying. Airlines must ensure passengers about the steps taken to minimize travel-associated risks, and their commitment towards passengers' health and wellbeing, in order to rebuild consumers’ confidence in the recovery of the air travel industry. © 2020 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control"

Furthermore, we verified (4) the moderating effect of cabin crew’s previous overseas experience on the relationship between cross-cultural adjustment competency and turnover intention. MBTI-Form M test and a survey questionnaire were distributed to 185 Korean cabin crew members in Middle Eastern airlines, and 172 valid datapoints were used for analysis. It was revealed that the cabin crew members showed significantly different levels of cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, and coping competency depending on their personality traits. Further-more, those with higher cross-cultural adjustment competency and stress coping are more likely to have positive mental health, which also had an influence on lowering their turnover intention. Occupational competency had no significant association with mental health; however, it directly affects turnover intention. The findings will contribute not only to career plan guidelines for cabin crew aspirants, but also to airlines’ recruitment strategies as well as human resources management in aviation industry. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of the present study was to examine the fatiguing effect of continuous noise, noise that is present in the cabin of a truck, or an aircraft during flight. In pursuit of this aim, a monotonous driving scenario that has previously been shown to induce fatigue was employed, along with broadband noise set at 75dBA. Changes in participants brain wave activity as measured using an Electroencephalography (EEG), along with subjective measures and driving performance were analysed. Forty-five drivers were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (ambient noise group at 40 dBA and broadband noise groups at 55 dBA and 75 dBA) and asked to complete a 90 min monotonous drive. Alpha brain wave activity, subjective fatigue response and deteriorating driving performance all indicate the monotonous drive to be fatiguing. Noise effects were evident with theta brain wave activity where the two noise groups (55 dBA and 75 dBA) had higher levels of theta activity than the ambient noise group. However, no interactions for time by noise were evident in any of the recorded brain activity frequency bands, although trends were evident with alpha activity.

The network rigidity index (NRI), and the steps to break the relational complexity network following a central-available-node-first rule, was hypothesized to explain the overall task demand, whereas marginal-effort-decrease rule was expected to explain the actual operational outcome. Background: Understanding the conflict resolution process of ATCos is important for aviation safety and efficiency. However, linear models are insufficient. We proposed a new model that ATCos behavior can be largely considered as a process to break the relational complexity network, in which nodes represent the aircraft while links represent the cognitive complexity to understand the aircraft dyad relationship. Method: Twenty-one professional ATCos completed 27 conflict resolution scenarios that varied in the NRI and other control variables. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to understand the influence of the NRI on the number of interventions, mental workload, and unresolved rate. A cross-validation was performed to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Results: NRI influenced ATCos intervention number in a curvilinear manner, which further leads to ATCo’s mental workload. The deviance between the number of interventions and the NRI was strongly linked with unresolved rate. Cross-validation suggests that the models predictions are robust. Conclusion: The network disentangling model provides a useful theory-driven way to explain controllers’ conflict resolution workload and other important performance outcomes such as intervention probability. Application: The proposed model can potentially be used for workload management, sector design, and intelligent decision support tool development. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

While some actions of the individual that lead to poor care will be due to a lack of knowledge or training, others are to do with personality or attitudes, leading to poor interactions with patients or other staff, poor leadership skills, or to a greater likelihood of providing care which is less safe or of lower quality. In terms of ability to change, the authors later showed that crew resource management training changed these attitudes appropriately for most pilots. However, the attitudes of one group actually became less appropriate over the course. From a patient’s point of view, having a doctor who is a perfectionist sounds like good news.

"Perceived reliability of medical device alarms-a major determinant of medical errors driven by frozen medical thinking","2021","International Journal for Quality in Health Care","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126072807&partnerID=40&md5=316b4fd991f85693398bbbe766193151","This concept paper introduces the phenomenon of self-Assigning a 'perceived reliability' value to medical device readings as a potential source of cognitive bias in medical decision-making. Medical errors can result from clinical decisions based on partial clinical data despite medical device readings providing data to the contrary. At times, this results from clinician distrust of medical device output. Consequentially, clinicians engage in a form of 'frozen thinking', a fixation on a particular thought process despite data to the contrary. Many medical devices, such as intensive care unit (ICU) monitors and alarms, lack validated statistics of device output reliability and validity. In its absence, clinicians assign a self-perceived reliability value to device output data and base clinical decisions therefrom. When the perceived reliability value is low, clinicians distrust the device and ignore device readings, especially when other clinical data are contrary. We explore the cognitive and theoretical underpinnings of this 'perceived reliability' phenomenon. The mental assignment of a perceived reliability value stems from principles of 'script theory' of medical decision-making. In this conceptual framework, clinicians make decisions by comparing current situations to mental 'scripts' of prior clinical decisions and their outcomes. As such, the clinician utilizes scripts of prior experiences to create the perceived reliability value. Self-Assigned perceived reliability is subject to multiple dangers of reliability and cognitive biases. Some of these biases are presented. Among these is the danger of dismissing device readings as 'noise'. This is particularly true of ICU alarms that can emit frequent false alarms and contribute to clinician sensory overload. The cognitive dangers of this 'noise dismissal' are elaborated via its similarity to the phenomenon of 'spatial disorientation' among aviation pilots. We conclude with suggestions for reducing the potential bias of 'perceived reliability'. First presented are regulatory/legislative and industry-based interventions for increasing the study of, and end-user access to, validated device output reliability statistics. Subsequently, we propose strategies for overcoming and preventing this phenomenon. We close with suggestions for future research and development of this 'perceived reliability' phenomenon. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Relevant data and information are provided by health, industry and information technology, transportation, customs, immigration management, civil aviation, railway, etc. The purpose is to analyze various information visualization cases for public health emergencies and how to convey information to the public. We analyze how to deal with the three user elements of user participation subject, user cognitive psychology and user interaction behavior in the excellent information visualization design cases. Combined with the above analysis, the development of the epidemic situation can be presented in a rich and intuitive way, so that the public can understand the transmission route of the epidemic and the number of cases, and the public will have less panic about it. At the same time, the correlation between data should be mined to help the audience to establish an effective logical thinking in the face of massive information. Moreover, attention should also be paid to the different ways of information visualization to bring different psychological feelings to the viewers.

Ample evidence indicates incentives to underperform on cognitive testing can negatively affect cognitive recovery, but there is little to no research on how incentives to perform well may affect recovery. This gap in research should be considered to obtain a full picture of cognitive recovery following mTBI. METHOD: Aeromedical Evaluations present a unique opportunity to study cognitive and functional recovery after mTBI. Three case studies are presented from the Aviation Community of recovery from mTBI. Each case presented is one who was monetarily incentivized to perform well on testing. RESULTS: All three cases passed established guidelines for performance validity testing. Each case recovered to estimated baseline performance, though one case needed additional time. There was some evidence of lowered processing speed on two of the three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with current literature on mTBI, recovery from injury is considered the rule as opposed to the exception. Though there are many studies examining how incentives to underperform hinder recovery, there is little research on how incentives to perform well may affect cognitive performance after mTBI. Such may be considered a gap in research and should be a focus of future work. © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved."

From an aviation perspective, safely operating an aircraft requires an airman's cognitive engagement for: 1) situational awareness, 2) spatial orientation, and 3) avionics programming. Since impaired cognitive function could interfere with such tasks, the current study was undertaken to determine if flight safety for a cohort of single engine, piston-powered light airplanes was adversely affected during a period of the pandemic (March-October 2020) prior to U.S. approval of the first COViD-19 vaccine. methods: airplane accidents were per the National transportation Safety Board access® database. Fleet times were derived using automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. Statistics used Poisson distributions, Chi-squared/ Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests. results: little difference in accident rate was evident between the pandemic period (March-October 2020) and the preceding (January-February) months (19 and 22 mishaps/100,000 h, respectively). Similarly, a proportional comparison of accidents occurring in 2020 with those for the corresponding months in 2019 failed to show over-representation of mishaps during the pandemic. although a trend to a higher injury severity (43% vs. 34% serious/fatal injuries) was evident for pandemic-period mishaps, the proportional difference was not statistically significant when referencing the corresponding months in 2019.

"Spatial orientation during gondola centrifugation with subjects upright versus supine: Evidence for Gestalt psychological mechanisms in vestibular perception","2021","Journal of Vestibular Research: Equilibrium and Orientation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117883867&partnerID=40&md5=f46a2c6b6fd3b1bfa4b7d0817409291e","BACKGROUND: Recent theories suggest that perception of complex self-motion is governed by familiarity of the motion pattern as a whole in 3D. OBJECTIVE: To explore how familiarity determines the perceived angular displacement with respect to the Earth during a simulated coordinated turn in a gondola centrifuge. METHOD: The centrifuge was accelerated to 2G (gondola displacement 60°) within 12.5 s. Using visual indicators in darkness, responses to the gondola displacement were recorded with subjects (n = 10) in two positions: sitting-upright, facing-forward versus lying-supine, feet-forwards. Each subject underwent 2×2 6-minute runs. RESULT: When upright, subjects indicated a tilt of initially 18.8±11.3°, declining with T = 66±37 s. In the supine position (subject's yaw plane coinciding with the plane of gondola displacement) the indicated displacement was negligible (-0.3±4.8°). CONCLUSION: Since the canal system is most responsive to stimuli in yaw, these findings are difficult to explain by bottom-up models. Rather, the motion pattern during acceleration would be recognized as a familiar or meaningful whole (entering a co-ordinated turn) only when the subject is upright. Presumably, the degree of familiarity is reflected in the subject's ability to discern and estimate a single stimulus component. Findings are discussed in connection with human factors in aviation and the principles of Gestalt psychology. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved."

METHOD: there were 406 international sh and lh pilots who completed the cross-sectional online survey. Pilots' sleep restrictions and fatigue-risk profiles (e.g., time pressure, late arrivals, minimum rest), sleep problems, fatigue severity, well-being, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and common mental disorders (CMD) were measured and compared for Sh and Ih pilots. results: although Sh and Ih pilots were scheduled for only 51.4-65.4% of the legally allowed duty and flight hours, 44.8% of Sh pilots reported severe fatigue (FSS > 4 to 4.9), and an additional 31.7% high fatigue (FSS > 5), compared with 34.7% and 37.3% LH pilots. Considerable sleep problems in >8 nights/mo were reported by 24.6% Sh vs. 23.5% LH pilots. Positive depression screenings were reported by 18.1% Sh and 19.3% LH pilots. Positive anxiety screenings were reported by 9.6% Sh and 5% LH pilots. Of all investigated pilots, 20% reported significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, and 7.23% had positive depression and anxiety screenings. LH pilots reported significantly better well-being than Sh pilots. conclusions: Our results show that even far less duty and flight hours than legally allowed according to flight time limitations lead to high levels of fatigue, sleep problems, and significant mental health issues among pilots. Sh pilots were even more affected than LH pilots. Pilots' fatigue should be considered an immediate threat to aviation safety and pilots' fitness to fly by promoting fatigue and burnout. © 2021 by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.

HRV measurement is a non-invasive method to evaluate relevant physiological changes in a human body. Physiological changes and cognitive processes are associated with the cardiac dynamic autonomic control, and thus to influence individuals’ ability to cope with fatigue and achieve resilience. As a dynamic process to be learned, resilience can be formed and improved through Quick Coherence Training in a short time. To study the regulatory effects of coherence training on Air Traffic Controllers’ (ATCOs) HRV and resilience ability, the HRV parameters of 34 qualified ATCOs before and after Quick Coherence Training (QCT) are collected and analysed by paired T-Test. Also, participants’ HRV at rest are recorded as baseline. The results show that the coherence, mean RR interval, SDNN, and RMSSD after QCT are significantly higher than before. The mean heart rate after QCT is significantly lower than before. The findings demonstrate that coherence has effective and efficient regulatory effects on coherence, mean RR interval, SDNN, mean heart rate, and RMSSD. Psychological coherence training can be an efficient method for ensuring ATCOs recover from fatigue and achieve resilience quickly during the short break in long-time continuing monitoring and controlling. The findings in the current research can have potential to be further developed for Fatigue Risk Management System which is required by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) to be applied for Air Navigation Services providers. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Understanding the neuro-cognitive processes involved in transforming physical auditory stimuli into cognitive representations is important in the study of aviation psychology as a great deal of information about the environment that pilots receive and use to manage their flight is auditory (e.g., radio communication). Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was collected while 51 pilots conducted a one-hour flight in a Cessna 172 full-scale simulator and were presented with auditory tones. Markers were simultaneously added to the EEG data to reflect the onset of each tone and the pilot button response they were tasked with. Grand average event-related potentials (ERPs) related to the auditory tones compared neural responses for both the older (51+ years) and younger (&lt;51 years) pilot groups. The relationship of age to accuracy of SA models was also investigated by indexing pilot mental models of the relevant environment. Findings showed that auditory information is not always well-integrated into SA models, and this was particularly true for older pilots. Furthermore, changes in how auditory information is processed in the brain may contribute to the negative age-effects seen in pilot SA. This research is important in informing efforts to enhance safety in general aviation. Effective strategies to improve pilot SA may include visual technologies to augment the auditory information available to pilots. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Background: Due to the job nature of flight attendants and the particularity of the work environment, it is determined that their psychology is always in the state of negative psychology. The main responsibility of a flight attendants is to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers on the flight. The positive psychology of a flight attendants is very important for the safety and service quality of civil aviation. Loving kindness meditation is a practice that allows practitioners to wish themselves and others happiness and maintain this emotional state anytime and anywhere. Loving kindness refers to giving happiness to oneself and other beings, which is not only a happy mood and a peaceful state of mind, but also a sound personality. Methods: Based on the current research status of sustainable design and related research results of service design, this study analyzes and studies the work and life of flight attendants, and extracts ISDT method for the “product design process” that affects the sustainable development of research and development activities, and use design practice cases as empirical evidence. Results: According to the concept and principle of ISDT, we developed an APP that integrates design thinking development model and mind mapping framework. It is used to guide the development process of loving kindness meditation APP. Conclusions: ISDT is a sustainable design method with the significance of moral positive energy. With the advantages of scientific and commercial design process, it guides design to be more inclusive and realizes the design vision of “design for positivity”. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The present work replies to the call for a human-centered research agenda by providing a systematic review of the literature for one of the most-widely researched concepts of SPO: the dedicated-support concept, which is also known as harbor pilot concept. Accordingly, a remote-copilot supports a single-piloted aircraft to alleviate high workload that can occur during nominal, off-nominal, and emergency situations. All studies of a recently published systematic literature review on SPO [1] were coded according to the categories of type of article, concept of operation, and method. The studies on the concept under analysis were systematically reviewed further to evaluate their contribution to its current state in human-centered design according to ISO 9241-210. The theoretical foundations of such SPO are elaborated in detail in modeling studies and accident analyses whereas empirical evaluation of design solutions has been started only in a few studies. Nonetheless, workload seems consistently be able to be distributed in a comparable range as in nowadays flight operations. In the end, the dedicated support concept of SPO is at early stages in the human-centered design process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"Are patients with cognitive impairment fit to fly? Current evidence and practical recommendations","2021","Journal of Travel Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100224222&partnerID=40&md5=899b5c1dc41838501a258cc77a81d766","Background: The worldwide prevalence of dementia is increasing and represents a major public health concern. In the last decades, air travel services have undergone an impressive expansion and one of ten passengers is aged 65 years and older. While air travel can be stressful at all ages and health conditions, older individuals with cognitive impairment carry a greater risk for air-travel-related complications. Consequently, demands to general practitioners for assessing their older patient’s fitness to fly are increasing. Methods: We conducted a search of the literature in PubMed on the impact of in-flight environmental changes on passengers with cognitive impairment and possible resulting complications. This set the base for a discussion on pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing in-flight complications in this vulnerable population. Results: While our research strategy identified a total of 11 articles related to older age and air travel, only three focused on passengers with cognitive impairment. Our literature review showed that the airplane environment may lead to a large spectrum of symptoms in passengers of all age groups. However, passengers with cognitive impairment due to neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk for experiencing the most extreme symptoms such as acute confusional state. Non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions at different stages of the travel process (before, during and after) can help prevent complications in this vulnerable population. Conclusion: The decision to let a patient with cognitive impairment fly requires a solid understanding of the in-flight environmental changes and their impact on older patients with cognitive impairment. Moreover, a sound weighing of the risks and benefits while considering different aspects of the patient’s history is demanded. In this regard, the role of the treating physicians and caregivers is essential along with the support of the medical department of the airline. © International Society of Travel Medicine 2020.

Background: Recent studies have measured depression levels in pilots but not the relationship between depression levels and coping strategies. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted with commercial pilots. A regression model was advanced to analyze the relationship between each frequency level of each coping strategy and PHQ-9 Scores, and the Odds ratio was interpreted. Results: Sources of WRS impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Not all pilots are suffering. Over half met threshold for mild depression. Nearly 60% are using coping mechanisms to manage WRS and its impact on wellbeing. Pilots using coping mechanisms such as sleep management, taking physical exercise, and diet management were found to have lower depression severity levels. The findings of this study underscore the need to advance new tools to enable pilot self-management of their health and wellbeing. This includes new training tools, enhanced checklists, and new digital tools to support wellbeing awareness, stress coping, and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit. Conclusions: Airlines and pilots need the right tools to safeguard the wellbeing and mental fitness of pilots and ensure flight safety.

"Re-examining the Pioneering Studies on Eye Movements in Aviation: Connecting the Past to the Present","2021","International Journal of Aerospace Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099464025&partnerID=40&md5=1c12f1a242b50c7859befe2f350070ef","Objective: To reduce the gap between old and new eye-tracking studies in aviation by raising the interest of the scientific community in some of the pioneering works. We present two emblematic cases: the misattributed origin of the use of eye-tracking techniques in aviation to Paul M. Fitts and his collaborators, and the forgotten (and often reinvented) oculometer training tape technique. Background: Over the last century, military and civilian researchers have used eye-tracking techniques to solve many challenges faced by the aviation industry, from assessing new graphical displays to testing procedural trainings. Yet, these techniques have been always classified as merely promising. The difficulty of using eye trackers outside of a laboratory environment, and the labor-intensive data extraction and interpretation procedures have long been considered a barrier to implementing eye-tracking techniques in aviation settings. Method: We revised original scientific articles as well as military and civilian technical reports on the use of eye-tracking techniques in aviation settings from the beginning of Aviation Psychology. Results: A systematic failure in recognizing and learning from the pioneering works might be a concomitant explanation for classifying the use of eye-tracking techniques as merely promising. Conclusion: Taking together past and present findings, it would not be over-optimistic to state that eye-tracking finally went from being a “promising” technique in aviation to a “proven” one. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"An exploration of perceived stress, burnout syndrome, and self-efficacy in a group of Polish air traffic controllers and maritime navigators: Similarities and differences","2021","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098647374&partnerID=40&md5=ac80ce65c67eae6560f0ed0508ad35cf","Background: This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the level of perceived stress and occupational burnout in groups of Polish maritime navigators and air traffic controllers. The study was part of research into occupational groups regarded as equally emotionally burdened. We tested the usability of a model linking occupational burnout, perceived stress, and seniority. Methods: The set of questionnaires, including the link burnout questionnaire, perceived stress scale—10, and generalized self-efficacy scale were distributed to 54 maritime navigators and 88 air traffic controllers (rate of return: 18–56%). Spearman’s rho, χ2 test, the Mann–Whitney U test, Cohen’s d and Hedge’s g coefficients, linear regression, and F statistic were used. Results: The assumption that persons employed in occupations with the special professional requirements as air traffic controllers and maritime navigator with a risk of strong, chronic emotional overload evaluate their life situation as less stressful than other employees was confirmed. A higher level of occupational burnout was observed in groups of controllers and navigators compared to an equally emotionally burdening occupational group of Polish firefighters, but not Polish psychiatrists. The research groups differed regarding the source of stress: fear of helplessness in the air traffic controller group and inefficacy in overcoming adversities in the maritime navigators. Maritime navigators reported a higher level of occupational burnout, deterioration of relations with coworkers, and disappointment with their work compared to the air traffic controllers. Conclusions: The results showed differences in factors linked to workplace demands and the personal predispositions of employees, and the role these may play in mutual relations between occupational burnout, life situation evaluation, and personal resources. We postulate that the level of perceived stress should be taken into account in the studies of occupational burnout syndrome. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
"Health risks and potential predictors of fatigue and sleepiness in airline cabin crew","2021","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098517739&partnerID=40&md5=aac6f79e457ed33cde6164e81e61888a","Background: Aviation pilots and cabin crew regularly undertake shift work, and may experience circadian disruption, restricted sleep, sleepiness and impaired health. Research on aviation fatigue and sleepiness has focused on pilots, with less being known about cabin crew. This study aimed to identify likely predictors of fatigue, sleepiness, shift work disorder (SWD) and depression in cabin crew. Methods: An online anonymous survey was distributed to active cabin crew around the world. It measured sleepiness, fatigue, and screened for insomnia, depression and SWD. Information on individuals’ habits and work schedules were collected. Results: 930 valid responses were analysed. 63.5% of the sample had abnormal levels of fatigue and 46.9% experienced excessive daytime sleepiness. 68.0% were at risk for SWD, 57.7% screened positive for insomnia, and 40.0% for depression. Caffeine and use of alcohol and drugs for sleep were independently associated with insomnia and SWD (p < 0.05), whereas, type of route (international, domestic, both) and number of duty days per week predicted fatigue (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Cabin crew had a high prevalence of fatigue, sleepiness and elevated risk for SWD, insomnia and depression. Many cabin crew engaged in behaviours detrimental to good sleep hygiene, highlighting targets for future interventional studies. © 2020 by the authors."
"Navigating the risks of flying during COVID-19: A review for safe air travel","2021","Journal of Travel Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097179668&partnerID=40&md5=473fc62b9463d21a5f0a4a0281b80ffc","Rationale for Review: With air travel restarting, there has been much discourse about the safety of flying during the pandemic. In travel medicine, risk assessment includes estimating baseline risk to the traveller, recognizing factors that may modify that risk, considering the role of interventions to decrease that risk and accounting for a traveller’s perception and tolerance of risk. The goals of this review are to identify the in-flight transmission risks of commercial air travel, provide recommendations about the risks of flying during the pandemic and propose strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Key Findings: The airline industry has taken a layered approach to increase passenger safety through effective onboard ventilation, extended ventilation at the gate, boarding and deplaning strategies, improved aircraft disinfection and pre-flight screening such as temperature checks and COVID-19 testing. Proximity to an index case may contribute to the risk of transmission more than the seat type or location. The use of face masks has significantly reduced onboard transmission, and mandatory in-flight mask-wearing policies are being enforced. Innovations such as digital health passports may help standardize screening entry requirements at airports and borders, allowing for a safer return to travel. Recommendations: In-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a real risk, which may be minimized by combining mitigation strategies and infection prevention measures including mandatory masking onboard, minimizing unmasked time while eating, turning on gasper airflow in-flight, frequent hand sanitizing, disinfecting high touch surfaces, promoting distancing while boarding and deplaning, limiting onboard passenger movement, implementing effective pre-flight screening measures and enhancing contact tracing capability. Assessing risk is a cornerstone of travel medicine. It is important to evaluate the multiple factors contributing to the cumulative risk of an individual traveller during the COVID-19 pandemic and to employ a multi-pronged approach to reduce that risk. © International Society of Travel Medicine 2020."

The development of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) such as the Predator and Reaper, combined with global communication networks, manned aircraft, and precision-strike capabilities, created a far-flung kill web that exploited permissive skies to target pernicious threats. Leveraging local surrogates and special operations forces along with increasingly sophisticated sensors and weapons, RPAs rendered high-value terrorists, enemy concentrations, and military infrastructure visible and vulnerable in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Somalia. Persistent surveillance-strike capabilities reduced risk to US and allied forces and fostered rapacious demand for RPAs as contemporary air warfare became increasingly remote, digitized, and precise. As the kill web’s architecture evolved, RPAs became vehicles of political expediency. Yet new questions emerged about the allure and efficacy of remote warfare and air power operations in countries not at war with the United States. © Cambridge University Press 2022."

As the COVID-19 pandemic plunged airlines into an unprecedented crisis, its impact on the mental health of flying cabin crews became the focus of a second survey. Methods: Flight attendants were surveyed online with DASS-21 in May 2019 (N = 105; sample 1) and April 2020 (N = 1119; sample 2), complemented with questions about working conditions (in 2019) and existential fears and fear of job loss (in 2020). Results: Sample 1 revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress highly correlated with the subjective assessment of working conditions, but not with objectifiable parameters. Sample 2 showed significant positive correlations between existential fears and fear of job loss with depression, anxiety and stress. Crew members, grounded in April 2020, showed significantly higher scores in depression and stress, while still flying individuals had more clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Mean value comparisons between sample 1 and 2 in DASS-21 revealed a significant increase in symptoms at the time of crisis with effect sizes of d = 0.63 for depression, d = 0.26 for anxiety, and d = 0.52 for stress. The incidence of clinically relevant symptoms among the respondents increased from 8 to 23% (depression), from 6 to 14% (anxiety), and from 8 to 24% (stress). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated work restrictions coincide with severe impairment of mental health of flying cabin crews, consistent with a mental health protecting function of labor. © Copyright © 2020 Görlich and Stadelmann."

In efforts to alleviate these problems in metropolitan cities, logistics companies plan to introduce a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service called air taxis. These are electric-powered vehicles that would be tested and operated in the forthcoming years by international transportation companies like Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk. Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4.

The process of humanitarization of advanced training programs ensures the growth of spirituality in the educational environment of a technical university for faculty members. The development of the educator’s spirituality is a transcendence of the alienation of the technical from morality in education. The purpose of the study: to determine how to develop the spirituality of an educator in an advanced training system. Research method: culturosophical, allows us to consider spirituality as the development of the highest value senses of culture. The theoretical part of the study in relation to a technical university considers: the multi-dimensionality understanding of spirituality; humanization as the essence of the manifestation of ‘human spirit’ in education, and humanitarization as a way of its implementation; humanitarization as a factor in the development of spirituality and a strategy for the formation of an understanding of the moral meaning of the engineering profession; humanitarian environment as the basis for the formation of spiritual, moral and cultural qualities of a person; dialogue as an imperative of the development of spirituality. The practical part of the study describes the results of the introduction by the author of a new program with a humanitarian component at the Center for Advanced Studies of Scientific and Pedagogical Workers of the Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University): humanization and humanitarization create a highly spiritual environment; the technocratic narrowness of engineering education is overcome by interdisciplinarity; the connection of all subsystems of the spiritual sphere of society is revealed. The complexity of realization the program is due to the difference in thinking styles (technical versus humanitarian) and the psychology of perception of unaccustomed information.

The theory of normal accidents serves as a lens to comprehend the hazard stemming from MAX design with dissonance between two critical systems: engine propulsion and flight control. Cooper’s framework further delineates lack of psychological safety during prototype development from the project’s inception along six dimensions: management/supervision, safety systems, risk, work pressure, competence, and procedures/rules. The analysis indicates dearth of leadership commitment for a safety culture under time pressure and budget constraint. Our results corroborate the paramount importance of the pilot’s extensive simulator training in order to test the interaction between the innovative Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System and human behavior response time. Lessons gleaned from the study include three insights. First, the importance of meticulously testing a prototype during the new product development stage and the hazard stemming from improvisation to extend the life of outdated engineering design. Second, the necessity of regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, undergoing a modernization process by invigorating their ranks with data scientists attuned to 21st century skills in big data analytics.

Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators’ mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that SƟ(ω), the power spectral density of theta (ɵ) waves (frequency range 4–7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that SƟ(ω) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Recent studies have demonstrated the possible improvements of ATCO selection and training processes by using physiological, speech and oculometric features related to stress resilience, cognitive load, visual attention and fatigue. The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a brain imaging technique which provides a good insight into brain activation by measuring the haemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex, which is one of the key brain areas responsible for complex cognitive behaviour, decision-making, working memory, and stress regulation. This paper focuses on the ATC performance competencies that could be measured with the fNIRS, demonstrates computational processing of signals obtained with this technique, and discusses the applicability of fNIRS measurements in the current ATC selection and training procedures.

Pilots need to be fit for duty and aware of risks that compromise their health/wellbeing. Recent studies suggest that work-related stress (WRS) impacts on pilot health and wellbeing, performance, and flight safety. This paper reports on the advancement of new tools for pilots and airlines to support the management of WRS and wellbeing. This follows from five phases of stakeholder evaluation research and analysis. Existing pre-flight checklists should be extended to enable the crew to evaluate their health and wellbeing. New checklists might be developed for use by pilots while off duty supporting an assessment of (1) their biopsychosocial health status and (2) how they are coping. This involves the advancement of phone apps with different wellness functions. Pending pilot consent, data captured in these tools might be shared in a de-identified format with the pilot’s airline. Existing airline safety management systems (SMS) and flight rostering/planning systems might be augmented to make use of this data from an operational and risk/safety management perspective. Fatigue risk management systems (and by implication airline rostering/flight planning systems) need to be extended to consider the relationship between fatigue risk and the other dimensions of a pilot’s wellbeing. Further, pending permission, pilot data might be shared with airline employee assistance program (EAP) personnel and aeromedical examiners. In addition, new training formats should be devised to support pilot coping skills. The proposed tools can support the management of WRS and wellbeing. In turn, this will support performance and safety. The pilot specific tools will enable the practice of healthy behaviors, which in turn strengthens a pilot’s resistance to stress. Healthy work relates to the creation of positive wellbeing within workplaces and workforces and has significant societal implications. Pilots face many occupational hazards that are part of their jobs. Pilots, the aviation industry, and society should recognize and support the many activities that contribute to positive wellbeing for pilots. Social justice is a basic premise for quality of employment and quality of life. © 2020 by the authors."

This study investigated the causal mechanisms of disruptive behavior by delayed passengers in three aspects: environmental, managerial, and personal. Data on flight delays at Shenzhen Airport in 2018 were collected and analyzed. The main factors leading to disruptive behavior by delayed passengers were identified, and an early warning model for disturbances was developed using multiple logistic regression and a back-propagation(BP) neural network. The results indicated that the proposed model and method were feasible. Compared to the logistic regression model, the BP neural network model had advantages in predicting disturbances by delayed passengers, showing higher prediction accuracy. The BP network weight analysis method was used to obtain the influence weight of each factor on behavior change of delayed passengers. The influence weight of different factors was obtained, providing an assistant decision-making method to address disruption from flight-delayed passengers. © 2020 Gu et al.

Moreover, a sense of stress/threat is described in the context of the high specificity of employees representing the 4.0 sector. Therefore, it provides additional insights into the psychological functioning of the employees in the aviation sector. The results show that both positive orientation and ego resilience might be seen as protective factors against a sense of threat and stress, while a type D personality is a risk factor of a higher level of those psychological states. The novelty of the presented research concerns a better understanding of the sense of stress/threat experienced by the employees in this sector, as well as verifying the relationships between psychological variables described in the literature as personal resources. © 2020 by the authors."
"Health and Lifestyle Factors of Australian Medical Radiation Workers: A Pilot Study Using Nuclear Medicine Technologists","2020","Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090491186&partnerID=40&md5=05f082e62dbdc1139c4915fc5e5c814b","The health effects of chronic low-dose radiation exposure are a subject of worldwide debate. These effects are difficult to assess because all low-dose exposure mechanisms must be accounted for, including background exposure, personal medical examinations, and environmental exposure such as aviation, as well as lifestyle choices contributing to disease. The current literature recommends investigation of lifestyle factors to fill in these gaps. The aim of this study was to pilot-test a survey developed to assess health and lifestyle factors for Australian medical radiation workers. Methods: A cohort of nuclear medicine technologists (NMTs) was selected to test the survey. The survey consisted of 53 questions relating to demographics, employment, lifestyle, and health. Data from the 2017-2018 Australian National Health Survey were used to compare the lifestyle choices and health of the participants with those of the Australian general population. Results: In total, 101 participants pilot-tested the survey. Overall, Australian NMTs make better lifestyle choices (more exercise, more vegetable intake, lower rates of smoking and alcohol consumption) resulting in lower rates of obesity than the Australian general population. NMTs had a higher reported health status than the Australian population, with lower levels of psychologic distress. Given the low age of NMTs participating in the study, the cancer incidence rate may be higher than that reported for the Australian general population; however, a larger sample size is required to provide more definitive results. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a widespread survey to assess health and lifestyle factors for the Australian medical radiation worker cohort. Comparison of survey results with data for the entire Australian population have highlighted the potential to increase the number of lifestyle questions.

"Flying in the Face of Climate Change: Quantitative psychological approach examining the social drivers of individual air travel","2020","Journal of Sustainable Tourism","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089980703&partnerID=40&md5=866a7a30c62779fcebc8beb7859dc498","Aviation contributes substantially to anthropogenic climate change. This paper situates individual behaviour changes alongside technological efficiency gains and policy processes in the search for significant emission reduction in the aviation sector. Using online survey methodology (N = 393) and expanding upon existing psychological perspectives on individual attitudes and behaviours, this study focuses on the social influence on air travel. Considering social identity and global social networks, two new instruments, the Cosmopolitan Identity Scale (CIS) and the Global Social Interconnectedness Score (GSIS), were introduced to capture the social drivers of air travel within standardized questionnaires. Different subgroups of travellers were clustered and compared along external and psychological variables, to allow the construction of more effective policies in the aviation sector. Overall, the awareness of environmental problems caused by flying led to a perceived dilemma between environmental attitudes and travel, which resulted in the engagement with carbon offsets. The global social interconnectedness, built through international experience, led to increased travel to visit friends and family, and an overall increase in flight kilometres. The social identification as a cosmopolitan was related to social media use and predicted flight kilometres directly, implying a particular sensitivity to social norm messages in online campaigns. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. Objective To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. Design An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. Setting Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) Participants 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. Results The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p = 0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p = 0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively). The aircrews were satisfied with the protocol and provided several practical suggestions. Conclusion The protocol was well received by the passengers and aircrews of the repatriation flights with some suggestions for improvement. © 2020 Pongpirul et al.

"Interventions to support the management of work-related stress (WRS) and wellbeing/mental health issues for commercial pilots","2020","Cognition, Technology and Work","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088779092&partnerID=40&md5=d33714c6d7cca909558c62070b104959","Research indicates that sources of work-related stress (WRS) impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Furthermore, specific features of the job can increase a pilot’s risk in relation to developing a mental health (MH) issue. It is impossible to remove all stress from the work life of pilots. A high stress situation may not necessarily be detrimental to the person, once they have learned to cope with it in a healthy manner. Nonetheless, risk pertaining to WRS need to be effectively managed by a pilot’s employer. Therefore, it is important to identify solutions at an airline and pilot self-management level. This paper reports on the findings of human factors research undertaken with commercial pilots pertaining to work-related stress (WRS) and its impact on wellbeing, performance, and safety. The findings of a series of co-design workshops and a follow-up anonymous survey were analysed to identify potential solutions at (1) an airline and (2) pilot self-management level. Potential solutions are framed in relation to six impact scenarios. Furthermore, they are located within the existing regulatory framework, including the latest implementation rules (IR), acceptable means of compliance (ACM), and guidance material (GM) as outlined by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA 2019). Proposed interventions should promote wellbeing and positive mental health while also addressing suffering and mental ill health. Airline interventions might focus on enhancing existing Safety Management System (SMS) approaches to better manage risks pertaining to WRS, advancing new tools to enable wellbeing briefing, risk assessment, and reporting, and training pilots in relation to MH awareness, risk identifying behaviour, and coping strategies. Furthermore, new role/functions might be introduced to support the implementation and management of WRS/wellbeing/MH safety/risk processes at an airline level. Requirements for new digital tools to support pilot awareness of WRS/wellbeing/MH, self-management of WRS/wellbeing/MH and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit are also proposed. Some of recommendations arising in this research require changes to the existing rule-making and/or modification to existing AMC and GM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Background: Recent research suggests startle (an autonomic response to an acute stimulus) following unexpected abnormal flight events can impact pilot performance and can increase the probability of a negative outcome following the event. Method: Information processing, physiological measures, and performance differences between responses to expected and unexpected flight events were compared. General aviation (GA) pilots flew a series of flights in a fixed-base flight simulator including two experimental flights which included an unexpected and an expected, engine failure. During the flights, heart rate, eye tracking, and flight data were recorded. Results: During the unexpected engine failure, pilots showed greater increases in heart rate and pupil dilation. Significant differences in scanning were evident with fewer areas scanned following the unexpected event. During the unexpected engine failure, performance was impaired when compared to the expected events. However, poor performance was not associated with higher levels of arousal. Conclusion: The study provides an empirical demonstration of impaired pilot response to unexpected events with associated symptoms consistent with the induction of startle. The present research builds on Landman et al.’s conceptual model of startle and surprise. Application: Standardized training protocols may not adequately prepare pilots to deal with the unexpected effects of startle in real-world encounters. Introducing greater variety into training events may be useful. The effects of startle in disrupting well-trained responses may also occur in areas other than aviation where critical events may occur unexpectedly or present in an unfamiliar manner. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."
"Climate and ties in workplace versus sense of danger and stress, based on empirical research in the aviation industry","2020","Sustainability (Switzerland)","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088017222&partnerID=40&md5=ec527189fd1360b7855f97a07b7df5f7","The climate of the workplace, as well as the issues of relations and ties in the professional environment have long aroused considerable interest among psychologists and management practitioners. The organizational climate, which is defined as a set of beliefs about the organization, its relations, the atmosphere of the workplace, circulation of communication, development opportunities, etc., has often been associated with well-being and job satisfaction. Performing work related to numerous stress factors and difficult situations may significantly affect how both the professional environment and employees' well-being are perceived. Many empirical studies concerning work psychology and organization, including the works of Rosenstiel and Boegel, Gonzales-Roma, Peiro, Schneider and Earhart underline the importance of the organization climate in the construction of efficient and effectively functioning organizations. One of its important aspects is the level of social relationships and cooperation within an organization. Ties in the workplace are defined as the quality and depth of relations between members of an organization. Studies presented in this paper are of an exploratory nature due to the sector specificity, i.e., aviation and provision of services related to ground control operations. The aim of the empirical research presented herein is to verify the assumption about mutual relations between such variables as the perceived climate of the workplace and interpersonal bonds, as well as experiencing negative emotional states, such as the sense of danger and stress. The psychological literature suggests that low evaluation of the organizational climate parameters should be related to worse, more negative evaluation of the workplace and that the dissatisfaction within the scope of ties and relations with employees affects the perception of stress and threat. In the course of the study, 326 persons working at Pyrzowice and Szymany (Poland) and Kosice (Slovakia) have been examined. Polish employees dominated in this group (250 persons). The remaining group was constituted of individuals working at the Kosice (Slovakia) airport. The respondents represent a specific professional group. The authors tried to learn the specificity of the stress and threat experiencing process due to organizational variables-such as aspects related to evaluation of the workplace and the feeling of ties. To achieve this goal, in the course of statistical analyses, models were built to predict the sense of danger and stress among the surveyed population. A hierarchical regression analysis was carried out in order to determine which of the variables allow predicting the sense of danger and stress in the examined occupational group. The results showed that the higher sense of threat was predicted by the less positive views about the workload, the social support and by the higher ratings of ties in the workplace. In this model, the statistically significant predictors of the sense of threat were the perception of workload (β = -0.184; s.e. = 0.29; t = -3.297; p < 0.001), the social support (β = -0.272; s.e. = 0.52; t = -3.916; p < 0.001) and ties in the workplace (β = 0.115; s.e. = 0.51; t = 2.162; p = 0.031). Additionally, the higher level of sense of stress was predicted by the less positive views about the workload, fair play and by the higher sense of threat. The final model explained 12% of all variability regarding the sense of stress (R2 = 0.115; F [8, 317] = 5.122; p < 0.001). In this model, the statistically significant predictors of the sense of stress were the workload (β = -0.120; s.e. = 0.11; t = -2.079; p = 0.038), sense of justice (β = 0.160; s.e. = 0.20; t = 1.965; p < 0.001) and the sense of threat (β = 0.219; s.e. = 0.02; t = 3.859; p < 0.001). The interest in employees from the aviation sector stems from the lack of empirical data on how people working in this industry function psychologically. This branch of industry is currently developing extremely dynamically and is expected to evolve even more in the wake of the industrial revolution 4.0. Work in the field of modern industry 4.0 forces the employees to acquire many important competencies related to managing new, automated working conditions. As suggested by some authors (Popkova, 2019; Neufeind, 2018), in the light of the 4.0 revolution, one must assume that both the requirements of the work environment and reactions and behavior of employees will differ from the more typical and stable organizational conditions. Meanwhile, in the light of automation and specificity of the industry in question, not much attention is paid to human resources, who-while cooperating in various teams (organic and inorganic)-experience various challenges, as well as difficulties resulting from their professional work. © 2020 by the authors."

In this article, we present an overview of the current state of research, describe a mobile toolkit for collecting ground truth data on cognitive state fluctuations, and detail the implementation of a wearable system to unobtrusively detect alertness changes in the wild. Understanding and monitoring circadian rhythms will lead to the development of interventions to support mental health, physical health, and will ease the negative consequences of time shifts inflicted by jet lag or shift-work. © 2002-2012 IEEE."

In this study, we examine decision quality and visual information foraging for DSSs with different known reliability levels. Thirty-six participants completed a financial fraud detection task, first unsupported and then supported by a DSS which highlighted important information sources. Participants were randomly allocated to four cohorts, being informed that the system's reliability was 100%, 90%, 80% or undisclosed. Results showed that only a DSS known to be 100% reliable resulted in participants systematically following its suggestions, increasing the percentage of correct classifications to a median of 100% while halving both, decision time and number of visually attended information sources. In all other conditions, the DSS had no effect on most visual sampling metrics, while decision quality of the human-DSS team was below the reliability level of the DSS. Knowledge of an even slightly unreliable system hence had a profound impact on joint decision making, with participants trusting their significantly worse performance more than the DSSs suggestions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Due to the applied nature of the aviation and aerospace disciplines, problem-based learning approaches implicitly seek to incorporate and develop such skills as part of the educational experience. Individual resilience is one example of a nontechnical competency sought by employers across high consequence, technology-based industries. However, a stronger shift from traditional lecture/lab course formats to more in-depth problem-based approaches can cause some learners to retreat from challenges due to early failures or from lack of sufficiently developed recovery techniques. This paper presents a theoretical model of individual resilience for applied engineering and technology-based learners. Such a model could assist instructors tailor pedagogical experiences to more fully integrate resilience during academic preparation. Toward this end, a cross-domain review from seminal and modern research on resilience theory from aviation/aerospace, education, medical and psychology literature was conducted. Five common resilience themes emerged: (1) Adversity persistence/perseverance; (2) Contextual awareness (picture making; visualizing and assessing problems and synthesizing decision strategies); (3) Self-directed/learning autonomy; (4) Change management and innovation, and (5) Social connectivity (peer relationships).

The goal of this paper is to explore the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety in Chinese airline pilots. 319 commercial civil pilots from China Southern Airlines Ltd. were investigated using three separate scales, which measured mindfulness, anxiety, and burnout. The results show that mindfulness has a negative effect on pilots' anxiety. Burnout partially mediates the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety. Thus, mindfulness primarily influences pilots’ anxiety indirectly, by affecting burnout. The findings with regard to mindfulness have important implications in terms of pilot selection and emotional intervention, which, if appropriately addressed, can contribute to improving aviation safety. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

However, little is known about how the rate of an increase in workload impacts multitasking performance, especially in the context of real-world tasks. We evaluated both gradual and sudden workload increases in the dynamic multitasking environment of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) command and control testbed and compared them to constant workload. Workload transitions were found to improve response time and accuracy compared to when workload was held constant at low or high. These results suggest that workload transitions may allow operators to better regulate mental resources. These findings can also inform the design of operations and technology to assist operators’ management of cognitive resources, which include negating the adverse effects of vigilance decrements during low workload periods and data overload during high workload periods. © Copyright © 2020 “IISE”."

This study aimed to analyse the effect of night and instrument flights in cortical arousal, autonomic modulation, muscle strength, and stress perception. 23 people were analysed (8 helicopter pilots, 4 helicopter mechanics–Spanish Air Forces–and 11 controls) before and after instrument and night flight exposition. Lactate and perceived exertion rose after flights. Anxiety was higher in instrument than in night flights. Pilots had a higher sense of anxiety before a flight compared to mechanics, although mechanics experienced a higher raise of heart rate during flight, with lower heart rate variability. Breath capacity was affected in pilots. Cortical arousal was more affected in unexperienced than in experienced aircrew during flights. These data suggest differences in their previous training. Practitioner summary: Night and instrument helicopter flights produced a different psychophysiological response of aircrew. These results could help to design specific training for aircrew that usually face instrument and night manoeuvres. Specific training based on high-intensity interval training integrated with reverse periodisation could improve their preparation.

Thus, it is important to investigate ways to reduce the impact of flying on the environment. According to the low-cost hypothesis, psychological variables, such as attitudes and subjective norms, ought to be better predictors of low-cost, as opposed to high-cost, behaviors. The underlying hypothesis is that with increasing costs, represented by short- vs. long-haul trips, psychological variables from the theory of planned behavior would be less predictive of intentions to reduce the environmental impact of one's air travel. An online questionnaire was used to collect data from a convenience sample of 134 participants. Theory of planned behavior variables predicted intentions to reduce the impact of flying in relation to short- and long-haul trips equally well, as indicated by the overlapping 84 percent confidence intervals of R2 from two multiple regression analyses. However, there was some evidence that people with strong intentions to reduce the impact of their travel planned to fly less on an upcoming trip than those with weak intentions.

Although the human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) is an available tool for human reliability derivation, it has not been applied in flight safety assessment. The traditional HEART suffers from imprecise calculation of the assessed proportion of affect (APOA) because it heavily depends on a single expert's judgment. It also fails to provide remedial measures for flight safety problems. To overcome these defects of the HEART, this study proposes an integrated human error quantification approach that uses the improved analytic hierarchy process method to determine the APOA values. Then, these values are fused to the HEART method to derive the human error probability. A certain flight task is completed to assess human reliability. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is a reasonable and feasible tool for quantifying human error probability and assessing flight safety in the aircraft manipulation process. In addition, the critical error-producing conditions influencing flight safety are identified, and improvement measures for high-error-rate operations are provided. The proposed method is useful for reducing the possibility of human error and enhancing flight safety levels in aircraft operation processes. © 2020 Guo, Sun.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively test the applicability of the role-rule model to explain the passengers’ likely behaviour in an emergency evacuation. A questionnaire survey of 500 respondents in Melbourne Airport in Australia and 450 respondents in Qingdao International Airport in China showed that passengers are likely to engage in expected behavioural responses or coping strategies (e.g., calling emergency services, leaving bags and belongings) and avoid non-typical coping strategies (e.g., pushing other passengers) in a fire evacuation. Further, passengers’ perceived coping strategies affected their perceived likelihood of evacuating safely. Passengers perceived that if they follow specific evacuation procedures, they would not be able to evacuate safely. Therefore, planners and managers should develop strategies and campaigns to educate people on the importance of evacuations way findings tools like emergency evacuation maps/plans, assembly area and public address systems during evacuation process.

Gibson and Paul M. Fitts, two psychologists who had, and continue to have, a substantial influence on research in perception, action, and human performance, had remarkable, parallel careers with roots in the U.S. Army Air Forces Aviation Psychology program in World War II. Fitts is widely regarded as founder of the applied field of engineering psychology and the basic field of human performance, both based on a human information processing approach. Gibson founded ecological psychology, a school of thought that runs counter to the information processing approach and adopts a radical empiricist approach to perception and action in natural environments. Despite the origins of their disparate views in applied aviation psychology and each having had major impacts on the field of psychology, Gibson and Fitts seem to have had little contact with each other, and their research traditions have continued primarily along separate paths to this day. In this article, we review the arcs of Fitts's and Gibson's careers, emphasizing similarities and differences historically and theoretically. We end with a discussion of why their approaches differed widely, whether attempts to reconcile them can be meaningful, and the importance of experimental psychologists attending to applied research problems. © 2020 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois."
"Investigating visual–spatial abilities in students and expert physical therapists","2020","Physiotherapy Canada","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086017836&partnerID=40&md5=a4425bd128ce32fa502626b32f941334","Purpose: Visual–spatial abilities (VSAs) – the aptitude for mentally processing, retaining, and manipulating visual input – are used by physical therapists in movement analysis. Superior VSAs have been demonstrated in experts compared with novices in other fields, including surgery, anatomy, and aviation, but no literature has investigated VSAs in physical therapy. The purpose of this study was to quantify VSAs in expert and student physical therapists and investi-gate the differences between the two groups. Our results could assist future researchers in identifying areas for skill development and improved clinical competency in students and novice therapists. Method: Expert physical therapists and first-year PT students completed four computerized VSA tests in the Psychology Experiment Building Language programme: Four-Choice Response, Sequential Pattern Comparison, Mental Rotation, and Situation Awareness. Results: A total of 16 participants were recruited for each group. Expert physical therapists responded more accurately to the Four-Choice Response test, but not significantly so (p = 0.06), and with a significantly slower response time than student physical therapists (p = 0.03). No other differences were found. Conclusions: These findings suggest that expert physical therapists use selective attention more effectively and may value accuracy over speed. No differences were found in other measures of VSAs. Further studies are required to confirm and expand our findings. © 2020, University of Toronto Press Inc.. All rights reserved."

"What do we know about travel for children with special health care needs? A review of the literature","2020","Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082771114&partnerID=40&md5=ff818a460b29c1f70ffe71ca0cbd6ece","Background: Children travel with their families, including children with chronic illness. We know that adults with chronic illness who travel are more likely than their healthy peers to become sick while traveling. A review of the literature was undertaken to identify what is known about traveling with children with special health care needs and to identify gaps in our knowledge. Methods: An Online search of the PubMed, CINAHL and Google databases of English language literature was conducted June 2016, October 2017, June 2018 and April 2019 using the terms children and travel, air travel, travel health, disabled child, children with special healthcare needs, parents of disabled children, vacations, recreation, international, wheelchairs, planning techniques, asthma, diabetes, altitude, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, sickle cell disease, depression, food allergies, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and seizures. The search was limited to years 2000-2019. A secondary search of relevant articles was conducted using the reference sections of articles identified in the primary search. Results: 185 papers were examined for travel health related outcomes for children and adults with chronic diseases. Articles were excluded if they addressed the educational needs of students with disabilities traveling abroad, did not directly address travel health (e.g travel skills, travel itineraries), contained outdated policy statements, or were case reports of a single patient. The remaining 84 papers were organized and reviewed by organ systems. The articles were primarily descriptive and did not lend themselves to a systematic review. Conclusion: Children traveling with chronic and complex health conditions are a heterogeneous group of vulnerable travelers. Closing the knowledge gap about how to best help these travelers requires a multipronged approach. Research is urgently needed to identify best practices for five of the most common chronic childhood diseases: asthma, depression, ADHD, food allergies and autism. For less common illnesses, ones typically cared for in specialty clinics, expert consensus opinion and multi-center studies are needed. Families and disease advocacy societies should be included in the research as they may have already identified the most pressing travel-related health concerns and solutions for these problems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Subsequent investigation and review teams examined the incident and considered potential lessons to maximize air safety. In this article, aviation industry clinical leaders, including the U.S. Federal Air Surgeon and Chief Psychiatrist from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), along with a professional pilot and collaborating forensic psychiatrists, discuss suicide-by-plane, evolving themes related to public safety responsibilities for psychiatrists treating pilots, and forensic trends in pilot evaluation for medical certification from an aerospace psychiatric perspective. We explore how psychiatric aspects of pilot fitness and aviation safety are examined across perspectives, including unsafe acts, preconditions, organizational factors, and unsafe supervision. We explore practices for civilian pilots and offer information related to military pilot fitness. Lessons from Germanwings are presented, as is the need for increased support for pilots who might be concerned about revealing mental health challenges for fear of loss of medical certification and pilot employment. The Air Line Pilots Association Pilot Assistance Network is highlighted as one example of pilots supporting pilots to increase airway safety. © 2020, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.

However, little attention has been given to the broader everyday social environment of deceased persons. The present study constitutes a qualitative exploration of the impact on colleagues and neighbors following the MH17 airplane disaster in the Ukraine, July 2014. Methods: Eighteen structured interviews were conducted with eleven colleagues and seven neighbors. The interviews focused on the relation(-ship) with the victim, on the disaster, the first days and weeks hereafter, and the status one and a half years after the crash. Results: Especially for colleagues and neighbors with an intensive, long-lasting relation and ties based on friendship and trust, the impact of the sudden death was large. The MH17 disaster was considered a special event, different from, for instance, an ""ordinary"" accident. It was actively covered by the media and a recurrent conversation topic in meetings with other people. In the workplace, employers and less involved colleagues show empathy for a limited period of time, but grief has an expiration date - a moment where it gets more difficult to others or influences productivity. The appreciation for rituals in the workplace or in the neighborhood varies. Conclusions: The interviews indicate a ""hierarchy of bereavement"". People are not part of the typical inner circle, but feel ""affected"" and experience little social recognition and acknowledgment, particularly in the longer term. As such, colleagues and neighbors may experience loneliness and/or isolation. Generally, there is no need to consult a practitioner, despite the experience of health complaints such as intrusive dreaming and lack of sleep. © 2020 The Author(s)."

The purpose of our study is to define the individual psychological characteristics that determine stress resistance inherent in climbers-sportsmenfacing high risks. 60 climbers from the Kyiv branch of the Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing and the climbing section of the National Aviation University (26 women and 34 men, aged 18 to 30 years old, M<inf>age</inf>= 24, SD = 1.57) are involved in this study. The researchers have used the following tests: Cattell's Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire,Eysenck Personality Inventory, Diagnostics of Stress-Resistance Level (‘Forecast’), the ""Personality Differential"" technique. High and average levels of stress resistance were detected in 42 rock climbers (70%) while most adults involved in non-extreme sports had the average levels of stress resistance. It is shown that climbers perceive a large number of situations as threatening and provoking the anxiety (the self-preservation instinct). High psychological variability and adaptability to external conditions are associated with low levels of neuroticism, high stability, and lability. Increasing the self-esteem of athletes boosts stress resistance. These research results allow us to conclude that the structure of stress resistance of athletes facing high risksis balanced and defined by one’s systemic volitional capabilities (strength and stability), self-control behavior (self-esteem) and features of the nervous system which are characterized by susceptibility to external events (neuroticism). © JPES."

This study will explore the change in Chute use before and after 2012 to better understand factors that increased usage and improved accident outcomes. Methods: Using the public National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database from January 1, 2001, through August 31, 2018, a regression model was developed to identify factors that may predict Chute use. Results: In accidents occurring after January 1, 2013, pilots were 5 times more likely to use the Chute, while 2.9 times less likely to use the Chute when the accident involved pilot-related causes. The presence of passengers did not predict Chute use. Injuries were likely to be more severe when the Chute was used outside the Chute altitude envelope. Discussion: In contrast to General Aviation (GA) overall, accidents outcomes in aircraft equipped with a Chute have seen great improvements between 2013 and 2018, with increased use of the Chute and improved injury outcomes. Results suggest that changes to pilot training in 2012 have increased the social acceptance of Chute use. Results highlight increased risk of injury outcomes for Chute use in accidents that occur outside the Chute altitude envelope. © 2020 Aerospace Medical Association."

Scholarly attention is urgently needed to address attitude and behaviour change that supports sector-wide emissions reduction. Informed by the longstanding field of consumer psychology, the innovative approach adopted in this paper is to critically address air travel behaviour change through the application of attitude function theory. An analysis of the literature reveals that current attitudes reflect industry myths, and are further hampered by travellers’ knowledge gaps regarding the relationship between aviation and climate change. Five attitude functions are analysed in the context of attitudes to air travel; knowledge, utilitarian, value-expressive, ego-defensive and social adjustive functions. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates attitude structure, attitude function and the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion as an innovative approach to address discretionary air travel and behaviour change at the level of the individual consumer. Utilizing this framework, future research can help develop a critical understanding of the antecedents that shape attitudes. Researchers will be better positioned to create persuasive messages aimed at changing attitudes towards air travel, as arguably the key step towards the illusive goal of significant behaviour change and a shift towards more sustainable tourist mobilities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"THE POLITICS, ADMINISTRATION, AND TOPONIMY OF IASI; POLITICĂ, ADMINISTRAŢIE ŞI TOPONIMIE IEŞEANĂ","2020","Anuar de Lingvistica si Istorie Literara","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206587551&partnerID=40&md5=eb9dfa32b4ec06e3784be235490ece1e","In a diachronic research of the names of places in Iasi, there are two main periods of time during which places got their current names. There is an old period, that ends (conventionally) in 1832, when the modern one starts. The criterium for defining these periods has been derived from the differences between the popular denomination and the official administrative denomination. The last one has a scientific component and its own lexical, phonetic, and grammatical characteristics (not described herein). During the modern period, the older popular toponymy has been gradually replaced in a four phases process. The first phase is a transitional one (1828–1864). During the second phase (1864–1946), the list of names was created and stabilized. The local administration named some streets that were previously unnamed or made slight modifications to names without completely erasing the past inferences. For the new toponymy, the authority activated the cultural memory of the community, by giving names of historical and political personalities, and also of artists and scientists. The residents in turn proved to be sensitive to these changes and adopted these new names. The common terms (entopics) used in the name structure started to take neological nuances. Through the third phase (1947–1989), the toponymic inventory is radically modified, many streets being destroyed as a consequence of the urban systematization and as an attempt to delete the historical memory that was characteristic for the Communist ideological propaganda. Specifically, there are two subperiods – the Stalinist and post-Stalinist one (1947–1965) and the National Communist period, under N. Ceausescu (1965–1989). During the fourth phase, after the Revolution of 1989, the toponymy reverts to names used prior to 1947, but also it is enriched with new names. Our research highlights new procedural aspects and also a new denominating mentality after 1864, when the administration imposes the street nomenclature that distinguishes the popular toponymy from the official and administrative toponymy. One of the problems is related to the motivation for changing these names. During the process of naming a street, which typically falls under the attribution of the City Hall, it was expected that the Mayor, a local personality himself, would have the honor of giving that name. The cult of personalities and historical events started in the 19th century. The names of Moldavian rulers as well as those of historical figures reflected in the current literature were selected relatively well. There were some streets named after members of the Royal family. Under the Mayor Osvald Racovita, names of cultural and scientific personalities were favored. In those times, the names of female personalities were insignificant on the toponymic map of Iasi. Only the names of Otilia Cazimir (a poetess) and of Emilia Humpel-Maiorescu (a teacher) were ever selected. The Jewish community was demographically well represented in Iasi, but no street received a Jewish name to acknowledge this significant presence. Racial discrimination was a reality in those times. The political interference in the local administration was at its highest level during the governing of O. Goga– A.C. Cuza (December 1937–February 1938), when the first to start the process of changing the street names were the Jews and the members of the Liberal opposition. The institutions that were involved in assigning names from their own professional area, especially after 1906, were the Garisson Iasi and Aviation Corps, which used the names of fallen soldiers and distinguished pilots. The Metropolitan diocese also tried to introduce in the street nomenclature the names of the most revered hierarchs in the history of the Moldavian Church. Various other institutions such as universities and theaters, and professional associations in the Liberal Art domain, have proposed a significant number of personality names, so that the honorary nomenclature of streets reflects this predominance. The names of great political and cultural personalities, of national relevance but also being in a direct connection with Iasi, started to be affected and changed only after 1947. The Communists, more determined and also favored by their long governing, profoundly changed the toponymic nomenclature across the entire country in an effort to delete from the collective memory those respected personalities considered political enemies. The names of those who supported the communist regimen were promoted instead, including scientific and cultural figures considered ”progressive”. The research ends by some observations and recommendations regarding the orthography of street names. © 2020, Academia Romana Institutul de Filologie Romana Alexandru Philippide.

It was found that out of 99 desirable professionally important qualities, organizational qualities are one of the main (30,3%) and become the main and determining (53,8%) of the 26 necessary professionally important qualities. The latter included: a high level of responsibility for the work performed, a small impossibility, the ability not to succumb to someone else’s influence, especially on the part of reputable persons, discipline, demanding, the ability to defend his point of view before the command, integrity, readiness and ability to accurately perform the prescribed actions and instructions, the ability not to prevent himself from working even to immediate superiors. Also, among the 26 necessary professionally important qualities, the second most important for flight safety are the qualities characterizing cognitive processes (15,4%), and the qualities characterizing knowledge (11,5%) become the third. The absence of negative moral attitudes such as the admissibility of material remuneration for professional services in addition to wages and a tendency to dependent behavior (gambling, psychostimulants, alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, Internet addiction, sexual or food dependence) plays an important role in the practical work of the aviation doctor.

In retrospect, it also marked the fullest flowering of a powerful, creative personality at the apogee of a purposefully directed life’s work. Naval aviation’s participation in Soviet anti-Sea Lines of Communication operations provides the margin of power necessary to hamper seriously the enemy’s antisubmarine warfare efforts, while surface combatants give the navy’s two primary offensive arms the stability to sustain such operations.

One of the most commonly used classes of medications to treat mental health disorders is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Here we present a descriptive epidemiological review of SSRI use in Army aviators over a 10-yr period. methods: An archival dataset retrieved from the U.S. Army Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office covering the years 2005 to 2015 was queried for cases of SSRI use. Frequencies were generated by primary diagnoses and aeromedical disposition for the SSRI subset of data. results: A total of 114 unique cases of SSRI use were identified (122 total aeromedical outcomes). These cases included 41 waiver recommendations, 59 suspension recommendations, and 22 cases of waiver continuations. The top five most common primary diagnoses were depressive disorder (N = 32), anxiety state (N = 21), posttraumatic stress disorder (N = 16), single major depressive episode (N = 13), and adjustment disorder with depressed mood (N = 12). discussion: Understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of mental health disorders particularly within the safety-focused and unforgiving aviation environment has continued to evolve. With the application of evidence-based policy, deliberate aeromedical decision-making, and methodical risk mitigation, SSRI use does have a place within aviation. Aviators ‘suffering in silence’ with deleterious impact to performance and safety or aircrew seeking services ‘on the outside’ without knowledge or oversight of certification authorities must remain in the past. © 2020. by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."
"Neural Correlates of Mental Workload in Virtual Flight Simulation","2020","Communications in Computer and Information Science","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097214769&partnerID=40&md5=096c0d1b826bdec34d40579665a72f14","Real-time monitoring of pilot mental workload has important applications in cognitive assessment and flight safety. Progress in wireless electroencephalography (EEG) and 3D flight simulation has provided novel opportunities to advance our understanding of adaptive levels of workload during flight. The present work examines neural correlates of mental workload evoked by ecologically valid flight tasks and furthers the application of human-computer interaction in aviation. Performance and EEG data were collected while 47 participants completed basic aviator tasks in a virtual reality environment where working memory load was manipulated. Analyses investigated event-related potentials (ERP) and spectral power density differences in moderate and high task load conditions across key brain regions. The subtle modulation of moderate to high workload did not reveal significant differences in frequency changes across parietal and frontal regions or participant performance; however, a frontal ERP showed a significant effect of workload. Classification by performance level showed better utility, where greater beta power was found in the parietal regions and increased delta activity was measured in the frontal regions. Results indicate that EEG analyses that exploit spectral data from the frontal and parietal regions may offer reliable approaches for classifying performance in high workload conditions in virtual aviation environments © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Cognitive Load Identification of Pilots Based on Physiological-Psychological Characteristics in Complex Environments","2020","Journal of Advanced Transportation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096522277&partnerID=40&md5=0249278d29281386cd6ecc8152433ff1","Cognitive load is generated by pilots in the process of information cognition about aircraft control, and it is closely related to flight safety. Cognitive load is the physiological and psychological need that a pilot produces when completing a mission. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the dynamic identification of the cognitive load of the pilot under the complex human-aircraft-environment interaction. In this paper, the airfield traffic pattern flight simulation experiment was designed and used to obtain the ECG physiological and NASA-TLX psychological data. The wavelet transform preprocessing and mathematical statistics analysis were applied on them, respectively. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation analysis method is used to select the characteristic indicators of psycho-physiological data after preprocessing. Based on the psycho-physiological characteristic indicators, the pilot's cognitive load identification model is constructed by combining RNN and LSTM. The results of this study are more accurate compared with the cognitive load identification models established by other methods such as RNN neural network and support vector machine. This research is able to provide a useful reference for preventing and reduction of human error caused by the cognitive load during flight missions. It will be potential to realize intelligent control of aircraft cockpit, improving the flight control behavior and maintaining flight safety. © 2020 Haibo Wang et al."

Non-core graduate departments of the University face the greatest difficulties in this process. The article discusses the main directions of career guidance work of the Department of ""Sociology, psychology and social management"" of the Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) in the course of implementing cooperation agreements with educational institutions in Moscow and the Moscow region. The authors present an experience of organizing and conducting research circles in sociology and social psychology for students of grades 8-11. The activity of the sociological research circle ""First steps in science"" was aimed at forming students' ideas about research, its methods and stages; developing skills of independent work with the received social information; obtaining skills for developing, conducting and presenting research results. The program of the circle ""Social psychology"" adapted for classes of humanitarian and socioeconomic orientation, included personal growth trainings and career guidance games aimed at developing professional self-determination in career planning. Research circles allowed school students to develop their special skills, arouse interest in sociology and psychology, improve their understanding of the criteria for their own professional choice, as well as form students' understanding of the Department's profile. During the implementation of career guidance measures in modern conditions, along with positive results, the authors have identified the factors that hinder the successful interaction of schools and universities such as the lack of involvement in this process of all subjects of the educational space, insufficient attention of the school administration to the social needs of graduating departments. To solve these problems, the authors have developed and proposed a model for organizing research circles based on schools, which can qualitatively improve the social partnership of all interested participants. The basic ideas and theses of the article may be of interest both for teachers of higher educational institutions and for pedagogical staff of secondary schools. © 2020 Moscow Polytechnic University.

The article presents the experience of the Department of sociology, psychology and social management of Moscow Aviation Institute in the development of teamwork skills among students majoring in engineering. Teamwork in the article is understood as an effective joint activity to achieve goals. Teamwork as a professional competence includes certain skills and abilities that are being formed gradually on the basis of interpersonal and intergroup communication. For the formation of team qualities, gamebased learning methods are used, which increase the effectiveness of pedagogical efforts. Game methods in comparison with traditional lectures and seminars involve more active communication, emotional colouring and visual demonstration of the results. The main task of a teacher is not to broadcast information and check its assimilation, but to stimulate the activity of students themselves. Game-based methods are both a diagnostic and corrective tool, they allow to identify already existing skills, activate the behaviour of students in the desired direction and consolidate the result. The article analyses the experience of using active training methods for the development of the competence ""teamwork and leadership"". Trainings are conducted in several stages, on each of them certain tasks are being solved: the current level of competence development is evaluated, tasks are performed together, results are discussed, and an exercise is given to reinforce the skill. After the trainings, change in the participants' attitude to teamwork and increase in the level of cohesion, trust, and involvement were revealed. The experience of organising of trainings turned out to be successful and useful not only for building competence, but also for identifying difficulties that prevent students from creating effective teams.

Throughout the evolution of manned missions, it’s clear to observe the tension development within the flight crews and with Mission Control. This report uses personal interviews, mission transcripts and astronauts’ memoirs to look closely at this evolving relationship, especially as the program grows and as it is gets shaped by changes in technology. In particular, this report delves into the conflict details in three of the most prominent examples: Mercury Atlas MA-7, Apollo 7 and Skylab IV. One common consequence of these three missions was that none of their astronauts ever flew in space again. However, more importantly, these missions uncovered a huge gap in NASA’s methodology of treating astronauts in their crews. This report evaluates how such events forced NASA to implement changes in the relationship between flight crew and Mission Control, in a way that accommodates for the crew’s psychological constraints, offering them more flexibility and understanding. The research also examines how the technology evolution of communications and tracking stations throughout the missions since Mercury until the International Space Station (ISS) affected the way the flight directors interacted with the flight crew. Additionally, this paper discusses the managerial and crew psychology perspective on this topic. Thus, the main goal of this research is to study the evolution of the relationship between the flight crew and Mission Control in order to understand how it was affected by major past mission conflicts and by evolving technologies because this understanding is a key for determining mission success especially in the future longer duration missions to Mars and beyond. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Since the late 1940’s, pilot selection techniques have included personality related questions (Olson, Walker, & Phillips, 2009; Callister, King, Retzlaff, & Marsh, 1999; Dolgin & Gib, 1988; Fiske, 1947). Unfortunately, despite the large number of different personality indexes used within this line of research, there has not been an aggregation of all aviation studies examining pilot personality and its impact on performance and success. In the current effort, a literature review was conducted to identify research that examined pilot personality traits, and a high-level summary of the findings related to trends in pilot personality traits is provided. The summary includes an examination of personality traits across the differing pilot categories (i.e., commercial, student, and military pilots) and pilot genders. When examining pilots, in general, compared to a general population, consistent with past research, pilots tend to exhibit personality traits lower in neuroticism, higher in extraversion, equivalent in openness, lower in agreeableness, and higher in conscientiousness. However, when different pilot categories are examined, the trends are not as ubiquitous. For instance, commercial pilots research consistently shows pilots to have higher levels of conscientiousness than the general population; however, for military and student pilots the results are not equivocal. We present here the methods and results associated with our review of the literature and provide a discussion of what can be gleaned and future research needed. © 2020 A publication of the University Aviation Association."

As important factors of risks were mentioned environmental dangers, such as: meteoroids, microgravity and cosmic radiation. The second source of hazards are biological and existential, which include space sickness and methods of life maintenance in the space, oxygen acquisition from water, spacecraft air quality maintenance, recommendations for decompression sickness, fatigue and sleep disorders prevention. One of the crucial problems during manned mission is the loss of mass and density bones. The paper also describes the psychological aspects, which are a vital element in planning the cure in the way it makes it more effective and keep their good mental health as distant space may be depressing. To calculate a risk level, for each of the analysed factor, the Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been used. This method allows to determine the value of risk based on the knowledge of the probability of its occurrence and possible effects. The obtained risk values are within the limits of acceptable risk, some of them can be reduced after a more thorough analysis or introduction of additional safeguards. On the basis of the analysis contained in the article, it can be concluded that the majority of threats can be effectively minimized or completely neutralized.

These scientific researches, which are currently conducted in didactics, psychology, information technology, computational mathematics, are inherently polydisciplinary, since didactic problems are solved by means of other scientific directions. At the same time, there are all prerequisites for conducting interdisciplinary research, the subject of which can be an electronic textbook. The purpose of this article is to substantiate the need for interdisciplinary research in the field of building electronic textbooks. In the main part of the work, the specific mathematical algorithms implemented in practice in the programming of the e-textbooks of the learning management system of the Moscow Aviation Institute are described. New mathematical approaches to designing an electronic textbook, in particular, a graph-oriented approach, are proposed. The model of forming a time-limited test is considered, where the weighted convolution of the normalized values is carried out by an optimization criterion: deviations of the test complexity from a given level and quantiles of the test execution time. The modern software technologies are used in the development of mathematical algorithmic module.

Postural control may affect a pilot’s ability to successfully deal with specific demands in airspace. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cognitive load on postural stability in the Czech Air Force. Eighteen pilots performed two trials of postural stability and a cognitive test between them. In the control group of fifteen pilots, participants were measured twice for postural stability with no cognitive load between them. Postural stability was quantified using force platform measures during quiet standing, and cognitive load was assessed by selected tests for spatial abilities while obstructing listening with a highly stressful recording of a crying baby. This study investigates the oscillations of body posture before and after the cognitive load with and without visual input. In the group of pilots with the cognitive load, an improvement in performance in postural stability was found. In contrast to the control group, postural stability in the pilots with the cognitive load was significantly affected by the cognitive task in the size of the ellipse area of the center of gravity while the participants had a smaller ellipse area of the center of gravity compared with the default situation. Cognitive load reduced body swaying, both with eyes open and eyes closed. The results indicate that cognitive load has an impact on some aspects of balance control, and cognitive load may arouse attentional resources and have a positive effect on individual postural stability. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

In this chapter we use a social psychology approach to discuss people’s behaviour in relation to cybersecurity, by considering human errors, personality traits, the relationship between attitude and behaviour and the influence of social and situational factors. Human error has been widely studied in literature, especially in aviation and health care fields. Regardless of the area involved, analysing human factors is fundamental to understand the causes of accidents. With respect to cybersecurity, in fact, human errors—deriving from, e.g., work pressure, distraction, lack of awareness, organizational factors—can be considered one of the most important causes of security breaches. Moreover, looking at the relationship between attitude and behaviour, we can see how individuals do not always behave in coherence with their beliefs. For instance, regarding the protection of personal data, while many people are convinced that this is absolutely needed, in practice they continue to share data and information on social media, underestimating the related risks and consequences. A global perspective in investigating human factors within organizations requires considering the work environment. Furthermore, an increasingly technological context exposes individuals to different stimuli and stressors, generating critical conditions—such as information overload and technostress—affecting individuals’ behaviour. Therefore, for effective adoption of secure behaviour, the management of employees’ well-being has to be included in cybersecurity awareness programmes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

It has recently been used in the analysis of procedures to reduce the risk of disease spread in airplanes, relying on the SPED model. This is a social force model inspired by molecular dynamics; pedestrians are treated as point particles, and their trajectories are determined in a simulation. A parameter sweep is performed to address uncertainties in human behavior, which requires a large number of simulations. The SPED model's slow speed is a bottleneck to performing a large parameter sweep. This is a severe impediment to delivering real-time results, which are often required in the course of decision meetings, especially during emergencies. We propose a new model, called CALM, to remove this limitation. It is designed to simulate a crowd's movement in constrained linear passageways, such as inside an aircraft. We show that CALM yields realistic results while improving performance by two orders of magnitude over the SPED model. © 2020 Sadeghi Lahijani et al.

This paper aims at understanding and addressing if there are unique psychophysiological patterns over time, a ”physiological temporal fingerprint”, that is associated with specific cognitive states. This preliminary work involves commercial airline pilots completing experimental benchmark task inductions of three cognitive states: 1) Channelized Attention (CA); 2) High Workload (HW); and 3) Low Workload (LW). We approach this objective by modeling these ""fingerprints"" through the use of Hidden Markov Models and Entropy analysis to evaluate if the transitions over time are complex or rhythmic/predictable by nature. Our results indicate that cognitive states do have unique complexity of physiological sequences that are statistically different from other cognitive states. More specifically, CA has a significantly higher temporal psychophysiological complexity than HW and LW in EEG and ECG telemetry signals. With regards to respiration telemetry, CA has a lower temporal psychophysiological complexity than HW and LW. Through our preliminary work, addressing this unique underpinning can inform whether these underlying dynamics can be utilized to understand how humans transition between cognitive states and for improved detection of cognitive states. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Current ULR scheduling for cabin crew is therefore predominantly based on flight crew data. Cabin crews’ views on fatigue, and their strategies for mitigating it, have seldom been sought. To better understand the causes and consequences of cabin crew fatigue, semi-structured focus group discussions were held. Thematic analysis was undertaken with data from 25 cabin crew. Participants indicated that the consequences of fatigue are twofold, affecting 1) cabin crew health and wellbeing and 2) safety (cabin, passenger and personal) and cabin service. While the primary causes of fatigue were sleep loss and circadian disruption, participants also identified other key factors including: insufficient rest, high workload, the work environment, a lack of company support, and insufficient fatigue management training. They highlighted the importance of sufficient rest, not only for obtaining adequate recovery sleep but also for achieving a work-life balance. They also highlighted the need for company support, effective communication, and management’s engagement with cabin crew in general. We recommend that priority is given to fatigue management training for cabin crew, which may also enhance perceived company support and assist with achieving a better work-life balance. © 2020 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health."

Method: A case-control study was conducted in the Universiti Putra Malaysia among eight military personnel, four of whom had chronic intermittent exposure to high altitude training. They were divided into two groups, chronic intermittent exposure group (CE) (n=4) and a control group (n=4). They underwent a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that utilised spatial working memory task to objectively evaluate the neural activation in response to the Tower of London paradigm. Each correct answer was given a score of one and the maximum achievable score was 100%. Results: A consecutive dichotomised group of CE (4/8) and control (4/8) of age-matched military aviation personnel with a mean age of 37.23±5.52 years; showed significant activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). This in turn was positively correlated with response accuracy. A significant difference in the response accuracy was noted among both the groups at p<0.05.

Operators are vulnerable to cognitive overload, despite support from system automation. This study tested whether attentional resource theory predicts impacts of cognitive demands on performance measures, including automation-dependence and stress. It also investigated individual differences in response to demands. One-hundred and 1 university student participants performed a multi-UAS simulation mission incorporating 2 surveillance tasks. Cognitive demands and level of automation (LOA) of key tasks were manipulated between-subjects. Results were partially consistent with predictions. Higher task demands impaired performance and elevated distress and workload, as expected. Higher LOA produced greater dependence on automation, but failed to mitigate workload. It was expected that, as the automation was quite reliable, participants would attempt to conserve resources by depending more on automation under high demand. In fact, the opposite tendency was observed. Individuals high in conscientiousness were especially likely to override the automation under high demand, apparently taking charge personally. Neuroticism and distress were also associated with performance, but results did not fit a resource theory interpretation. Thus, understanding impacts of overload in the multi-UAS context requires understanding operator strategy as well as resource insufficiency. Findings have implications for system design, and operator selection and training. © 2019 American Psychological Association"

We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: An evaluation system and related hardware on emergency coping ability based on continuous tracking task and psychophysiology measurement were developed. The reversed operation was used to provide emergency situation. A total of 13 pilots completed the continuous tracking task. Performance which was measured by the average distance deviated from the target track and heart rate, heart rate variability indexes were recorded by the system and were analyzed for the validity. Results: Tracking performance of norm tracking task are significantly higher than those of different reversed tracking phases, especially that of the first six seconds. The participants adapted to the reversed operation gradually after 6 s. Mean heartbeat rate and LF/HF ratio also increased in reversed tracking phase. Conclusions: Index of emergency coping ability could be derived from the difference between tracking performance and psychophysiology change of norm tracking task and reversed tracking phase. The emergency situation model and evaluation system were developed and validated. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

The indicators are examined through the attitude of ATC-students and professional ATCs to violations of the standards for the separation of aircrafts in horizontal flight. This made it possible to evaluate potential violations in well physically measured and interpreted distances between controlled aircraft. Quantitative indicators of violations were described in the algorithm for conducting personality-oriented simulator training of ATC-students.

However, prior findings may not reflect the complete picture of distress postloss, because they were focused on depression symptoms following nonviolent death. We examined trajectories of symptom-levels of persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a disaster-bereaved sample. We also investigated associations among these trajectories and background and loss-related factors, psychological support, and previous mental health complaints. Methods: Latent class growth modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of PCBD, depression, and PTSD symptoms in people who lost loved ones in a plane disaster in 2014. Participants (N = 172) completed questionnaires for PCBD, depression, and PTSD at 11, 22, 31, and 42 months postdisaster. Associations among class membership and background and loss-related variables, psychological support, and previous mental health complaints were examined using logistic regression analyses. Results: Two PCBD classes emerged: mild (81.8%) and chronic (18.2%) PCBD. For both depression and PTSD, three classes emerged: mild (85.6% and 85.2%), recovered (8.2% and 4.4%), and chronic trajectory (6.2% and 10.3%). People assigned to the chronic PCBD, depression, or PTSD class were less highly educated than people assigned to the mild/recovered classes. Conclusions: This is the first latent trajectory study that offers insights in individual differences in longitudinal symptom profiles of PCBD, depression, and PTSD in bereaved people. We found support for differential trajectories and predictors across the outcomes. © 2018, The Authors. Depression and Anxiety published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Yet, there is a gap in our understanding of how distances shape peoples’ travel choices. To understand global tourism patterns we map the flow of tourists around the world onto a complex network and study the impact of two types of distances, geographical and through the World Airline Network, a major infrastructure for tourism. We find that although the World Airline Network serves as infrastructural support for the International Tourism Network, the flow of tourism does not correlate strongly with the extent of flight connections available worldwide. Instead, unidirectional flows appear locally forming communities that shed light on global travelling behaviour since there is only a 15% probability of finding bidirectional tourism between a pair of countries. We find that most tourists travel to neighbouring countries and mainly cover larger distances when there is a direct flight, irrespective of the time it takes. This may be a consequence of one-way cyclic tourism that we uncover by analysing the triangles that are formed by the network of flows in the International Tourism Network. © 2019 Verma et al.

Recent Findings: Cigarette smoking and associated cessation attempts are associated with multiple hazards in flight to aviators including effects from nicotine intoxication, nicotine withdrawal, carbon monoxide intoxication, and side effects related to smoking cessation medications. Current civilian and military regulations place significant restrictions on the use of smoking cessation medications to aviators; however, recent research suggests that the hazards associated with these medications might be lower than the risk-associated unassisted nicotine withdrawal. Summary: An evidence-based approach to smoking cessation may require changing restrictions against smoking cessation medication use in US civilian and military aviators. Use and cessation of smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes require additional attention and research in this population. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."
"Influences of age, mental workload, and flight experience on cognitive performance and prefrontal activity in private pilots: a fNIRS study","2019","Scientific Reports","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066145983&partnerID=40&md5=08d9bbda9501a4763791d7faf44386df","The effects of aging on cognitive performance must be better understood, especially to protect older individuals who are engaged in risky activities (e.g. aviation). Current literature on executive functions suggests that brain compensatory mechanisms may counter cognitive deterioration due to aging, at least up to certain task load levels. The present study assesses this hypothesis in private pilots engaged in two executive tasks from the standardized CANTAB battery, namely Spatial Working Memory (SWM) and One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS). Sixty-one pilots from three age groups (young, middle-aged, older) performed these two tasks from low to very high difficulty levels, beyond those reported in previous aging studies. A fNIRS headband measured changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) in the prefrontal cortex. Results confirmed an overall effect of the difficulty level in the three age groups, with a decline in task performance and an increase in prefrontal HbO2 signal. Performance of older relative to younger pilots was impaired in both tasks, with the greatest impairment observed for the highest-load Spatial Working Memory task. Consistent with this behavioral deficit in older pilots, a plateau of prefrontal activity was observed at this highest-load level, suggesting that a ceiling in neural resources was reached. When behavioral performance was either equivalent between age groups or only slightly impaired in the older group, there were not any age-related differences in prefrontal activity. Finally, older pilots with extensive flying experience tend to show better preserved spatial working memory performance when compared to mildly-experienced of the same age group. The present findings are discussed in the frames of HAROLD and CRUNCH theoretical models of cognitive and neural aging, evoking the possibility that piloting expertise may contribute to preserve executive functions throughout adulthood. © 2019, The Author(s)."

The implementation of the method of brain photostimulation in the system of aviation personnel rehabilitation has been suggested following the investigation of visual analyzer stimulation by pulses of red, green, and blue light in the α-rhythm range. The goal of the present study was to improve vision and general psychophysiological state and to determine the length of the photostimulation course required to achieve a reliable effect. The duration of the sessions of electrostimulation was 10 min daily for several days. The effectiveness of the stimulation has been evaluated before and after the session using the WAM questionnaire and an alternative psychophysiological scale. It has been found that the course of stimulation of visual analyzer with blue, green, and red light pulses at the frequency of 10–16 Hz led to an improved psychophysiological state of the subjects. The repeated exposure to photostimulation had a cumulative effect and led to a significant improvement in well-being of all the subjects who underwent the photostimulation course of at least 6 sessions. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

A rehabilitation program consisting of a system of person-centered rational psychotherapy supported by a course of holotropic breathwork (breathing and ideomotor exercises) proved to be effective in abating preneurotic disorders. Altered states of consciousness achieved by holotropic breathwork have helped to correct rigid dominant mental conditions that distort the sense of professional motivation and deform behavioral typology. Therefore, holotropic breathwork recovers adaptability of pilot’s personality as a whole. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

However, there is natural tension between pilotsand flight surgeons. A pilot may be reluctant to share medical information with a flight surgeon who could negativelyimpact the pilot's career or flight status. In this preliminary study, we sought to identify pilot-perceived strengths andweaknesses in the relationship between U.S. Air Force aviators and their flight surgeons. Materials and Methods: Anonline survey regarding pilot-flight surgeon confidence and perceived values was distributed electronically to a convenience sample of U.S. Air Force aviators. Participants included U.S. Air Force active duty and Air Reserve Component(Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard) military aviators in addition to U.S. Air Force Academy aviation cadets.Results: One hundred and seventy-three aviators participated in the survey. Respondents reported variable comfort inapproaching flight surgeons with medical concerns and suggested that they believed other pilots might be withholdingmedical information from flight surgeons or seeking care from civilian physicians for career protection. Conclusions:We sought to examine the pilot-flight surgeon relationship and its impact on daily flying operations. While limited,results suggest that there may be gaps in trust between pilots and their flight surgeons. These findings could present anopportunity to improve the pilot-flight surgeon relationship by identifying factors that contribute to closer pilot-flightsurgeon relationships. © 2019 Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

"Early communication is key — Designing a new communication tool to immediately empower people with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures","2019","Epilepsy and Behavior","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073995601&partnerID=40&md5=b1cd12193427dba84d2e0fdb6acdd114","Introduction: Patient empowerment and shared decision-making has been increasingly recognized as key factors for a favorable prognosis. This is particularly true in complex brain disorders such as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) which go along with several challenges. People with PNES (PW-PNES) often feel lost in the healthcare system. Early clear communication is one of the few favorable prognostic variables. Our goal was to design a new ultrashort user-friendly communication tool allowing immediate patient empowerment. Methods: We conceptualized a design thinking process with patient engagement of PW-PNES. Together with a larger group of PW-PNES, we developed a comprehensive user-friendly 1-page document summarizing the key features of PNES. We applied document engineering (DE) as a cognitive science-based new methodology. Document engineering is well established in the aviation, oil, and mining industries and measurably reduces comprehension and performance errors. Results: The design thinking process encompassed 5 phases (empathize, ideate, define, prototype, and test). A prototype of a 1-page document, the 1-Pager-PNES, was created which contained the essential 7 domains organized in a simple structure such as a promise-question-answer (PQA) format. Information was kept poignant, complete, easy-to-read integrating cognitive principles to optimize navigation. The prototype “1-Pager-PNES” was subsequently tested in a 7-member focus group. All patients expressed significant improvement in understanding their disease and felt immediately empowered. Implementing their specific feedbacks, reiterative testing, and involving PNES experts resulted in the final version of the “1-Pager-PNES”. Conclusion: A promising new communication tool reduced to 1-page only is introduced which improves patient guidance and enables better coping mechanisms with this complex disease. The patient/user is empowered quickly through finding answers to pressing questions. Our study is unique for three reasons: 1) it engaged patients in the developing process, 2) it produced a tool for immediate communication for PW-PNES, which follows principles of human behavior and cognitive science, and 3) it used cross-industry thinking. Despite all limitations, we consider our small pilot study an inspiration for future studies with focus on patient empowerment through user-friendly documents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."
"Acute stress responses after indirect exposure to the MH17 airplane crash","2019","British Journal of Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056730085&partnerID=40&md5=523037f7130402500c4c01cf88c49178","People can experience disasters vicariously (indirectly) via conversation, social media, radio, and television, even when not directly involved in a disaster. This study examined whether vicarious exposure to the MH17-airplane crash in Ukraine, with 196 Dutch victims, elicited affective and somatic responses in Dutch adults about 2,600 km away, who happened to participate in an ongoing diary study. Participants (n = 141) filled out a diary three times a day for 30 days on their smartphones. Within-person changes in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) and somatic symptoms after the crash were studied. Additionally, we tested whether between-person differences in response could be explained by age, baseline personality (NEO-FFI-3), and media exposure. The MH17 crash elicited a small within-person decrease in PA and an increase in NA and somatic symptoms. This response waned after 3 days and returned to baseline at day four. The decrease in PA was larger in more extraverted participants but smaller in those higher on neuroticism or conscientiousness. The NA response was smaller in elderly. Personality did not seem to moderate the NA and somatic response, and neither did media exposure. Dutch participants showed small acute somatic and affective responses up till 3 days to a disaster that they had not directly witnessed. Vicariously experienced disasters can thus elicit affective-visceral responses indicative of acute stress reactions. Personality and age explained some of the individual differences in this reaction. © 2018 The Authors.

Motion-based flight simulators and other research devices provide the capacity to rigorously study SD in order to develop effective countermeasures. By applying mathematical models of human orientation perception, we propose an approach to improve control algorithms for motion-based flight simulators to study SD. Methods: The Disorientation Research Device (DRD), or the Kraken™, is the Department of Defense's newest and most capable aerospace medicine motion-based research device. We implemented an ""Observer"" model for predicting aircrew spatial orientation perception within the DRD, and perceptions experienced in flight. Further, we propose a framework that uses the model output, in addition to pilot control inputs, to optimize multiaxis motion control including human-in-theloop control capability. Results: A case study was performed to demonstrate the functionality of the framework. Additionally, the case study highlights both how limitations of human perception are crucial to consider when designing motion algorithms, and the challenges of effective flight simulation with multiple motion axes. Discussion: We implemented a mathematical model for spatial orientation perception to improve the design of control algorithms for motion-based flight simulators, using the DRD as an example application. We provide an example of predicting perceptions, producing quantitative information on the efficacy of motion control algorithms. This mathematical model based approach to validating motion control algorithms aims to improve the fidelity of ground-based SD research. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."
"Cognitive function in simulated paragliding flight","2019","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072709276&partnerID=40&md5=66557718d2f829e329ea9783d0c9c7d4","INTRODUCTION: Paragliding is an emerging discipline of aviation, with recreational pilots flying distances over 100 km. It remains risky. Accidents typically relate to pilot error rather than equipment failure. We measured cognition and physiological responses during simulated flight, to investigate whether errors might be due to pilot impairment, rather than misjudgment. METHODS: There were 10 male paraglider pilots (aged 19-58 yr) who undertook a simulated flight in an environmental chamber from sea level (0.209 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>) to 1524 m (0.174 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), 2438 m (0.156 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), and 3658 m (0.133 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), over approximately 2 h. They experienced normobaric hypoxia, environmental cooling and headwind, completing logical reasoning, mannikin, mathematical processing, Stroop Color-Word and Tower Puzzle tasks; as well as measures of risk-taking (BART), mood (POMS), and subjective experience. RESULTS: Results were compared to ten controls, matched by age, sex, and flying experience. Physiological measures were oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, ventilation, heart rate, oxygen saturation, rectal and skin temperatures, blood glucose, blood lactate, and urine production. There were no significant differences between pilots and controls at any altitude. Results were heterogenous within and between individuals. As altitude increased, oxygen consumption and minute volume increased significantly, while oxygen saturations fell (98.3% [baseline] to 88.5% [peak]). Rectal temperatures fell by a statistically (but not clinically) significant amount (37.6°C to 37.3°C), while finger skin temperatures dropped steeply (32.2°C to 13.9°C). DISCUSSION: Results suggest cognitive impairment is unlikely to be a primary cause of pilot error during paragliding flights (of less than 2 h, below 3658 m), though hand protection requires improvement. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

Project failure reporting is an important, but largely unexploited, source of learning that capitalizes on the learning opportunity of failure provided through the experience of navigating research-implementation ‘spaces’. Learning from others through reading available literature is one way to supplement learning gained through direct experience. Learning vicariously is especially effective when presenting failure as opposed to success experiences. We reviewed the peer-reviewed conservation science literature to identify the extent and characteristics of failed project reporting, focusing our analysis upon social dimensions as opposed to biological causes, which have been comparatively well addressed. We quantified the degree to which articles reported activities commonly applied to learn from failure in business, medicine, the military and commercial aviation. These included activities for identifying, analyzing, correcting and sharing project failures. We used qualitative thematic analysis to identify the social causes of project failure. Reports of failed project experiences are rare and lack standardization. Human dimensions of project failure, such as stakeholder relationships, are more commonly reported than other causes of failure. The peer-reviewed literature has the potential to become a useful repository of lessons learned from failed projects. However, practical challenges such as identifying individuals' cognitive biases, cultivating psychological safety in teams, mainstreaming systemic team learning behaviors, addressing varied leadership styles, and confronting fear of failure in organizational culture must be overcome if conservation professionals are to effectively navigate research-implementation ‘spaces’. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Identifying hangar noise pollutants can lead to find solutions and methods to deal with the contaminants in the aviation industry. In the first phase of the research, the sound study in each specified region of the hangar, the required measurements and frequency analysis are done to determine the type of sound control appropriate for the hangar. Measurements in this study were conducted in accordance with standards, and the results of the measurements and equilibrium calculations after recording were compared with the permissible exposure limits in accordance with the Occupational Exposure Limit values. The results show that the highest sound pressure level corresponds to sheet metal activities (128 dBC) and thereafter respectively, pneumatic systems (112 dBC), hydraulic pumps (104 dBC) and electrical systems (86 dBA), and found that noise pollution of the hangar during the specified time for shift and office personnel is higher than the permissible limits, and this exposure is harmful to the physical and mental health of the staff. In the second phase of the research, by the results of statistical analysis of the questionnaires, there was a significant relationship between the result of estimating noise intensity and the extent of its annoyance by shift and office personnel, which most people in the hangar believe that this level of noise pollution is very annoying. © 2019, Islamic Azad University.

Conducted in a South African aviation context, this study explored the phenomenon of peer support and its role and contribution as an effective response to addressing the emotional well-being of pilots. A qualitative phenomenological research design was followed using Rubin and Rubin?s in-depth, semi-structured interview technique to understand lived experiences of peer support. Nine interviews were held, six with airline pilots - a combination of peers and flight operations managers - and three with mental health professionals (MHPs). Braun and Clarke?s thematic analysis (TA) method elicited themes in relation to peer support and the mental health and well-being of pilots. Four themes emerged relating to (a) the conceptualization of peer support, the role of the peer, and the principles on which the process is founded; (b) pilots? experience of their workplace as emotionally ""unsafe"" and deficient in acknowledging the nature of different emotional stressors; (c) the well-being of pilots and medical certification of fitness for duty; and (d) the multidimensional contribution of peer support and factors critical to integrating successful and sustainable peer support. This study underscores the importance of developing a more integrated definition of safety in aviation that incorporates supporting the mental health and well-being of pilots. This paper addresses the role and contribution of peer support and considers some of the challenges to its integration as a safety initiative. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing."
"Mental Workload Drives Different Reorganizations of Functional Cortical Connectivity Between 2D and 3D Simulated Flight Experiments","2019","IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071999338&partnerID=40&md5=bad1079c7a1748a933aa42dd283823d0","Despite the apparent usefulness of efficient mental workload assessment in various real-world situations, the underlying neural mechanism remains largely unknown, and studies of the mental workload are limited to well-controlled cognitive tasks using a 2D computer screen. In this paper, we investigated functional brain network alterations in a simulated flight experiment with three mental workload levels and compared the reorganization pattern between computer screen (2D) and virtual reality (3D) interfaces. We constructed multiband functional networks in electroencephalogram (EEG) source space, which were further assessed in terms of network efficiency and workload classification performances. We found that increased alpha band efficiencies and beta band local efficiency were associated with elevated mental workload levels, while beta band global efficiency exhibited distinct development trends between 2D and 3D interfaces. Furthermore, using a small subset of connectivity features, we achieved a satisfactory multi-level workload classification accuracy in both interfaces (82% for both 2D and 3D). Further inspection of these discriminative connectivity subsets, we found predominant alpha band connectivity features followed by beta and theta band features with different topological patterns between 2D and 3D interfaces. These findings allow for a more comprehensive interpretation of the neural mechanisms of mental workload in relation to real-world assessment."
"Stress among ab-initio pilots: A model of contributing factors by AHP","2019","Journal of Air Transport Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069968596&partnerID=40&md5=20e79ef2755dbf5a419f71972596a346","Human error in the cockpit triggers a chain of incidences, which might lead in aviation to fatal consequences. Indeed, it is the highest contributor to aviation accidents, where stress is correlated positively. Despite the large research base for commercial or military pilots, there is no study related to the workplace stressors of ab-initio pilots. With these considerations in mind, the present study is set out to explore stress factors among ab-initio pilots in the university. For this purpose, stressors were isolated and assessed by interviews with flight instructors. Then, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to weigh those stressors among ab-initio pilots. A hierarchy was built with 3 criteria and 12 sub-criteria. Results showed that the most important criterion in stress among ab-initio pilots is personal factors, followed by organizational factors and environmental factors. Furthermore, the results revealed that the first four stressors within the global ranking were determined as the lack in body of knowledge, meteorological conditions, personality, and facilities and the fleet with the weights of 0.195, 0.154, 0.11 and 0.109. This work is unique due to its coverage of ab-initio pilots, and the results presented here may facilitate improvements in the evaluation of individual ab-initio pilots and the teaching environment for stress contributing factors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

As a second goal, it examined whether providing more autonomy to airport security officers (in the form of spontaneous rest breaks and adaptable automation) would improve their performance and subjective state. Seventy-two student participants had to indicate the presence (or absence) of a threat item (either a gun or a knife) in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of cabin baggage. Three work-rest schedules were examined: spontaneous breaks (i.e. participants could take breaks at any time), two 5-min breaks and two 10-min breaks during a 1-h testing session. Furthermore, half of the participants were assisted in their task by an adaptable support system offering three levels of automation: (1) no support, (2) cues indicating the presence of a potential threat item, and (3) cues indicating the exact location of a potential threat item. Results showed no performance differences between break regimes, which suggests that there may be viable alternatives to the current EU regulations. It also emerged that providing participants with adaptable automation did not lead to better detection performance but resulted in a less positive response bias than participants without automatic support. Implications for current aviation security regulations are discussed. © 2019 The Authors"
"Is your mind set? - How are intra- and interpersonal competences dealt with in medical education? A multi-professional qualitative study","2019","BMC Medical Education","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071289273&partnerID=40&md5=22e2797af4b4ad4b165c366ff2b6740c","Background: Professional intrapersonal and interpersonal competences (IICs) form an important part of medical expertise but are given little attention during clinical training. In other professional fields such as psychotherapy, education and aviation, training in IICs is an integral part of education and practice. In medicine, IICs tend to actually decline during studies. To date it is unclear why IICs are given less attention in medicine, despite evidence for their importance in the treatment process. In view of this, the study examined the role of IICs in the treatment process, the current situation of IIC training in medicine and, most importantly, the reasons for the comparatively low focus on IICs in the clinical training of medical students. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 experts from a variety of medical specialties and non-medical professions that provide a training with a stronger focus on IIC development. The interviews were evaluated using grounded theory. Results: The experts confirmed the idea that IICs are an equally important component in the treatment process, along with medical knowledge and technical skills. They also described large differences between the IICs possessed by physicians but noted a general developmental need. The key shortcoming was perceived to be a deep-seated defensiveness towards learning from mistakes and deficits e.g. through reflection and feedback. The interaction of different factors that seem to be reasons for this defensiveness and perpetuate it were identified: lack of support in dealing with insecurities in the face of responsibility; the notion of medicine as a science with the categories of right and wrong answers; and a range of pressures arising from the setting, such as hierarchical, economic and competition pressures. Conclusion: Our study showed, that the defensive attitude towards learning from mistakes and deficits especially in the field of IICs appears to be a subtle but powerful obstacle for implementing IICs in medical training, in contrast to other professional fields. This obstacle is sustained by various underlying barrier factors. We therefore propose that changes should be made within a cultural transformation targeting this defensive mindset and culture and its presumed reasons. © 2019 The Author(s)."
"Study on Influencing Factors of Controllers' Undesirable Stress Response Based on GRAY-DEMATEL Method","2019","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082396724&partnerID=40&md5=6dd768c51df068971957fc780910c8fb","In civil aviation transportation systems, air traffic controllers play a key role in maintaining safe, orderly and rapid air traffic flow management. Due to various undesirable stress influencing factors, the workload and work complexity of controllers have increased dramatically. In recent years, flight accidents or incidents caused by controller errors have occurred more frequently. Firstly, this paper proposes an evaluation framework that effectively identifies the key factors affecting the undesirable stress response of controllers, and extracts 20 main factors from the aspect of controllers' work ability, work complexity, work environment, safety atmosphere, and physical and mental health, etc. Secondly, the combination of Grey System Theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) Method is used to identify the factors affecting the controllers' undesirable stress response qualitatively and quantitatively. Lastly, we extract key factors from the 20 main factors, which can help us better cope with and reduce the undesirable stress response of controllers. The research results show that the key factors are the number of aircraft under control at the same time, emergencies, equipment reliability, airspace complexity, and emotional conditions. The research results aim to improve the controller's ability to adjust stress and improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic control. © 2019 IEEE."

However, little is known about factors relating to the work ability status of flight attendants. The aim of this study was to investigate the physical, mental, and work-related factors that affect flight attendants' work ability. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study and simple random sampling was conducted with participants employed at a Taiwan-based airline for longer than 1 yr. Analysis of variance and Pearson correlation tests were carried out to analyze work ability according to the flight attendants' social demographics, physical and mental health, and workrelated factors. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict the flight attendants' work abilities. RESULTS: A total of 472 flight attendants were recruited and the response rate was 78.67%. The work ability of the flight attendants ranged from 'moderate' to 'excellent' (WAI score, 34.1 6 1.8 to 45.1 6 1.5). In a regression analysis, work ability was positively associated with gender, age, and good eating habits; in contrast, insomnia and work-related burnout were negatively associated with work ability (R2 5 32.4%). DISCUSSION: Insomnia, work-related burnout, and eating habits had a significant impact on flight attendants' work abilities. Hence, it is important to address insomnia and high workloads and maintain a healthy lifestyle in the workplace. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association."

The measurement items of psychophysical questionnaire were ranked by 325 air force combat jet pilots. This study prioritized the causes of SD perceived by combat jet pilots resulted from the unfamiliarity with instruments on aircraft undergoing flight training, the aircraft's cockpit canopy and the layout of instruments in the cockpit. A significant difference was found between with-SD experience and without-SD experience subjects' responses from adapting to the size of instruments in the cockpit, and from the helmet-mounted display (HMD). Considerable association was discernible between the position of instruments in the cockpit and combat jet models accrued; as well as between the helmet-mounted display (HMD) and combat jet models accrued. The study identify main cockpit layout and design causing SD of Taiwanese pilots based on combat jet models to eliminate the risk of SD, intensify SD training on preventing SD and provide pilots with skills to anticipate and assess the risk of SD during mission planning, and provide references to the military for future procurement of new aircraft models. Relevance to industry: These results provide important information to the defense manufacturers for designing the cockpit layout of combat jets to prevent SD of specific pilots. Finally, the results show the contribution of ergonomics to support military operational commanders in the design of training and prevention of SD. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

In the transition from Person with Disability (PWD) act (1995) to Rights of Persons with Disabilities act (RPWD act) (2016), which covers all aspects of life of a person with any disability, epilepsy has been excluded from the list of disorders, resulting in a loss of many of the benefits that were earlier available to persons with epilepsy, causing concern to all caregivers of persons with epilepsy. Additionally, physicians/ pediatricians/ neurologists are not really aware of the benefits that are available to persons with epilepsy, especially children. To address these issues, an expert group meeting of pediatric neurologists and epileptologists in India along with social workers/epilepsy educators legal experts, parents, and teachers was held. The implication of epilepsy being dropped as a disability, was discussed, and most of the experts concurred that epilepsy should be considered as a disability, depending of the type of seizures or the epilepsy syndrome. Also, the current status of income tax benefits, child care benefits, travel concession, schooling and health insurance for children with epilepsy in India were also discussed.

Background: Despite health care systems implementing proven safety strategies from high reliability organisations, such as aviation and nuclear power, these have not been uniformly adopted by health care professionals with concerns raised about clinician engagement. Design: Instrumental, embedded case study design using qualitative methods. Methods: The study used purposeful sampling, and data was collected using focus groups and semi-structured interviews with doctors (n = 31); registered nurses (n = 19); and senior organisational managers (n = 3) in a New Zealand tertiary hospital. Results: Safety was described as a core organisational value. Clinicians appreciated proactive safety approaches characterized by anticipation and vigilance, where they expertly recognized and adapted to safety risks. Managers trusted evidence-based safety rules and approaches that recorded, categorized and measured safety. Conclusion and Implications for Nursing Management: It is important that nurse managers hold a more refined understanding about safety. Organisations are more likely to support safe patient care if cultural complexity is accounted for. Recognizing how different occupational groups perceive and respond to safety, rather than attempting to reinforce a uniform set of safety actions and responsibilities, is likely to bring together a shared understanding of safety, build trust and nurture safety culture. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

As a result of the study, three main stages of the formation of the methodology of flight training were distinguished: 1) formation; 2) handling; 3) improvement. The creation of military aviation in 1912 actualized the task of training professional personnel. The methodology of flight training at the formation stage was characterized by the active implementation of the advanced experience of outstanding pilot instructors, overcoming non-scientific pedagogical approaches. Starting from the 20s of the twentieth century, the methodology of flight training was formed on a scientific basis in conjunction with the formation of aviation medicine and aviation psychology. The concept of training began to take shape. Improvement of the methodology of flight training in the second half of the twentieth century by this day is determined by the trends of technical progress and departmental tasks; therefore, the modern methodology is characterized by “high technology”, “integrity”, “complexity”, “intended use” (military aviation), and “international standardization” (civil aviation). © 2019 LLC Ecological Help.

Reporting requirements for pilots vary across the world, and pilots can be subject to multiple national regulatory authorities for international flights. Stigma exists about getting treated for depression. If one’s livelihood and core sense of identity is placed at risk by seeking treatment, people will naturally avoid assessments and engagement with mental health clinicians, the very treatment that could mitigate risk. Suicide and homicide by aircraft are rare events and are difficult to predict, but the impact can be catastrophic. Variables other than mental illness, such as personality structure, occupational and relationship stressors, and coping mechanisms are also critical in conceptualizing risk in this population. Requirements for those employed in other methods of transportation are contrasted with those for pilots. Finally, legal and ethics concerns regarding reporting requirements for pilots are discussed and suggestions made. © 2019, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. All rights reserved."
"Strategic approach to managing human factors risk in aircraft maintenance organization: risk mapping","2019","Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059543196&partnerID=40&md5=5b66293b055cce259b73e39e28768c38","Purpose: Aviation has multi-cultural business environment in all aspects as operational and management. Managing aviation requires high awareness on human factor risk which includes organizational behavior-related topics. The greatest risk to an enterprise’s ability to achieve its strategic goals and objectives is the human factor. Both organizational behavior and corporate culture behavior with social psychology are the most vital aspects of management and strategy in terms of human resources. Related risks, including organizational behavior and culture, have the potential to directly impact on both business performance and corporate sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, the most prominent risks were determined in accordance with social psychology, and after identification of human factor-based risks, these have prioritized and prepared risk mapping with fresh approach. For this reason, this study aims to develop risk mapping model for human factors that takes into account interrelations among risk factors three dimensional based new approach. This approach includes both identification of human factor based risks, prioritization them and setting risk mapping according to corporate based qualifications via tailoring risk list. Developed risk map in this paper will help to manage corporate risks to achieve improved performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This new organizational behavior- and culture-focused risk mapping model developed in this study has the potential to make significant contribution to the management of the human factor for modern management and strategy. In enterprise risk management system, risk mapping is both strong and effective strategic methodology to manage ergonomics issue with strategic approach. Human factor is both determinative and also strategic element to both continuity and performance of business operations with safely and sound. In view of management and strategy, vitally, the human factor determines the outcome in both every business and every decision-making. Findings: It is assumed that, if managers manage human risk you may get advantages to achieving corporate strategies in timely manner. Aviation is sensitive sector for its ingredients: airports, airlines, air traffic management, aircraft maintenance, pilotage and ground handling. Aim of this paper is to present risk management approach to optimize human performance while minimizing both failures and errors by aircraft maintenance technician (AMT). This model may apply all human factors in other departments of aviation such as pilots and traffic controllers. AMT is key component of aircraft maintenance. Thus, errors made by AMTs will cause aircraft accidents or incidents or near miss incidents. In this study, new taxonomy model for human risk factors in aircraft maintenance organizations has been designed, and also new qualitative risk assessment as three dimensions is carried out by considering the factors affecting the AMT’s error obtained from extensive literature review and expert opinions in the field of aviation. Human error risks are first categorized into two main groups and sub three groups and then prioritized using the risk matrix via triple dimension as probability, severity and interrelations ratio between risks. Practical implications: Risk mapping is established to decide which risk management option they will apply for managers when they will look at this map. Managers may use risk map to both identify their managerial priorities and share sources to managing risks, and make decisions on risk handling options. This new model may be a useful new tool to manage ergonomic human factor-based risks in developing strategy in aviation business management. In addition, this paper will contribute to department of management and strategy and related literature. Originality/value: This study has originality via new modeling of risk matrix. In this study, dimension of risk analysis has been improved as three dimensions. This study has new approach and new assessment of risk with likelihood (probability), impact (severity) and interrelations ratio. This new model may be a useful new tool to both assess and prioritize mapping of ergonomic-based risks in business management. In addition, this research will contribute to aviation management and strategy literature and also enterprise risk management literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The second company of the Spanish Army Attack Helicopter Battalion (n = 15) performed three sets of standardized flight exercises with different levels of complexity (low [recognition flights], medium and high [emergency flights]). Throughout the flight exercises we recorded pilots' gaze entropy, as well as pilots' performance (assessed by an expert flight instructor) and subjective ratings of task load (assessed by the NASA-Task Load Index). Furthermore, we used pilots' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a reference physiological index for task load variations. We found that pilots’ gaze entropy decreased ∼2% (i.e., visual scanning became less erratic) while solving the emergency flight exercises, showing a significant decreasing trend with increasing complexity (p <.05). This is in consonance with the ∼12% increase in the frontal theta band of their EEG spectra during said exercises. Pilots' errors and subjective ratings of task load increased as flight complexity increased (p-values <.05). Gaze data suggest that pilots used nondeterministic visual patterns when the aircraft was in an error-free state (low complexity), and changed their scanning behavior, becoming more deterministic, once emergencies occurred (medium/high complexity). Overall, our findings indicate that gaze entropy can serve as a sensitive index of task load in aviation settings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

EEG and pupil diameter recordings were collected from 47 ATC students (27 more experienced and 20 less experienced) during a high-fidelity, variable workload approach-control scenario. Scenario workload was manipulated by increasing the number of aircraft released and the presence of a divided attention task. Results showed that scenario performance significantly degraded with increased aircraft and the presence of the divided attention task. No scenario performance differences were found between experience groups. The EEG engagement metric significantly differed between experience groups, with less experienced controllers exhibiting higher engagement than more experienced controllers. The EEG workload metric and pupil diameter were sensitive to workload manipulations but did not differentiate experience groups.

This observational field study aimed to provide a detailed picture of sleep and alertness among shift workers with a questionnaire-based SWD, by comparing them to shift workers without SWD during work shifts and free time. Methods: SWD was determined by a questionnaire. Questionnaires and 3-week field monitoring, including sleep diaries, actigraphy, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), EEG-based sleep recordings, and Psychomotor Vigilance Tasks (PVT), were used to study 22 SWD cases and 9 non-SWD workers. Results: The SWD group had a shorter subjective total sleep time and greater sleep debt before morning shifts than the non-SWD group. Unlike the non-SWD group, the SWD group showed little compensatory sleep on days off. The SWD group had lower objective sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency on most days, and reported poorer relaxation at bedtime and sleep quality across all days than the non-SWD group. The SWD group’s average KSS-sleepiness was higher than the non-SWD group’s sleepiness at the beginning and end of morning shifts and at the end of night shifts. The SWD group also had more lapses in PVT at the beginning of night shifts than the non-SWD group. Conclusions: The results indicate that SWD is related to disturbed sleep and alertness in association with both morning and night shifts, and to less compensatory sleep on days off. SWD seems to particularly associate with the quality of sleep. © 2018, The Author(s)."

It hinders people in performing their work and hampers family relations. Even though flight traffic has increased, there are new fears. Valid studies are needed to answer whether there have been changes in the prevalence of flight anxiety, are there sex differences in relation to fear of flying, use of alcohol, and tranquilizers, which situations cause the most flight anxiety, and whether the above factors have changed compared to a similar study from 1986. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to a representative random sample of the Norwegian population (N = 5500), where 36% answered. To assess flight anxiety across the time period, we used similar instruments to those we used in 1986. RESULTS: The prevalence of an assumed flight phobia decreased from 8% in 1986 to 3% in 2015. The percentage of those reported to never fly had decreased from 5% in 1986 to 0.5% in 2015. There were 11.0% who always used alcohol in 1986 and 7.5% in 2015 and 3% and 2%, respectively, always used tranquillizers. More women reported being afraid of both flying and other situations compared to men. Turbulence, unknown sounds, and fear of terror attacks caused the most anxiety. DISCUSSION: Flight anxiety still affects a considerable proportion of the Norwegian population and more women than men report that they are afraid of flying. However, in spite of methodology, people are significantly less afraid of flying than in 1986. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

The specialty was formally founded during World War I in the UK and the USA, and it was integral to many early concepts and interventions for psychological and neuropsychological trauma. It also established a fundamental basis for the psychological assessment and selection of military personnel. During and after World War II, military psychology continued to make significant contributions to aviation psychology, cognitive testing, rehabilitation psychology and many models of psychotherapy. Military psychology now consists of several subspecialties, including clinical, research and occupational psychology, with the latter often referred to in the USA as industrial/organisational psychology.

"Inattentional deafness to auditory alarms: Inter-individual differences, electrophysiological signature and single trial classification","2019","Behavioural Brain Research","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057826160&partnerID=40&md5=322da00f35c59e728bd9afa09e4cd573","Inattentional deafness can have deleterious consequences in complex real-life situations (e.g. healthcare, aviation) leading to miss critical auditory signals. Such failure of auditory attention is thought to rely on top-down biasing mechanisms at the central executive level. A complementary approach to account for this phenomenon is to consider the existence of visual dominance over hearing that could be implemented via direct visual-to-auditory pathways. To investigate this phenomenon, thirteen aircraft pilots, equipped with a 32-channel EEG system, faced a low and high workload scenarii along with an auditory oddball task in a motion flight simulator. Prior to the flying task, the pilots were screened to assess their working memory span and visual dominance susceptibility. The behavioral results disclosed that the volunteers missed 57.7% of the auditory alarms in the difficult condition. Among all evaluated capabilities, only the visual dominance index was predictive of the miss rate in the difficult scenario. These findings provide behavioral evidences that other early cross-modal competitive process than top down modulation process could account for inattentional deafness. The electrophysiological analyses showed that the miss over the hit alarms led to a significant amplitude reduction of early perceptual (N100) and late attentional (P3a and P3b) event-related potentials components. Eventually, we implemented an EEG-based processing pipeline to perform single-trial classification of inattentional deafness. The results indicate that this processing chain could be used in an ecological setting as it led to 72.2% mean accuracy to discriminate missed from hit auditory alarms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

"Medical Suspension in Female Army Rotary-Wing Aviators","2019","Military Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062882162&partnerID=40&md5=38ac9e0a06e0df58b78731d3870c56c2","Introduction Female aviators with health conditions may face a variety of occupational impacts. Outcomes may include a waiver for continued flight or a permanent suspension, in which flight is no longer possible. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of medical diagnosis among female U.S. Army aviators over a ten year period and identify associations of clinical diagnoses leading to waiver or permanent suspension. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary data analysis; data were retrieved on 1,282 female, rated aviator patients from an Army Aviation epidemiological database. The archival dataset was composed of a total of 6,856 cases between June 2005 and June 2015. Age ranged from 19 to 58 years. The data were examined in terms of raw ICD-9 diagnostic codes, grouped system diagnoses (diagnosis categories), and occupational consequence. Spearman's rho correlations were used to determine associations between diagnosis, waiver and permanent suspension. Results The leading diagnoses were pregnancy, normal delivery, and allergic rhinitis. The systems approach yielded pregnancy, orthopedic disorders, and spinal disorders as the leading diagnosis categories. Leading waivered conditions included spinal, psychiatric, and neurological disorders. In terms of permanent suspension, the leading cause was depression, followed by migraine and post-traumatic stress disorders. In almost all diagnostic groupings, the Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between age and diagnosis were positively related. However, age was not associated with negative occupational outcome (permanent suspension), generally. Conclusions A variety of conditions negatively impact the health and occupational status of female aviators, with disparate occupational impacts. Prevalent conditions differed from those reported previously for all aviators in a predominantly male population. The absence of cardiovascular disease is a significant change from 20-30 years ago. Among all medical diagnoses, a minority are responsible for a greater occupational burden. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States."

Using a cross-sectional survey, the roles of quality of life (QoL) and impact of event were examined against death anxiety of the proximate inhabitants of the crash site. Result showed significant influence of QoL on death anxiety, with higher QoL participants manifesting higher levels of death anxiety. However, impact of the crash event and demographic indicators such as age, sex, pilot preference, and belief-in-life after death did not influence death anxiety of participants. It can be concluded from these results that the perception of higher QoL has a profound influence on death anxiety of people reminiscing mortality reminders no matter their age, sex, beliefs, and life preferences. It is recommended that anxious death-related experiences be prevented in all spheres of life in pursuit of safety and sound mental health of the people. © The Author(s) 2017."

"Comparison of NASA-TLX scale, modified Cooper–Harper scale and mean inter-beat interval as measures of pilot mental workload during simulated flight tasks","2019","Ergonomics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060897782&partnerID=40&md5=2e616c065e483ad648d7a3d63e717226","The sensitivity of NASA-TLX scale, modified Cooper–Harper (MCH) scale and the mean inter-beat interval (IBI) of successive heart beats, as measures of pilot mental workload (MWL), were evaluated in a flight training device (FTD). Operational F/A-18C pilots flew instrument approaches with varying task loads. Pilots’ performance, subjective MWL ratings and IBI were measured. Based on the pilots’ performance, three performance categories were formed; high-, medium- and low-performance. Values of the subjective rating scales and IBI were compared between categories. It was found that all measures were able to differentiate most task conditions and there was a strong, positive correlation between NASA-TLX and MCH scale. An explicit link between IBI, NASA-TLX, MCH and performance was demonstrated. While NASA-TLX, MCH and IBI have all been previously used to measure MWL, this study is the first one to investigate their association in a modern FTD, using a realistic flying mission and operational pilots. Practitioner summary: NASA-TLX scale, MCH scale and the IBI were evaluated in a flight training device.

Data was collected over a five-day observational field trial at an international air cargo operator. Researchers recorded the activities of agents operating within the six key areas over three outbound and two inbound flights. Three networks (i.e. social, information and task) were created for four key phases of flight: (i) pre-flight checks and engines start (ii) taxi, take-off and assent, (iii) descent, landing and taxi, and (iv) park and shut down. The networks represent a ‘work audit’ of short-haul cargo operations, which enabled a detailed understanding of the interactions and connections within the current system. Implications for the future of distributed crewing concepts are discussed. Practitioner Summary: An analysis of the aviation system was undertaken using the amalgamated data from three outbound and two inbound flights. These analyses show the social, information and task interactions for cargo operations.

The aim of this study was to study the effect of hypoxia training in cortical arousal, autonomic modulation, muscle strength and cognitive function. We analysed 23 male aircrew personnel of the Spanish Army and Air Force (10 Helicopter Pilots, 7 Transport Aircrew, 3 Transport Pilots and 3 F-18 Fighter Pilots) before, during and after a normobaric hypoxia exposition. Hypoxia produced an increase in perceived stress and effort, a higher Heart Rate and a decreased function of breath muscles. Working memory and pattern recognition were impaired after hypoxia exposition. Significant differences were found in cognitive tests performance among aircrew groups, suggesting differences on their previous training. These results can improve specific training for better preparation of pilots and aircrews for hypoxic threats. Practitioner summary: Distinct aircrew preparation produces a different hypoxia exposition effect on psychophysiological response and cognitive functions. Hypoxia produced an increase in Heart Rate, a decreased function of breath muscles, being more negatively affected in Transport Pilots. Cognition abilities were impaired after hypoxia exposition, independently of the aircrew group. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"The impact of alerting designs on air traffic controller’s eye movement patterns and situation awareness","2019","Ergonomics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053067654&partnerID=40&md5=515df0c1372e24fdc55f6985cb6c95bb","This research investigated controller’ situation awareness by comparing COOPANS’s acoustic alerts with newly designed semantic alerts. The results demonstrate that ATCOs’ visual scan patterns had significant differences between acoustic and semantic designs. ATCOs established different eye movement patterns on fixations number, fixation duration and saccade velocity. Effective decision support systems require human-centered design with effective stimuli to direct ATCO’s attention to critical events. It is necessary to provide ATCOs with specific alerting information to reflect the nature of the critical situation in order to minimise the side effects of startle and inattentional deafness. Consequently, the design of a semantic alert can significantly reduce ATCOs’ response time, therefore providing valuable extra time in a time-limited situation to formulate and execute resolution strategies in critical air safety events. The findings of this research indicate that the context-specified design of semantic alerts could improve ATCO’s situational awareness and significantly reduce response time in the event of Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activation which alerts to two aircraft having less than the required lateral or vertical separation. Practitioner Summary: Eye movements are closely linked with visual attention and can be analysed to explore shifting attention whilst performing monitoring tasks. This research has found that context-specific designed semantic alerts facilitated improved ATCO cognitive processing by integrating visual and auditory resources. Semantic designs have been demonstrated to be superior to acoustic design by directing the operator’s attention more quickly to critical situations.Abbreviations: APW: area proximity warning; ASRS: aviation safety reporting system; ATC: air traffic control; ATCO: air traffic controller; ATM: air traffic management; COOPANS: cooperation between air navigation service providers; HCI: human-computer interaction; IAA: irish aviation authority; MSAW: minimum safe altitude warning; MTCD: medium-term conflict detection; SA: situation awareness; STCA: short term conflict alert; TP: trajectory prediction. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Using a large sample of airline pilots, we showed that 40% of the participating pilots experience high burnout. In line with Job Demands-Resources theory, job demands were detrimental for simulator training performance because they made pilots more exhausted and less able to craft their job, whereas job resources had a favourable effect because they reduced feelings of disengagement and increased job crafting. Moreover, burnout was negatively related to pilots’ happiness with life. These findings highlight the importance of psychosocial factors and health for valuable outcomes for both pilots and airlines. Practitioner Summary: Using an online survey among the members of a European pilots’ professional association, we examined the relationship between psychosocial factors (work characteristics, burnout) and outcomes (simulator training performance, happiness). Forty per cent of the participating pilots experience high burnout. Job demands were detrimental, whereas job resources were favourable for simulator training performance/happiness.

Subjective ratings of pilot perception of controller responsibility for five key flight tasks were obtained from thirty helicopter pilots. Three types of airspace were investigated. Results indicate that there is variation in pilot understanding of controller responsibility compared to the formal regulations that define controller responsibility. Significant differences in the perception of controller responsibility were found for the task of aircraft separation in class D airspace and along helicopter routes. Analysis of the patterns of response suggests that task type rather than the airspace type may be the key factor. Results are framed using the concept of a shared mental model. This research demonstrates that pilots flying in complex London airspace have an expectation of controller responsibility for certain flight tasks, in certain airspace types that is not supported by aviation regulation. Practitioner Summary: The responsibility for tasks during flight varies according to the flight rules used and airspace type. Helicopter pilots may attribute responsibility to controllers for tasks when controllers have no responsibility as defined by regulation. This variation between pilot perceptions of controller responsibility could affect safety within the London control zone. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Environmental cues typically used to guide interpretation of speed, location and approach can become obscured, forcing the pilots to rely on data available from in-cockpit instrumentation. To ease the task of flight during degraded visual conditions, pilots require easy access to flight critical information. The current study examined the effect of ‘Highways in the Sky’ symbology and a conformal virtual pad for landing presented using a Head Up Display (HUD) on pilots’ workload and situation awareness for both clear and degraded conditions across a series of simulated rotary-wing approach and landings. Results suggest that access to the HUD lead to significant improvements to pilots’ situation awareness, especially within degraded visual conditions. Importantly, access to the HUD facilitated pilot awareness in all conditions. Results are discussed in terms of future HUD development.

We have rules and biomathematical models governing the fatigue regulation, but the obvious link- the individual has only a subjective way of reporting one's fatigue level. The aim of the paper is to find an objective way to measure fatigue for the individual, through one component of fatigue - the sleep. This was tested with a commercially available tracking devise; first by comparing it with a medical sleep watch and then comparing subjective and objective fatigue of individuals responses and ultimately looking at the individual's personality and their sleep.

If work is appropriate to the physical characteristics and emotional characteristics of the employees, then that organization will be so successful. Managing the emotions of employees and waiting for employees to exhibit behaviors within the context of emotional labor is a success in the sense of management. Organizations can reach their goals and target income by managing employees ' emotions and thoughts. Emotional labor is a very positive outcome for organizations. Emotional labor improves customer satisfaction, increases the loyalty of the organization, improves the performance of the organization and emotionally enhancing the performance of employees. The choice of employees who can show behaviours under emotional labor is a very distinct administrative issue. Managers who want to be successful should make personality tests when choosing employees in this context. People who are prone to emotional labor behaviour will be more successful at showing emotional labor behaviours, and positively influenced by this emotional mood they are expected to have a higher level motivation with the lower intention of quit the job. In this regard, a survey was applied to the cabin crew, working in the aviation area, a total of 650 questionnaires were sent and 441 of them came back. After the review, 407 of these surveys were appropriate and analysed. The results showed that personality traids are important factors to emotional labor behaviours and intention to quit mediates the relation between personality and emotional labor behaviours. © 2020 The Author(s)."

Technological research has expanded rapidly as computer technology advanced and became more readily available. As a result, there are several ways to define autonomy across various domains such as the automotive industry and robotics today. This paper adapts the available body of knowledge to develop an analytical airworthiness framework for classifying autonomous functions for use in Army Aviation systems. The framework described comprises four stages, and starts with a clear analysis and allocation of the task(s) to be performed, thereby allowing classification of the type of automation involved. The level of automation can then be evaluated, leading to determination of a means by which the consequences of failure can be identified and used as part of a safety case that forms the basis for airworthiness determinations. © © 2019 by the Vertical Flight Society.

For example, Lunar and planetary surface crewed missions have a level of care equal to 4, as long-term missions lasting hundreds of days, like one of the most dangerous and complex scenarios of medical assistance and treatment. In contrast to specialised medical devices, future medical systems are expected to be used in diagnosis and treatment accounting of data from different domains (as emotions and environmental conditions). These systems shall actively assist the crew in decision making and in the management of their health and safety. Intelligent inflight medical systems are thought to be the most appropriate solution for integrating multidomain data. However, the use of AI in aerospace medicine may be questionable as AI builds on large data about known medical conditions, while there is little data about long-term missions in space and only a reference population, the astronaut population. Commercial crewed and space tourists might have inferior physical and mental performance than current formal astronauts. Therefore, astronaut-based AI might not be directly applicable to commercial astronauts, as this is population is exposed to a higher risk undergoing medical conditions in space. There is a need for addressing the use of AI from the phase-design to guarantee integration of AI-types when space flights will be opened to commercial astronauts. Thus, the innovation shall be addressed to a different end-user, which, in turn, may lead to a revision of standards and safety requirements. This work presents the development of an in-flight AI medical system built by design for allowing its application to both formal and commercial astronauts. The purpose of this project aims at establishing an autonomous bioelectric treatment for Terrestrial and in-flight brain medical care for counteracting hazards of human behavioural and mental health. Here, AI builds on multiple databases which include brain mapping of multi-domain data for the identification and recognition of functional and structural alterations of the brain at multiscale. The platform aims at controlling setting parameters of transcranial brain stimulation, as the neuromodulation technique through which a non-invasive painless treatment can be provided.

Based on initial assumptions, the target customers are expected to be 25 year old and beyond, pioneering individuals that belong to the innovator and early adopter groups of this lunar hotel's product lifecycle, and would psychographically have travel-based exploration and a fascination for science-fiction ingrained in their personalities. They would typically have a strong inclination towards adventure sports and expeditionary traveling. These consumers tend to have similar social circles and utilizing the emotion of fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to play a vital role in customer acquisition. Lunar Tourism is initially set to be marketed as very niche expeditions meant to be the highlight of a person's lifetime. Though the Lunar hotel would be more likely to attract wealthy tourists in its initial phases of development, the evolution of the space tourism market would be highly dependent on the development of low-cost launch services that would make the access to space affordable to the general public. In the meantime, a new market would have to be created for a niche customer group with high standards, which might not directly influence the democratization of space in the relatively short term but would be essential for the creation of an initial market and the development of the Lunar business ecosystem. As the demand increases, the competition among different stakeholders will increase and new, more diverse services for different niche market segments will be created. This survey should uncover insights on the demographic and psychographic characteristics of the target customers, the perceived value of Lunar Tourism from the perspective of the customers, and the demands and requirements of the customers, which would affect the design of the hotel and the types of services offered. © © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Rarely invoked, however, are the sensations of flight and the ways in which technology governs human interaction with the skies. In theorising an archaeology of airspace, this paper explores the remnants of two World War II aviation technologies. The first comprises the residues of wartime radar stations dotted along the Australian coastline. Sustained by generators and cabling, their electromagnetic beams projected a new domain of national sovereignty into the skies: airspace. The second case is the Cotton Aerodynamic Anti-G suit, a rubberised outfit designed to protect fighter pilots from ‘blackout’ during high-G manoeuvres. Analysing this assemblage prompts a phenomenological re-imagining of the physiology and psychology of airborne combat. Together, these artefacts illustrate how the material remains of aviation technologies can evoke both the experiential and electromagnetic realms of flight in the past. © 2019, Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology Incorporated.

"Depression and anxiety in pilots: A qualitative study of SSRI usage in U.S. aviation and evaluation of FAA standards and practices compared to ICAO states","2019","Collegiate Aviation Review","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077186487&partnerID=40&md5=a2b21f7162ab60ba637778cbdf7efb29","Before 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not allow airmen to exercise the privileges of pilot in command (PIC) of an aircraft or obtain a medical certificate if one had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and/or taking an SSRI medication. Since 2010, the FAA relaxed its views and certification standards. However, this is not an issue unique to the U.S. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other ICAO States began evaluating airmen suffering from anxiety, depression, and/or taking an SSRI medication in early 2000. ICAO and most ICAO States have identified the need for further research regarding mood disorders and airmen. In addition, ICAO has issued guidance regarding certification standards, though each ICAO State has the authority to set its own standards. While the FAA and the other ICAO States have accepted mood disorders in aviation as a reality, additional work is needed to unify standards within the international aviation community. ICAO States with more stringent standards, may force airmen to seek alternative treatment options and not disclose crucial medical information or seek appropriate treatment options in fear of reprisal. In 2018, a qualitative study was conducted that evaluated FAA medical certification standards for airmen suffering from mood disorders and compared them against medical certification standards of other ICAO State agencies and ICAO recommended practices. This qualitative study also evaluated U.S. pilot perceptions of the certification process, as well as views from a non-aviation medical physician using interviews and survey questionnaires. Responses were compared to current practices and evaluated. Findings from this study concluded that while FAA certification standards may be comparable to other ICAO States, general views regarding agency acceptance of mental health disorders can vary widely across State agencies. © 2019, University Aviation Association.

"Third-culture kid pilots and multi-cultural identity efects on pilots' attitudes","2019","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075518284&partnerID=40&md5=cc9c055d7899f15695a371e25e16b368","IP: 103.3.231.66 On: Thu, 09 Jan 2020 04:17:02 Copyright: Aerospace Medical Association BACKGROUND: Current attempts to culturally tailor human factors training in aviation segregates cultural identities based on geopoliti- cal, passport nationality, and is therefore poorly suited for (adult) 'Third Culture Kids' (TCKs) whose cross-cultural upbringing has led to the development of multicultural individual identities that do not relect their passport nationali- ties. In this study, respondents' self-categorization of personal cultural identity, as opposed to passport nationality, was used to determine whether there were cultural diferences in airline pilots' behaviors. METHOD: A survey with items imported from established scales was distributed to pilots of an international airline to measure pilots' work values, light management attitudes, and cultural dimensions, with respondents segregated into Western, TCK, or Asian cultural groups. RESULTS: TCKs shared similar work values with Westerners, were similarly individualistic, had comparable preference for shallow command gradients, were similarly pragmatic in self-evaluation of performance under stress, and both had lower dependency and preference for rules and procedures. TCKs scored in the middle between Westerners and Asians in automation preference attitudes, and on the cultural dimensions of power distance and uncertainty avoidance. TCKs did not share any similarities with Asians at all. DISCUSSION: The results show that TCKs were neither assimilated into a mainstream culture, nor culturally ""middle of the pack"" as may be expected from their ""East meets West"" backgrounds. Having identiied TCK pilots' unique values, attitudes, and dimensions, practical implications include changing training design to better suit TCKs' cultural characteristics and the adaptation of airline management to cater for TCKs' work values. © Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

It's commonly known that an intense amount of stress characterizes aviation professions which eventually results in affecting the employee's performance. The objectification and optimization of a workload concerning the environmental and ergonomie factors are being subjected to research. Some of the approaches take into account also psychological training of which actual effectivity hasn't yet been proven and thus, is not much supported. In this context, this paper examines so-called relaxation techniques as a form of increasing mental resilience in pilots. Myriad of relaxation techniques are used to release the tension and lower the workload. A selected combination of psychotherapeutic and physiological methods, specifically autosuggestion and affirmation techniques, Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation method and intentional breathing exercises, was selected for the purpose of this study. A change in the physiological parameters record and a level of error rate in the piloting technique was compared within subject groups in flight training, one without a previous practice of selected relaxation technique and two that underwent the relaxation training. © 2019 Kaunas University of Technology.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the current knowledge and attitudes of Turkish pulmonary physicians for air travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants and methods: A questionnaire was developed and administered either by congress mobile phone application or by e-mail. A total of 242 physicians participated in the study (75 by mobile phone application and 167 through the e-mail). Results: Among participants, only 30.6% reported that they usually inform COPD patients about possible risks of air travel in their routine practice. A preflight assessment was performed by 61.2% of them and a fit to fly report was prepared by 34.3%. The most common methods/tests used for preflight assessment were reported as oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis, and pulmonary function tests (51.2%, 50.8%, and 49.6%, respectively). When the participants were asked to plan safe air travel in two clinical case scenarios, only 16.2% were able to answer both cases correctly. Conclusion: This study shows that a standard approach for preflight assessment in patients with COPD is lacking and an active initiative is needed to increase awareness and education for fit to fly concept for COPD among pulmonologists. © 2019 Ergan et al."

Pilots are required to make weather-related preflight risk assessments to accept or reject a flight. This study's aim was to develop predictive risk assessment tools based on historical accident data to assist the decision-making process. METHODS: We analyzed 32 single-pilot HEMS night-time visual flight rules fatal accidents to identify contributory risk factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop prediction nomograms for nonvisual meteorological conditions (non-VMC), cause and nonsurvivable accidents as dependent variables. Risk factors such as temperature dew point spread, elevation difference, and years of HEMS pilot experience, were entered as continuous variables. Flight crew composition, pilot DTE (domain task experience) and flight rule capability, primary missions, and temperature dew point spread were entered as categorical variables. A point scoring matrix transposed model probability to likelihood and consequence severity. RESULTS: The nomograms correctly predicted the likelihood of entering non-VMC, accident cause, and sustaining a nonsurvivable accident in 75%, 55%, and 94% of cases, respectively. Using data from a recent nonsurvivable HEMS accident, the nomogram estimated a 92% probability (Very Likely) of nonsurvivable accident if visual cues were lost. CONCLUSION: These nomograms can provide preflight information to predict the likelihood of adverse safety outcomes occurring during a planned HEMS mission. While further development work is needed, this approach has the potential to improve HEMS operational safety. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association."

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between anticipated negative emotions (ANEs) and incident involvement among Chinese civil pilots. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of risk perception and proactive coping within the relationships in order to understand the mechanisms underlying pilots' involvement in air transport incidents. Methods: A cross-sectional regression design was used to measure ANEs (Anticipated Negative Emotions Scale), proactive coping (Proactive Coping Scale), risk perception (Pilot Risk Perception Scale), and incident involvement (Hazardous Events Scale) among 295 Chinese civil pilots from China Southern Airlines. Mediation and moderating effects were explored using regression analyses and were confirmed by the bootstrapping approach. Results: The results show that ANEs are significantly correlated with risk perception (r = - 0.55) and incident involvement (r = 0.28). ANEs have a direct effect on pilot involvement in incidents and have an indirect effect on pilot incident involvement through the influencing of risk perception. Proactive coping was also found to weaken the direct effect of anticipated negative emotions on incident involvement. Discussion: The safety benefits of proactive coping are more pronounced among pilots with high levels of ANEs. The practical implications of the study include recommendations relating to injury prevention efforts in incident involvement.

Flight violation evaluation indexes were selected from airlines’ Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) items. Then, an evaluation standard for violation behaviors was determined by investigating airlines, and a violation evaluation model for pilots was established. To examine the model’s reasonableness and explore the relationship between violation behavior and risk psychology, flight QAR data were analyzed, and pilot’s risk psychology characteristics were investigated by using psychological scales. In the case study, correlation analysis showed that landing vertical overload—a key factor in landing safety—was significantly negatively correlated with risk tolerance and significantly positively correlated with risk perception. Significant correlations among the violation indexes indicated interrelationships among the violation behaviors. This evaluation method can be applied to airlines’ FOQA to effectively and efficiently identify and control pilot’s violation behaviors.

Ninety-six participants completed a simulated supervisory control task where each automated display had a different level of reliability (namely 70%, 85% and 95%). In addition, participants completed a high and low workload condition. The performance data revealed that (1) participants’ failed to detect automation misses approximately 2.5 times more than automation false alarms, (2) participants’ had worse automation failure detection in the high workload condition and (3) participant automation failure detection remained mostly static across reliability. The eye tracking data revealed that participants spread their attention relatively equally across all three of the automated displays for the duration of the experiment. Together, these data support a system-wide trust approach as the default position of an individual monitoring multiple automated displays. Practitioner Summary: Given the rapid growth of automation throughout the workforce, there is an immediate need to better understand how humans monitor multiple automated displays concurrently. The data in this experiment support a system-wide trust approach as the default position of an individual monitoring multiple automated displays.

At present, it appears that minimal attention has been given to SA in the setting of paramedicine. OBJECTIVE: To map the state of existing literature evaluating SA in paramedicine. METHODS: To examine the breadth of knowledge available about SA and paramedicine. Searches of five electronic databases and grey literature were conducted to identify papers published related to SA and paramedicine. A narrative approach to synthesising and mapping the literature was used. RESULTS: The concepts of paramedicine and SA yielded 1,125 results which, after screening, included 20 papers for qualitative synthesis. While the literature does show that SA can be measured in allied health simulations, this review shows that there is a very limited empirical understanding of SA and paramedicine. CONCLUSIONS: While possessing SA has been shown to reduce accidents in other industries such as aviation and off-shore drilling, SA has not been researched in depth in paramedicine. Several knowledge gaps were identified that need further research including the potential effects of possessing, or not possessing, SA in paramedicine. © 2019 Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions.

So it is of profound significance to address how emotional factors affect flight training performance. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and simulated flight performance (SFP), and explore the mechanism of emotional state as a mediator in the effect of EI on SFP. METHODS: Ninety undergraduates took part in the study. EI (Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale), neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised), anxiety (State Anxiety Inventory), and tension (Profile of Mood States) were collected. Conducted were 9 h of simulated flight training in a simulator of the Type 6 Primary Trainer. The Delphi Experts Grading Method was used to assess students' SFP. Mediation effect of emotional state was explored using regression analysis. RESULTS: EI was significantly correlated with neuroticism (r = 20.31), tension (r = -0.31), and anxiety (r = -0.31), respectively. Multiple mediation effects showed that emotional state mediated the association between EI and SFP. Tension especially mediated the associations between the Self Emotion Appraisals and Regulation of Emotion dimensions of EI and SFP. However, the Use of Emotion dimension of EI had a direct negative effect on SFP without the mediating role of emotional state. DISCUSSION: The findings indicated that EI was significantly correlated with emotional state (neuroticism, tension, and anxiety). EI may directly or indirectly affect SFP and tension played an important mediating role.

The ability to maintain SA can deteriorate in stressful situations, exposing patients to dangerous errors. The literature regarding how to best teach SA techniques is sparse. This article explores specific techniques to promote and maintain SA in dynamic clinical environments using principles derived from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and human behavioral and organizational research. The authors propose strategies to help individuals and teams to develop ingrained, subconscious behaviors that can help to maintain effective SA in high-stress environments. Situation awareness (SA) is critical in high-stakes circumstances, such as the resuscitation of critically ill or injured patients. Exploratory research in psychology, neuroscience, human factors engineering, and to a lesser extent health care has led to a deeper understanding of what SA is and how it can be measured. Unfortunately, little is known about how we can adapt training in order to more consistently create behaviors that heighten SA during dynamic, high-stakes clinical events. In this article, the prevailing theory of SA is reviewed, and the evidence for evaluating it in medicine is presented. In addition, the authors draw from the fields of neuroscience and cognitive psychology to suggest some strategies that can develop effective behaviors that promote SA in resuscitation. © 2018 Air Medical Journal Associates"

The main objectives of this literature review are defined the ‘mental workload’ term and determined mental workload measurement methods in driving task. Mental Workload is a complex concept and it is difficult to define this term. It has no a universal accepted definition. Mental workload level cannot be detected directly, however, it has found that relates to limitation of individual internal resources to accomplish the task, and also involves a multi-dimensional variable. Previously, several studies have been indicated that mental workload relate with operators’ performance, task demand and mental resource supply. Extremes (underload or overload) mental workload can degrade operators’ performance. Several assessment methods have been proposed for investigating mental workload. They can be performed in experimental or operational settings. There are seven selection criteria to select the most appropriate methods. These include sensitivity, diagnosticity, intrusiveness, implementation requirement, operator acceptance, selectivity and bandwidth and reliability. Dozens of Mental workload measurement techniques have been developed and categorized into three main groups. (i) Subjective rating, which were categorized into unidimensional and multidimensional. NASA-TLX, SWAT, RSME and MCH are the famous examples of subjective-based techniques. (ii) Performance measures are divided into primary task and secondary task measures. Primary task measures are capable of discriminating the resource competition between individual differences. For example, speed instability, distance headway instability, lateral position from road centerline, lane excursion, time spent out of lane can be widely used to represent the driver primary performances. In secondary task measures are more diagnosticity than primary task measures and subjective measures. Correct response, time response of additional secondary task are a well-known examples of secondary task performance measures in driving research. Additionally, (iii) Physiological techniques also have high sensitivity in measurement, but results from these methods can easily are confounded by other external and extraneous interference.

The problems they face having to investigate violation of rules was the first object of our research. The context of accident investigation is also difficult to understand systemic causality. It is prescribed and also sometimes impossible to achieve, so this requirement of the task impacts on their reliability and health through an assessment process based on the way they write the reports which doesn't really reflect their real analysis. Nowadays we are starting a new Project with JIAAC which combines an ergonomic approach with a psychological approach to be able to prevent the consequences of their stress during contexts that are exposing them to critical event such as death, to the families suffering or to media pressure. This produces a level of stress added to all the organizational and judicial aspects that interfere with their work. Our goal as a team is to prevent as much as possible these factors to intervene, and when it is not possible to prevent them, we have combined our intervention with the necessary psychological assistance to avoid further PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) symptoms.

The NEO PI-R is a comprehensive and robust measure of personality that has been validated across cultures and contexts. Furthermore, the personality profile of the pilot sample was examined and compared to a normative sample representing the UK working population. Data from 591 pilots (95.1% male) were collected. Analyses include the internal reliability and factorial validity (precisely, Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling) to examine the measurement equivalence of the NEO PI-R with reference to UK norms (N = 1,301). Internal reliability estimates of the NEO PI-R scores were good at the domain level, but generally weak at the facet level. The structural model in the pilot sample was congruent with the general working population sample. Furthermore, there was convincing evidence for a distinct personality profile of civil pilots, although the stability of this profile will require further validation. The NEO PI-R's validity in the assessment of general personality in civil airline pilots is discussed, along with implications of the results for the utility of personality assessment in civil aviation contexts. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing."

Operational psychologists often provide consultation to aircrew selection, training, aviation operations, and human factors analysis in the wake of aviation-related accidents. The core of this consultation rests in a well-developed understanding of human factors and human performance interface between the aviator, the machine or technology, and the dynamic and often-unforgiving environment through which they operate. This chapter examines the role of operational psychology consultation across the spectrum of aviation operations. Prior to any description of applied consultation to aviation, a brief review of critical human information and performance systems is provided. This review includes discussions concerning the role of human information processing (attentional management, memory, judgment and decision making, communication, stress management, and concurrent task management) as they relate specifically to aviation operations and error analysis.. © 2019 by ABC-CLIO, LLC.

Our knowledge and our methods are of importance to the military service of our country, and it is our duty to cooperate to the fullest extent and immediately toward the increased efficiency of our Army and Navy. Operational psychology traces its origins back to the profession's involvement in World Wars I and II. During that period in U.S. history, psychologists were relied on to help assess, select, and place military service members based on their suitability for various positions in national security and defense (Brandon, 2011; Mangelsdorff, 2006). It was the former American Psychological Association (APA) president (Robert Yerkes) who, over 100 years ago, after witnessing the application of various hard sciences to the military in World War I, commissioned several committees to examine the potential role of psychology in the nation's defense.. © 2019 by ABC-CLIO, LLC.

In this age of asymmetric warfare, increasing home-grown terrorism, and continuing threats from abroad, a new specialty has emerged and expanded—operational psychology. Operational psychology plays a unique role in supporting issues of national security, national defense, and public safety. In this book, authors Mark A. Staal and Sally C. Harvey, both operational psychologists and retired military colonels, lead a team of experts explaining the field, its many roles, and how it is expanding. Topics include its application in intelligence, counterintelligence, and counterterrorism activities, consultation in high-risk training, criminal investigations including those of internet crimes against children, threat assessment, interrogations, aviation, personnel selection, and leadership development. The text addresses the ethical questions and controversies that surround some of these roles, such as those associated with interrogation techniques. It also describes the role of operational psychologists in activities ranging from assessing and training people for maximum resiliency and hardiness to profiling people and groups of concern in national security investigations. © 2019 by ABC-CLIO, LLC.

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. With roots planted firmly in the employment of psychologists focusing on the interplay between aviation assets and pilots during World War I and, then, in the selection of counterintelligence personnel during World War II and use by law enforcement in hostage situations in the 1970s, operational psychology continues to develop as a community of practice. Today, its practitioners apply psychological science to problems in national security, defense, law enforcement, and public safety. This practice has not been without controversy, as concerns with dual agency, multiple relationships, conflicts of interest, limits placed on informed consent, and the very nature of operational support activities have led some to characterize its practitioners as unethical and pawns of the organizations in which they work (LoCicero, 2017; Soldz, Arrigo, & Olsen, 2016).

"Investigating neural sensorimotor mechanisms underlying flight expertise in pilots: Preliminary data from an EEG study","2018","Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059010409&partnerID=40&md5=ef5fce149fbd873323ad1929e826abe0","Over the last decade, the efforts toward unraveling the complex interplay between the brain, body, and environment have set a promising line of research that utilizes neuroscience to study human performance in natural work contexts such as aviation. Thus, a relatively new discipline called neuroergonomics is holding the promise of studying the neural mechanisms underlying human performance in pursuit of both theoretical and practical insights. In this work, we utilized a neuroergonomic approach by combining insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition to study flight expertise. Specifically, we focused on the Mirror Neuron system as a key correlate for understanding the interaction between an individual and the environment, suggesting that it can be used to index changes in the coupling of perception-action associated with skill development. In this study, we measured the EEG mu suppression as a proxy of the Mirror Neuron system in experts (pilots) and novices while performing a distance estimation task in a landing scenario. To survey the specificity of this measure, we considered central, parietal and occipital electrode pools and analyzed alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (18–25 Hz) rhythm bands. We hypothesized that in experts vs. novices, specific neural sensorimotor brain activity would underpin the connection between perception and action in an in-flight context. Preliminary results indicate that alpha and beta rhythm suppression was area-specific irrespective of groups, present in the central electrodes placed over the motor areas. Group analysis revealed that specifically alpha mu rhythm, but not beta, was significantly more suppressed in pilots vs. novices. Complementing these findings we found a trend in which the strength of mu suppression increased with the sense of presence experienced by the pilots. Such sensorimotor activation is in line with the idea that for a pilot, a distance judgment is intimately associated with the function of landing. This reflects the ability to use optical invariants to see the world in terms of the capabilities of the aircraft (e.g., reachability and glide angle). These preliminary findings support the role of embodied simulation mechanisms in visual perception and add important insights into a practical understanding of flight expertise, suggesting sensorimotor mechanisms as potential neuro-markers. © 2018 Sestito, Harel, Nador and Flach."

When personal data is inappropriately collected or misused, however, individuals may experience violations of their privacy. Historically, government regulators have relied on the concept of risk in energy, aviation and medicine, among other domains, to determine the extent to which products and services may harm the public. To address privacy concerns in government-controlled information technology, government agencies are advocating to adapt similar risk management frameworks to privacy. Despite the recent shift toward a risk-managed approach for privacy, to our knowledge, there are no empirical methods to determine which personal data are most at-risk and which contextual factors increase or decrease that risk. To this end, we introduce an empirical framework in this article that consists of factorial vignette surveys that can be used to measure the effect of different factors and their levels on privacy risk. We report a series of experiments to measure perceived privacy risk using the proposed framework, which are based on expressed preferences, and which we define as an individual's willingness to share their personal data with others given the likelihood of a potential privacy harm. These experiments control for one or more of the six factors affecting an individual's willingness to share their information: data type, computer type, data purpose, privacy harm, harm likelihood, and individual demographic factors, such as age range, gender, education level, ethnicity, and household income. To measure likelihood, we introduce and evaluate a new likelihood scale based on construal level theory in psychology. The scale frames individual attitudes about risk likelihood based on social and physical distance to the privacy harm. The findings include predictions about the extent to which the above factors correspond to risk acceptance, including that perceived risk is lower for induced disclosure harms when compared to surveillance and insecurity harms as defined in Solove's Taxonomy of Privacy. We also found that participants are more willing to share their information when they perceive the benefits of sharing. In addition, we found that likelihood was not a multiplicative factor in computing privacy risk perception, which challenges conventional theories of privacy risk in the privacy and security community. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."

Methods: Examined the prevalence over a 5-year period. The percentage of personnel who were granted a waiver to return to flying duty following treatment was also determined. Results: The results revealed a 5-year prevalence of 0.036 (95% CI = 0.034–0.038) for personnel experiencing one or more of the mental disorders (N = 1,155). Prevalence was highest for adjustment disorders and for nonpilot participants. Overall, personnel were granted a waiver 55.3% of the time and suspended or disqualified 44.7% of the time. Waivers were more likely to be granted for an adjustment disorder and for pilots. Conclusions: Discussion focuses on the importance of aviation personnel receiving mental health treatment when problems are not severe to maximize the likelihood of returning to duty. Published 2018.

Pilot homicide-suicide, as a special subtype of pilot incapacitation, can be examined at different levels of commercial aviation. We extended the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), based on the System Theoretic Accident Modelling and Process (STAMP), to pilot behaviour to investigate how these knock-out events may be encountered in the whole system. Several safety actions have been identified to prevent hazardous pilot behaviour caused by medical incapacitation and homicidal-suicidal behaviour at different levels of the system. Pilot incapacitation is already handled very well in practice with respect to the regulations and procedures in current usage. In contrast, the prevention of pilot homicide-suicide is currently managed by aeromedical decision-making regulations and pilot support programs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effect the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks had on pilot AASs in the U.S. Fatal aviation accidents in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database were searched using the following search words: “suicide”, “murder-suicide” and “homicide-suicide”. The timeline between 11 September 1996, and 11 September 2004, was analyzed. Only those accidents in which NTSB judged that the cause of the accident was suicide were included in the final analysis. The relative risk (RR) of the pilot AASs in all fatal accidents in the U.S. was calculated in order to compare the one, two, and three-year periods after the September 11 terrorist attacks with five years preceding the event. The RR of a fatal general aviation aircraft accident being due to pilot suicide was 3.68-fold (95% confidence interval 1.04–12.98) during the first year after 11 September 2001, but there was not a statistically significant increase in the later years.

The field of aviation provides a unique opportunity to investigate how perception, action and cognition interact in complex yet controlled ecologically valid environments. We suggest a novel cross-domain approach that combines insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition with a neurophysiological framework to explain patterns of human performance across a variety of aviation contexts. Specifically, we argue that studying the interaction between an agent and the environment, as manifest in the Mirror Neuron system as a neural correlate, is key to understanding complex behavior. We can describe the experience and skills involved with task-relevant actions – like flying an airplane – using brain mechanisms of motor simulation of the observed action. With this direct coupling between perception and action, the automatic implicit nature of the Mirror Neuron system can be harnessed to improve human factor and ergonomics. This analysis offers three areas for future study and application: (1) enhancing flight training by isolating specific agent-environment relations; (2) tracking training progression based on brain signatures of flight expertise; and (3) neuroscientific-inspired ecological design of next-generation human–machine interfaces in flight decks. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The efforts should be directed towards the pursuit of “zero accidents”, providing aircrews with the necessary resources to minimize risks. One of the most important flight operation resources used in aviation is the checklist. However, when faced with an emergency, the crew cannot always make use of them, either because the huge diversity of potential emergencies does not allow to collect all of them in these manuals, or because the time available to react is so short that it makes it impossible to utilize them. This paper shows how aircraft checklists are a necessary but insufficient tool to solve complex, unpredictable, and novel emergencies. Furthermore, based on successfully solved critical events, the authors suggest the implementation of specific techniques for the learning and development of problem-solving programs focused on innovation and divergent thinking to decision making, as part of flight training, in order to increase the crews’ capability to face such emergencies. © 2018 The Author(s)."

With system approach in management and strategy, human risk factor as input has considerable potential to change results as airworthiness in aviation management. The managers of aviation business also optimize their functions to act safe while making contribution to development in triple of sustainability as economic development and its sustainability; social development and its sustainability; and environmental development and its sustainability. Corporate sustainability can be accomplished via supporting workforce which is the human risk factor. To support (empowerment) workforce, researchers should identify human risk or error factors which are important to this research. The purpose of this study is to suggest holistic framework for working environment system of aircraft maintenance technicians (AMTs) within two respects such as human performance (ergonomics) and corporate performance (sustainability). The secondary purpose of this system is to develop human risk taxonomy by determining the factors affecting both human and work by taking ergonomic aspects in aviation. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a taxonomy of human risk factors for AMTs is developed. These human factors divided into groups and subfactors are obtained from an extensive literature review and experts’ opinions in the field of human performance in aviation. Taxonomy developed will be useful to both sharing and using corporate sources in sustainable way. Findings: Human risk factors can be considered or accepted as factors that cause human error. This may result in the optimum way to managing human risk factor via minimizing human-based error. Personality, hazardous attitudes, individual characteristics, physical/psychological condition of AMTs and corporate social responsibility factors are human-related risk variables in this study. The risks and error can be reduced by recognizing these factors and revealing their relation to ergonomic design. Originality/value: The results of this study are intended to constitute a guide for managers to manage risk factors and to take corrective and preventive actions for their maintenance operations. It is believed that this study is highly important for the aviation sector in terms of raising awareness or providing awareness for similar practices. As taxonomy of the risk factors contributes to the managing human error, corrective actions related to these factors must be taken by managers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Background: Pilots are regulated to refrain from duty when their mental or physical state could endanger safety. Still, the human factor is the greatest contributor to aviation accidents, and mishaps are attributed to human unfitness (physical or mental state of the operator), suggesting that pilots might engage in presenteeism. Presenteeism and its consequences have been studied across several occupational groups, but until now pilots have been neglected. Method: Data were collected using an online self-report questionnaire (N = 1,133) consisting of items investigating presenteeism, mental health, and self-reported error rates. Results: Results demonstrated that 63% of the pilots exhibited acts of inappropriate presenteeism in the past year. Inappropriate presentee pilots and pilots with poor recovery in terms of feelings of rest, physical and mental tiredness, and work-related worry, were also more likely to report committing 5 or more errors when on flight duty in the past 12 months. This relationship was not mediated by mental health, as shown in previous research. Conclusion: This study indicates that pilots operate in states that could jeopardize flight safety and that current regulations might be insufficient to ensure safe flight operations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

We then summarize the different uses of eye tracking in each category and highlight metrics which turned out to be useful in each area. Our review is complementary to that of Ziv  (2016). Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose useful application areas for the measurement of eye tracking. Eye tracking has the potential to be effective in terms of preventing errors or injuries by detecting, for example, fatigue or performance decrements. Applied in an appropriate manner in simulated or real flight it can help to ensure optimal functioning of man–machine systems. Conclusion: Further aviation psychology and aerospace medicine research will benefit from measurement of eye movements. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

"Behavior and attitudes among European neurosurgeons – An international survey","2018","Journal of Clinical Neuroscience","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049909150&partnerID=40&md5=35a704ef1ca4a9035d60bce612f7f52d","Background: A recent survey showed that potentially hazardous levels of certain attitudes have been associated with worse patient outcomes in orthopedic surgery, based on a questionnaire that was adopted from aviation. This questionnaire aims to evaluate the prevalence of potentially hazardous levels of machismo, impulsiveness, anxiety, antiauthority, resignation, and invulnerability in attitudes and was adopted for use among neurosurgeons. Methods: All individual members of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) were invited to fill-out an online questionnaire. Questions were on a five-point Likert-scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree with five questions per attitude and answers were collected together with neurosurgeon and practice characteristics. Participants could score five points for each question after which an overall score was calculated for each attitude. Like the orthopedic survey, a potentially hazardous level of any behavior was defined as a score >20. Results: Resignation (n = 21; 7.7%) and anxiety (n = 10; 3.7%) had the highest prevalence of potentially hazardous levels among neurosurgeons. Few neurosurgeons showed potentially hazardous levels of antiauthority (n = 4; 1.5%), self-confidence (n = 2; 0.7%), or impulsive attitudes (n = 1; 0.4%). None of the participants showed potentially hazardous levels of machismo. Overall, 12.2% of neurosurgeons had a potentially hazardous score for at least one of the evaluated attitudes. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate a low prevalence of potentially hazardous levels of certain attitudes among neurosurgeons based on a questionnaire tailored to neurosurgery. However, the implications of this study are limited by various factors and warrant further evaluation and warrant further evaluation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
"Training Pilots for Unexpected Events: A Simulator Study on the Advantage of Unpredictable and Variable Scenarios","2018","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048988384&partnerID=40&md5=128fea31684d33be98edc90c7699990c","Objective: This study tested whether simulator-based training of pilot responses to unexpected or novel events can be improved by including unpredictability and variability in training scenarios. Background: Current regulations allow for highly predictable and invariable training, which may not be sufficient to prepare pilots for unexpected or novel situations in-flight. Training for surprise will become mandatory in the near future. Method: Using an aircraft model largely unfamiliar to the participants, one group of 10 pilots (the unpredictable and variable [U/V] group) practiced responses to controllability issues in a relatively U/V manner. A control group of another 10 pilots practiced the same failures in a highly predictable and invariable manner. After the practice, performance of all pilots was tested in a surprise scenario, in which the pilots had to apply the learned knowledge. To control for surprise habituation and familiarization with the controls, two control tests were included. Results: Whereas the U/V group required more time than the control group to identify failures during the practice, the results indicated superior understanding and performance in the U/V group as compared to the control group in the surprise test. There were no significant differences between the groups in surprise or performance in the control tests. Conclusion: Given the results, we conclude that organizing pilot training in a more U/V way improves transfer of training to unexpected situations in-flight. Application: The outcomes suggest that the inclusion of U/V simulator training scenarios is important when training pilots for unexpected situations. © 2018, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

CHMI2 represents a new approach to aviation human factors engineering that introduces adaptive functionalities in the design of operators’ command, control and display functions. A CHMI2 system assesses human cognitive states based on measurement of key psycho-physiological observables. The cognitive states are used to predict and enhance operator performance in the accomplishment of aviation tasks, with the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall human-machine teaming. The CHMI2 system presented in this paper employs a four-layer architecture comprising sensing, extraction, classification and adaptation functionalities. An overview of each layer is provided along with the layer’s metrics, algorithms and functions. Two relevant case studies are presented to illustrate the interactions between the different layers, and the conceptual design of the associated display formats is described. The results indicate that specific eye tracking variables provide discrimination between different modes of control. Furthermore, results indicate that the higher levels of automation supported by the CHMI2 are beneficial in Separation Assurance and Collision Avoidance (SA&CA) scenarios involving low-detectability obstacles and stringent time constraints to implement recovery manoeuvres. These preliminary results highlight that the introduction of CHMI2 functionalities in future UAS can significantly reduce reaction time and enhance operational effectiveness of unmanned aircraft response to collision and loss of separation events, as well as improve the overall safety and efficiency of operations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Current research has suggested potential health risks posed by energy drink consumption. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of energy drink consumption and beliefs about nutritional supplements in a U.S. military population. METHODS: Data were collected by means of an anonymous 44-item survey that was administered to and completed by 302 naval aviation candidates (100% response rate) enrolled in aviation preflight indoctrination (API) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL. RESULTS: Bivariate correlations indicated a statistically significant relationship between beliefs regarding the safety of energy drinks, energy drink consumption frequency, and personal beliefs regarding supplements [r(202) = -0.23]. The negative correlational coefficient indicated an inverse relationship between favorable perceptions on supplements and energy drink consumption. DISCUSSION: This study assessed beliefs about the safety of nutritional supplements among API candidates and to examine if a relationship between nutritional supplement beliefs and energy drink consumption exists. Results indicated a significant inverse relationship between API candidates' beliefs regarding consumption frequency and safety of energy drinks as well as beliefs regarding supplement use. Results also suggested that the more positively an API candidate perceived nutritional supplements, the less frequently energy drinks were consumed. The findings of this study indicated a weak inverse relationship between the beliefs/use of energy drinks and beliefs regarding the effectiveness of nutritional supplement use among naval aviation candidates. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

One of the causes of the accident mentioned by official agencies were the mistakes made by the pilots, which combined with technical failures led to the loss of control of the plane. Human error was again appointed as the last link in the chain of events leading to the accident and, therefore, as its immediate cause. In this paper it is proposed an alternative explanation, which is not limited to the identification of mistakes made by the crew but proposes an explanation of mistakes. In a cognitive analysis of accidents based on the concept of action and situated cognition, the error is not the point of arrival of the diagnosis of the causes of an accident, but it is its starting point. Like this, resumed the official results of the accident, the specific reference to the expected behavior of pilots in relation to evolving unforeseen and breach of aviation rules during the four minutes leading up to the fall of the aircraft in the ocean. This critical analysis makes room for a more comprehensive explanation of the pilots behavior, based on another frame of reference - the cognitive analysis of accidents - not yet incorporated in the official models of analysis of human factors in safety, and allows to speculate on other actions for prevention. © 2018 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

It provides a systemic approach to manage safety, develop or evaluate an aviation organizational structure, establish accountability systems, guiding policies and working procedures. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) demands from all aviation industries to implement SMS with the same level of priority that other core processes are managed. Present research was focused on reviewing critical principles, practices and application of SMS framework and how to eradicate human errors in aircraft maintenance through identification of hazards and launch of a risk management process. Implementation SMS in aviation organization was also investigated to establish the limitations as well as advantages gained in terms of outcomes of its implementation. Data from failed quality reports for various inspections during a specific period were collected for that organization. Analysis showed that most of the human errors committed during maintenance were personality based due to poor work ethics followed by training based errors. Personality and work ethics based errors were found to have 72.3% contribution to total errors. It was followed by Training based errors at 15.76% whereas, Organizational factors contributed to 11.92% of the total errors. After this, risk factor analysis was also carried out which showed that 8.83% errors fell in the Intolerable severity level, Tolerable region had a total of 56.73% and remaining 34.41% were part of the Acceptable errors category. As a result of this analysis a risk mitigation strategy was proposed for the organization under study.

In such settings, a missed alarm can have disastrous consequences. It is conventional wisdom that for alarms to be heard, ""louder is better,"" so that alarm levels in operational environments routinely exceed ambient noise levels. Through a robust experimental paradigm in an anechoic environment to study human response to audible alerting stimuli in a cognitively demanding setting, akin to high-tempo and high-risk domains, clinician participants responded to patient crises while concurrently completing an auditory speech intelligibility and visual vigilance distracting task as the level of alarms were varied as a signal-to-noise ratio above and below hospital background noise. There was little difference in performance on the primary task when the alarm sound was -11 dB below background noise as compared with +4 dB above background noise - a typical real-world situation. Concurrent presentation of the secondary auditory speech intelligibility task significantly degraded performance. Operator performance can be maintained with alarms that are softer than background noise. These findings have widespread implications for the design and implementation of alarms across all high-consequence settings. © 2018 Acoustical Society of America."

In this part, the sensory illusion simulator used for the experiment is mentioned. In the second part we describe the simulator and test flight. In the third part we discuss data retrieved during simulator flights that are important for explaining the Giant Hand illusion. CASE REPORT: A well-trained pilot experienced the Giant Hand illusion while executing instrument flight rules flight on a simulator. The Giant Hand illusion was detected from the simulation data and confirmed by the pilot afterward. DISCUSSION: The Giant Hand illusion is a rare type of sensory illusion. The pilot falsely evaluated the situation as a malfunction of the aircraft controls. If the pilot had not been informed by the operator that he might have been influenced by the illusion, he would probably have crashed the simulated aircraft. An unrecognized Giant Hand illusion during a flight can lead to fatal consequences.

There were more negative attitudes of death and dying among student skydivers compared with more experienced skydivers. It was also found that expert skydivers had more negative attitudes toward death and dying on some of the measures compared with the intermediate level experienced skydivers. It may be the case that factors such as perceived personal control, overconfidence, and metacognition may be related to these observed differences between the two more experienced groups of skydivers. The possibility of the factors playing a role in skydivers’ attitudes toward death and dying should be taken into consideration in the training programs for skydiving. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015."

Emotion was manipulated by a social stressor and cognitive workload with the difficulty of a secondary task. Our results confirmed the sensitivity of the HR to cognitive demand and training effects, with increased HR when the task was more difficult and decreased HR with training (time-on-task). Training was also associated with an increased HRV, with increased values along the flight scenario time course.

The scale purports to measure overall workload as a single variable calculated by summing responses to six items. Since no data address the validity of this scoring approach in health care, we evaluated the single factor structure of the NASA-TLX as a measure of overall workload among intenisive care nurses. Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis of data from two studies of nurse workload in neonatal, paediatric, and adult intensive care units. Study 1 data were obtained from 136 nurses in one neonatal intensive care unit. Study 2 data were collected from 300 nurses in 17 adult, paediatric and neonatal units. Nurses rated their workload using the NASA-TLX's paper version. Results: A single factor model testing whether all six items measured a single overall workload variable fit least well (RMSEA = 0.14; CFI = 0.91; TLI = 0.85). A second model that specified two items as outcomes of overall workload had acceptable fit (RMSEA = 0.08; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.95) while a third model of four items fit best (RMSEA = 0.06; CFI > 0.99; TLI = 0.99).

However, the acceptability and usability of the PAB has not been well established in units that regularly do airborne exercises. Many anecdotal concerns in the past may be limiting common use. The purpose of the study is to ascertain the attitudes toward the PAB among experienced paratroopers. Methods One hundred experienced paratroopers training to be jumpmasters at the Advanced Airborne School (Fort Bragg, NC) voluntarily responded to a 13-item, paper questionnaire to assess attitudes toward the PAB, its use, and concerns about future ankle injuries. The survey was offered to all 100 students enrolled in an Advanced Airborne School course. Results were input into an online database using Qualtrics and qualitative responses were evaluated for thematic content and categorized appropriately. Analysis was performed using Qualtrics and SPSS for descriptive statistics, two-sample t-tests, and chi-square tests. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate Likert-type responses. Results Of the 100 paratroopers who responded to the survey 32% had over 10 yr of military service, 58% had over 5 yr of service, and 32% had over 5 yr on active jump status. Results show that none of the respondents had ever used the PAB; 62% had never heard of the PAB, and 72% had never observed use of the PAB. A majority of respondents (87%) had never injured an ankle during a parachute landing fall (PLF), but 79% believed that an ankle injury could affect their career potential as a paratrooper. Almost one-half of the respondents (47%) had seen that ankle injuries affect another paratrooper's career. A third of the respondents (35%) said that they had concerns that would keep them from using the PAB, whereas 21% were uncertain, as they had never heard of it. Only 19% of the respondents were willing to use measures such as taping, lace-up bracing, semi-rigid brace inside a normal boot, specialized jump boot with stabilizing braces built in, or outside-the-boot braces to prevent ankle injury. However, 40% said that they were likely to use these measures on jumps after experiencing an ankle injury. Discussion Previous research clearly establishes the advantages of the PAB. None of the participants had ever used the PAB but expressed a fear about how an ankle injury might impact their future career potential. Yet half of the jumpmasters indicated a willingness to use prophylactic measures after an ankle injury. Conclusion This survey assessed the attitude and knowledge related to the PAB among jumpmaster students. Results show that despite the benefits of the PAB, a negative attitude exists toward the PAB, and it is not currently being used. This survey clearly demonstrates the need either to educate paratroopers on the existence of the PAB or to explore other designs that may be more readily accepted in the airborne community. © Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2018.

They occur by a discordance by the peripheral systems about the information captured and generally, resulting in pilots failure to recognize key signals. The aim of this study is to review the state of the art of spatial disorientation and optical illusions in aviation pilots. This kind of disorientation has important practical consequences, because a remarkable percentage of plane accidents are related to pilot’s optical illusions. An exhaustive review using pubmed and semantic scholar databases was conducted to find out the most frequent optical illusions in aviation pilots. A total of 45 full text articles published English or Spanish were reviewed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to review exhaustively and describe the main factors involved in spatial disorientation and optical illusions affecting aviation pilots. Mainly, contextual factors: width of landing track lights, nocturnal operations or low visibility, inclination of the landing track, decline of the ground, size of habitual references, low level approach on the water, black hole, sky/terrain confusion, distortion by climatic factors, autokinesis or autocinetics, optional investment illusion, illusions by vection, false horizon, rain on the windshield, misalignment in the approach, vibrations, somatogravic illusion, coriolis illusion and “G” forces. In a lesser extent, human factors and pathologies of the visual systems involved in spatial disorientation and associated optical illusions affecting aviation pilots are also described. Discussion. Practical implications are further discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

This study investigates how the difficulty of such tasks influences emotional states, cognitive workload and task performance. We use quantitative and qualitative measurements, including the recording of pupil dilation and changes in affect using questionnaires. Participants were required to perform a number of air traffic control tasks using the immersive human accessible Virtual Reality space in the “eXperience Induction Machine”. Based on the data collected, we developed and validated a model which integrates personality, workload and affective theories. Our results indicate that the difficulty of an air traffic control task has a direct influence on cognitive workload as well as on the self-reported mood; whereas both mood and workload seem to change independently. In addition, we show that personality, in particular neuroticism, affects both mood and performance of the participants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
"Assessment of sleepiness, fatigue, and depression among Gulf Cooperation Council commercial airline pilots","2018","Sleep and Breathing","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028998919&partnerID=40&md5=b3ce3a988fa6f3de74e83481c011f8ab","Purpose: No studies have assessed the prevalence of fatigue, depression, sleepiness, and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among commercial airlines pilots in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Methods: This was a quantitative cross­sectional study conducted among pilots who were on active duty and had flown during the past 6 months for one of three commercial airline companies. We included participants with age between 20 and 65 years. Data were collected using a predesigned electronic questionnaire composed of questions related to demographic information in addition to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Berlin Questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: The study included 328 pilots with a mean age ± standard deviation of 41.4 ± 9.7 years. Overall, 224 (68.3%) pilots had an FSS score ≥ 36 indicating severe fatigue and 221 (67.4%) reported making mistakes in the cockpit because of fatigue. One hundred and twelve (34.1%) pilots had an ESS score ≥ 10 indicating excessive daytime sleepiness and 148 (45.1%) reported falling asleep at the controls at least once without previously agreeing with their colleagues. One hundred and thirteen (34.5%) pilots had an abnormal HADS depression score (≥ 8), and 96 (29.3%) pilots were at high risk for OSA requiring further assessment. Conclusion: Fatigue, sleepiness, risk of OSA, and depression are prevalent among GCC commercial airline pilots. Regular assessment by aviation authorities is needed to detect and treat these medical problems. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."

Over a dozen cases of inflight transmission of serious infections have been documented, and air travel can serve as a conduit for the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and pandemics. Despite sensational media stories and anecdotes, the risks of transmission of respiratory viruses in an airplane cabin are unknown. Movements of passengers and crew may facilitate disease transmission. On 10 transcontinental US flights, we chronicled behaviors and movements of individuals in the economy cabin on single-aisle aircraft. We simulated transmission during flight based on these data. Our results indicate there is low probability of direct transmission to passengers not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger. This data-driven, dynamic network transmission model of droplet-mediated respiratory disease is unique. To measure the true pathogen burden, our team collected 229 environmental samples during the flights. Although eight flights were during Influenza season, all qPCR assays for 18 common respiratory viruses were negative. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All right reserved."

However, there have been few systematic reviews investigating the topic of mental health in commercial aviation. This systematic review aims to identify the types and prevalence of mental health disorders that commercial airline pilots experience with a focus on mood disorders and suicide risk. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Eligible studies were assessed and data was extracted and analyzed. Results: 20 studies were identified. The prevalence of depression experienced by commercial airline pilots in this review ranged from 1.9% to 12.6%. Factors that negatively impacted the mental health of pilots included substance abuse, experiencing verbal or sexual abuse, disruption in sleep circadian rhythms and fatigue. Discussion: This systematic review identifies that commercial airline pilots may experience depression at least as frequently as the general population. Commercial airline pilots experience occupational stressors, such as disrupted circadian rhythms and fatigue which may increase risks of developing mood disorders. Most studies identified in this review were cross-sectional in nature with substantial limitations. There is a clear need for further higher quality longitudinal studies to better understand the mental health of commercial airline pilots. © 2018 Pasha and Stokes."
"Copycats in pilot aircraft-assisted suicides after the germanwings incident","2018","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044085872&partnerID=40&md5=3ecd4b57402d8f9c1d2e028238630dc2","Aircraft-assisted pilot suicide is a rare but serious phenomenon. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in pilot aircraft-assisted suicide risks, i.e., a copycat effect, in the U.S. and Germany after the Germanwings 2015 incident in the French Alps. Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides were searched in the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident investigation database and in the German Bundestelle für Flugunfalluntersuchung (BFU) Reports of Investigation database five years before and two years after the deliberate crash of the Germanwings flight into the French Alps in 2015. The relative risk (RR) of the aircraft-assisted pilot suicides was calculated. Two years after the incident, three out of 454 (0.66%) fatal incidents were aircraft-assisted suicides compared with six out of 1292 (0.46%) in the prior five years in the NTSB database. There were no aircraft-assisted pilot suicides in the German database during the two years after or five years prior to the Germanwings crash. The relative aircraft-assisted pilot suicide risk for the U.S. was 1.4 (95% CI 0.3–4.2) which was not statistically significant. Six of the pilots who died by suicide had told someone of their suicidal intentions. We consider changes in the rate to be within a normal variation. Responsible media coverage of aircraft incidents is important due to the large amount of publicity that these events attract. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Little is known regarding EC use among different military demographic groups or the extent of influence that social determinants of health may have on the behavior. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of EC use in a select population of active duty U.S. Naval personnel. This study is unique in that it allows for EC behavior comparison between a traditionally healthy demographic (aviators, a subset of aircrew) and a representative general military population sample. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected anonymously and analyzed in 2015-2016. Active duty Naval personnel (n = 977) were asked about ever trying ECs, frequency of use, and when was the last time an EC was used. Participants were assessed similarly regarding cigarette use. Descriptive and inferential statistics as well as multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted using categorical and ordinal variables assigned to usage and demographic factors. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Naval Hospital Portsmouth located in Portsmouth, Virginia. Results: Within the study population, 31.4% have tried ECs, 9.3% were current users, and only 3.8% were dual (EC and cigarettes) users. EC use was significantly associated with paygrade (enlisted), primary job duty (non-aircrew), and education (less than a bachelor degree, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively). ECs were used at some point as a smoking cessation tool for 43.6% of current EC users (p < 0.001), 21.6% of current smokers, and only 5.6% of former smokers. Continued EC use after ever trying ECs (30.0%) was only slightly more prevalent as continued cigarette use after ever trying cigarettes (27.3%). Smokers were nearly five times more likely to currently use ECs compared with non-smokers. Trying cigarettes was associated with nearly 12 times the risk for trying ECs compared with those who never tried cigarettes. No significant misuse of ECs was noted; however, several cases of drinking, tasting, and touching EC fluid were reported. Conclusion: This study is unique in that it examines the use of electronic cigarettes among selected healthy and baseline groups within the active duty U.S. Navy population. The current prevalence of EC use among active duty personnel is much higher than previously thought. Continued use of ECs after ever trying them appears to exceed that of cigarettes even among healthy populations such as aircrew. The findings of increased risk of EC use among those with lower income and less than a bachelor's degree suggest social determinants of health implications. This study sheds new light on EC use, characteristics of use, addiction implications, and highlights concerns for a growing health risk behavior. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2018.

As part of this effort, U.S. service members deployed to West Africa to support a spectrum of activities that did not involve direct patient care. Although previous studies identified the psychological impact of responding to an outbreak, these studies were limited to retrospective data, small sample sizes, and medical personnel. The goals of the present study were to (a) document the mental health and well-being of troops deploying in response to an infectious disease outbreak; (b) identify their stressors, attitudes toward deployment, and health risk concerns; and (c) understand the role of combat experience in adjusting to these types of missions. Materials and Methods: Study participants at both pre- and during deployment were active duty U.S. soldiers in a combat aviation battalion from a large U.S. military installation. U.S. soldiers were surveyed (n = 251) 3 wk before deploying to Liberia (October 2014) and surveyed again during their deployment (February 2015; n = 173). Participants were primarily male (86.1%), junior ranking (56.0%), and just over half had previous combat deployment experience (51.2%). Surveys were anonymous and not linked to one another over time. Results: Overall rates of mental health problems were low (2.4% at pre-deployment and 5.8% during deployment), whereas sleep problems were reported by 4.9% at pre-deployment and 12% during deployment. At pre-deployment, top stressors focused on health threats; fewer stressors were reported during deployment. Soldiers were relatively less concerned about contracting Ebola than other more prevalent diseases. Soldiers with combat experience reported more somatic and sleep problems at pre-deployment than those without previous combat experience. There were no significant differences during deployment between those with and without previous combat experience. Conclusion: Overall, a small proportion of respondents reported significant rates of mental health problems. In contrast, sleep problems were reported by 12% during deployment. In terms of attitudes toward the mission, the vast majority reported that they knew what to do to protect themselves from disease and that they understood the potential risk involved. The study also confirmed previous findings that soldiers with previous combat experience had more somatic symptoms at pre-deployment than those without, although this distinction appeared limited to the pre-deployment phase. Results can be used to address anxiety by personnel during pre-deployment and to inform leadership preparing personnel to deploy in response to future infectious disease outbreaks. © 2017 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2017.

The purpose of this study is to identify factors that affect airline pilot fatigue. This study proposes a fatigue model for airline pilots. Fatigue is classified into physical decline, mental decline, and rest defects. Based on 929 responses from pilots, this study verifies that pilot fatigue is affected by seven independent variables – flight direction, crew scheduling, partnership, aircraft environment, job assignment, ethnic difference, and hotel environment. Results show these factors affect physical fatigue, mental decline, and rest defects. These findings can contribute to reducing pilot fatigue, which is important in aviation in terms of physical fatigue, mental decline, and rest defects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods Feasibility related to the process items recruitment, reach, context, dose delivered (training time and content); dose received (participants’ engagement); satisfaction with training; intermediate outcomes (skills, confidence and behaviors); and barriers and facilitators of the training intervention were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods. Results Implementation proved successful regarding dose delivered, dose received and satisfaction. Confidence among participants in the training program in using and talking about devices, observed use of devices among colleagues, and internal feedback on work behavior increased significantly (p<0.01). Main facilitators were self-efficacy, motivation, and perceived utility of training among the trainees. Barriers included lack of peer support, opportunities to observe and practice behaviors, and follow-up activities; as well as staff reduction and job insecurity. Conclusions In identifying important barriers and facilitators for a successful outcome, this study can help supporting the effectiveness of future interventions. Our results suggest that barriers caused by organizational changes may likely be alleviated by recruiting motivated trainees and securing strong organizational support for the implementation. © 2018 Bergsten et al.

Proponents of automated driving (AD) are enthusiastic about its promise to transform mobility and realize impressive societal benefits. This paper is an attempt to carefully examine the potential of AD to realize safety benefits, to challenge widely-held assumptions and to delve more deeply into the barriers that are hitherto largely overlooked. As automated vehicle (AV) technologies advance and emerge within a ubiquitous cyber-physical world they raise additional issues that have not yet been adequately defined, let alone researched. Issues around automation, sociotechnical complexity and systems resilience are well known in the context of aviation and space. There are important lessons that could be drawn from these applications to help inform the development of automated driving. This paper argues that for the foreseeable future, regardless of the level of automation, a driver will continue to have a role. It seems clear that the benefits of automated driving, safety and otherwise, will accrue only if these technologies are designed in accordance with sound cybernetics principles, promote effective human-systems integration and gain the trust by operators and the public. © 2017"

It was found that self-perceived poor performance was associated with job-related factors such as fatigue and anxiety about required courses, performance checks, and insufficient flying time, particularly among older pilots. Job dissatisfaction was predicted by lack of career opportunities, poor organizational climate and morale, and lack of autonomy at work, together with some domestic stressors (e.g., family health). Overall mental ill-health was found to be associated with lack of autonomy at work, fatigue, and flying patterns, together with an inability to relax and a lack of social support. © Cary L.

This chapter outlines pilot selection process and focuses on the aim and purpose of mental health assessment in pilot selection, with a main emphasis on selecting new candidates and also for promotions. Most aviation authorities require pilots to be free from specific mental disorders both at the time of their initial medical assessment throughout their flying career. There are various ways to collect data on pilot mental health, and these are often used in combination at various stages of the assessment.

This chapter reviews the utility, reliability and validity of neurocognitive testing and make recommendations for the future. There are two main contexts in aviation in which neurocognitive assessments may be undertaken: as part of the competitive selection process for pilots or because a potential neurological/health problem is suspected. For safety reasons it is important to identify pilots who are cognitively impaired, and a particularly effective method of doing so is neuropsychological assessment. This type of specialist neurocognitive testing differs from online testing in several important ways. Clinical neuropsychologists evaluate individuals using a variety of means, one of which is neurocognitive testing.

Personality problems and disorders have been linked historically to unsafe acts in aviation, and on occasion, these have been catastrophic resulting in the loss of life. In the field of mental health, personality problems that are of a magnitude to impair everyday functioning are deemed to be symptomatic of personality disorder.

Personality characteristics are based on the comparison of an individual to a suitable representative sample; this allows for comparisons to be made between individuals in relations to the different characteristics. The gap in airline pilot selection came to many as an alarming surprise, with many press reports highlighting the failure of the aviation industry and regulators to regulate some form of psychological screening. The Second World War led to the demand for a high number of pilots, and high training attrition rate led to the re-visiting of the work conducted by the psychologists of the First World War.

Regional growth, such as in Asia and the Middle East, may fuel occupational mobility among pilots and draw pilots away from their home country, thereby creating shortages in some regions and countries. Pilots are increasingly selected not only for their flying ability but also for how they fit within an organization or company. Their ability to work within the culture of the organization is valued as highly as their flying record and piloting potential or skills. Mental health and stability, personality and cognitive performance are increasingly relevant in the pilot assessment and recruitment process.

The DLR Aviation and Space Psychology unit is one of the leading competence centers in the selection of operational aviation personnel, examining between 5, 000 and 13, 000 cases per year. Target-oriented selection of prospective cockpit personnel is the first important premise in meeting the safety criteria of airlines and aviation authorities while ensuring that successful candidates fit well into the organization’s culture. DLR’s department of Aviation and Space Psychology had elaborated an interactive domain in 1994 with contemporary factors drawing on crew resource management processes. A job analysis involving 141 airline pilots representing different cockpit roles and aircraft types was conducted in 1997 by DLR with this extended Fleishman Job Analysis Survey. The non-technical skills system was co-developed by DLR and consists of the four categories cooperation, leadership and managerial skills, situation awareness and decision making. © 2020 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

From pilot selection in general, and the use of personality in the selection process, has played an important role in the aviation industry. The compelling arguments of consequence and cost, i.e. safety and return on investment in pilot training, have driven the effort to develop methods that can identify candidates with desired personality traits or at least avoid those with undesired traits. In spite of the automation and proceduralisation of work in the cockpit in it is the action of the pilot that makes the difference between a safe and an unsafe flight. Culture may be seen as a challenge in regards to flight operations, where diversity could be difficult for cooperation in the cockpit.

The ethical frameworks in particular are designed to work together with the practice guidelines using life-long career learning, professional practice, and supportive mentoring. Bringing universalized ethical approach to the area of pilot selection, the more rigid rule-based approach where there is a precise defined process that becomes potentially fixated and stuck, the shallower vision of decision-making can lead to substantial harm. One of the key ethical aspects in the psychometric and psychological assessment for pilot selection is to ensure fair and just treatment for the person undergoing the selection process, while properly weighing up the responsibilities and pressures that that he or she will be able to realistically manage. © 2020 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Somerville’s conceptualization of the pilot as an ‘Energy Manager’ exemplifies the art of the experienced instructor in taking a complex matter and reducing it to clear fundamentals on which the learner can build by elaboration. The distinction between judgement, airmanship, decision-making and problem-solving is a controversy which has caused confusion, verbosity, circumlocution and considerable pain. One point of agreement, however, is that each is vital for aviation safety and pilot training. A systematic approach to do so is the flow-chart model developed by R. O. Besco who provides a five-dimensional professional performance analysis for analyzing and precribing remedies to reduce pilot error and improve operations.

There is a widely used group of methods to analyze the content of a job and its needed activities. From a human factor point of view a job analysis is the best practice to identify the most difficult, frequent, and important tasks that make up the job as satellite controller. Our attention was focused on the questionnaire of the Fleishman Job Analysis Survey (F-JAS). With the support of DLR´s Aviation and Space Psychology Department, DLR GfR´s Human Resources Department tailored the job profile of spacecraft controllers for the first time by a scientific study to the needs of future satellite operations.

Every day we rely on highly trained specialists to solve complex problems in high-stakes environments, that is, environments involving direct threats to the preservation of human life. While previous work has tended to focus on problem solving in a single domain, this book covers multiple, related domains. It is divided into three parts, the first of which addresses the theoretical foundations, with coverage of theories of instructional design and expertise. Part two covers the five high-stakes domains and offers directions for training in these domains. In turn, part three provides practical guidelines for instructional design in high-stakes professions, including learner analysis, task analysis, assessment and evaluation. The book is intended for a broad readership, including those who operate in high-stress, time-pressure occupations. Trainers at professional organisations can utilise the theoretical frameworks and training strategies discussed in this book when preparing their clients for complex, real-world problem solving.

There was an exhaustion of the labor process of flight crew members (FCM) due to the high intellectual, sensory, emotional loads caused by the elevated responsibility for safety. The assessment of working conditions of the flight crew can be attributed to their class 3.1-3.4 (harmful working conditions). The clinical and audiological picture showed hearing loss in all subjects to be chronic, bilateral, sensorineural type, slowly progressive, without general somatic pathology, which could lead to hearing loss. The excess of the total physical component of the health-related quality of life (HRQL) over the total psychological component was identified in FCM. The values of the mental health and life activity scores of HRQL were found to be lower than in the comparison group. Evaluation of the psychoemotional status of FCM revealed the adaptive type of attitude to the disease, the lack of social frustration and personality traits predisposing to the development of neurosis and reflecting neurotic changes. The further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify identified socio-psychological characteristics of patients and to develop effective measures of psychosocial and medical rehabilitation that improve the HRQL of the FCM affected by the impact of industrial noise. © 2018 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Even though it is being used for health purposes, studies involving eye-tracking are rare in the field of endo-neuro-surgery. This study aims to use this technology to promote our understanding of the effect related to computer-based instructional materials on mental workload of endo-neurosurgery residents. Four computer-based simulation scenarios are developed based on skill develop-ment requirements of endo-neurosurgery residents. Two of them were designed as general models and the other two as simulated surgical models. During these surgery procedures, in real settings, surgical residents need to use their both hands simultaneously to control the endoscope and the operational tool in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, to shed light on the participants' behaviors, these scenarios are performed with dominant-hand, non-dominant hand and, finally with both-hands using haptic interfaces. Twenty-three residents volun-teered in this study. Their eye-movements were recorded while performing the scenarios. According to the results of this study, when performing the simulated surgical models, an increase in the participants' mental workload was recorded when compared to the other scenarios. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the eye-movements of surgical residents can provide insights about the anticipated level of difficulty about the skill-based tasks. This information might be very critical to properly design and organize instructional materials for endo-neurosurgery, and also to better guide and evaluate the progress of trainees in com-puter simulation-based skill training environments. © 2018, International Group for Eye Movement Research."

Research within high-risk industries, such as aviation, shipping, and agriculture, has identified the importance of non-technical skills (NTS) in maintaining effective, safe performance and reducing error and injury. However, there is a lack of research evaluating factors that may contribute to NTS attitudes and behaviors. As a first step to address this literature gap, the current study evaluated a range of individual and environmental factors as potential predictors of attitudes toward NTS in agriculture. Method: A sample of 170 farmers from within the United Kingdomand Ireland were surveyed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of personality, stress, attitudes toward safety (safety climate, motivation, and risk), environmental stressors (workload, work-life imbalance), and non-technical skills (team and lone worker). Results: Attitudes toward safety climate, compliance, and motivation showed a significant association with both team-based and lone worker NTS. Conscientiousness correlated positively with the majority of the NTS elements. Multiple regression analysis indicated neuroticism and conscientiousness demonstrated capacity to predict NTS attitudes. Concerns about costs and equipment, attitudes toward safety climate, and safety motivation were also found to be significant predictors of NTS attitudes. Conclusion: The results indicate the utility of individual characteristics and environmental factors when predicting farming NTS attitudes. As a result, these elements could be important when evaluating engagement with NTS and developing NTS training initiatives in agriculture. © 2017 Taylor & Francis."

This article examines the international dimension of EU agencies by advancing a legal-analytical blueprint linking EU law to international public law. The principle of institutional balance and the Meroni doctrine are used as EU law parameters for assessing the agencies' international cooperation mandate, powers and actions, whilst the concepts of 'international agreement' and 'international legal personality' serve as standards for clarifying the legal nature of EU agencies' international cooperation instruments and their legal status as global actors. Case studies on the European Aviation Safety Agency, Frontex and Europol 'test on the ground' the legal-analytical framework advanced and offer fresh insights into the EU agencies' international cooperation practice. Whilst the institutional balance in EU external relations does not prohibit entrusting certain international cooperation tasks to EU agencies, the application of the Meroni requirements suggests a limited role for these EU bodies as global actors. Next, the international cooperation instruments concluded by EU agencies can be legally binding agreements which, as a specific category of technical-administrative agreements, could still be accommodated within the EU legal framework. Albeit EU agencies could acquire in theory a derived and functionally limited international legal personality, none of the three agencies examined has such a legal status entailing that their international cooperation actions are in principle attributable to the Union. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands."

However, there is limited guidance for radiologists about structuring the working day to strike the necessary balance between achieving satisfactory reporting volume and maintaining quality and safety. We surveyed 86 neuroradiologists (receiving 59 responses), regarding time spent reporting, frequency and duration of work breaks, and break activities. Our results demonstrate that some neuroradiologists report for up to 12 h a day and for 4 h before taking a break. Mean duration of breaks is less than 15 min and these often consist of computer screen-based or cognitively demanding tasks. Many areas of medicine have looked to the aviation industry to develop improvements in safety through regulated, standardised practices. There are parallels between the work of air traffic controllers (ATCs) and radiologists. We review the legislation that controls the working hours of UK ATCs to minimise fatigue-related errors, and its scientific basis. We also consider the vigilance decrement, a concept in cognitive science which describes the reduction in performance with increasing time-on-task. We conclude that, in comparison with ATCs, work patterns among radiologists are poorly standardised and potentially dangerous. Evidence suggests that placing limits on reporting time and minimum break duration, as well as ensuring appropriate break activities, can benefit reporting quality. It is imperative that radiologists and managers heed these lessons, to improve standards and protect patients from error. © 2018 British Institute of Radiology. All rights reserved."

Screening tools for mental health risks in airline pilots are needed. There is growing interest in pilot peer-support programs and how to incorporate them in a just culture, meaning that pilots can report mental health complaints without a risk of job or income loss. We combined findings from aviation accidents and incidents with a search of scientific literature to provide data-based recommendations for screening, peer-support, and a just culture approach to mental health problems. METHODS: Commercial aviation accidents and incidents in which a mental disorder of a pilot was thought to play a role were reviewed. Subsequently, PubMed and PsychInfo literature searches were performed on peer-support programs, just culture human resource management, and the risk of negative life events on developing suicidal ideation and behavior in comparable professional groups. RESULTS: Lethal accidents were mostly related to impaired coping with negative life events. Negative life events are clearly related to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completed suicide. A protective effect of peer-support programs on mental health problems has not been established, although peer-support programs are generally appreciated by those involved. We did not find relevant literature on just culture. DISCUSSION: Negative life events are likely a useful screening tool for mental health risks. There is still a lack of evidence on how peer-support groups should be designed and how management of mental health risks can be implemented in a just culture. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

However, it is unknown whether centralization respects patients’ preferences regarding treatment location. This study's objective was to determine how patients balance survival benefit against the burdens of travel to a distant treatment center. Methods Patients presenting for evaluation of adnexal masses completed two discrete choice experiments (DCEs) assessing 1) the 5-year survival benefit required to justify 50 miles of additional travel, and 2) the additional distance patients would travel for a 6% 5-year survival benefit. Demographic data were collected with measures of health numeracy, social support, and comfort with travel. t-Tests were performed to test for significant differences between group means. Results 81% (50/62) of participants required a 5-year survival benefit of ≤ 6% to justify 50 miles of additional travel (DCE#1). These participants were less likely to be employed (56% vs 83%, p = 0.05) and more likely to rate their health as good to excellent (86% vs 50%, p = 0.04) than those requiring > 6% benefit to travel 50 miles. 80% (44/55) of participants would travel ≥ 50 miles for a set 5-year survival benefit of 6% (DCE#2). No association was identified in DCE#2 between willingness to travel and collected sociodemographic covariates. Conclusions 1 in 5 patients with ovarian cancer may prefer not to travel to a referral center, even when aware of the survival benefits of doing so. Policymakers should consider patients’ travel preferences in designing referral structures for care. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Methods A total of 35 experts including test pilots and aircraft design engineers were interviewed on the issues of the mental ability of aged test pilots through completing a questionnaire about the issue. A battery of mental ability test and 16PF were used to examine 37 test pilots who were divided into three age groups (age above 45 year, n = 16) and control group (age below 45 year, n = 21). Results Most important mental attributes of older test pilots were related to professional spirits, flying expertise (judgment) and personality. The firstly aging abilities were cognition and psychomotor ones. Scores of Detecting special graph, Distinguishing direction and Distracted listening were lower than those of control group (P < 0.05), which were negatively correlated to age (r = −0.335, −0.411, −0.409, P < 0.05). Conclusion Mental abilities related to reaction speed decline earlier. Although the expertise may compensate for the decline, routine aptitude test will benefit the increasing need for test pilot and aviation safety. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018."

A model of aerospace neuropsychology is proposed in order to investigate the interaction between psychological variables and neurocognitive errors in the 100 most fatal civil aviation accidents. Recurring psychological and cognitive themes described in the accidents were subjected to multidimensional scaling. Five conceptual clusters pertaining to individual pilot characteristics, sociotechnical cockpit performance, organizational/operational effect, training-level of involvement and decision making-overestimation, were identified. Psychological and cognitive interaction is apparent throughout the accidents’ human factor space, while individual characteristics are located within a dense area visually separated from sociotechnical and human-machine interaction features.

Eight HALO and eight HAHO jumpers were analyzed. They jumped at 5500 m, HALO jumpers opened the parachute at 500 m and HAHO jumpers at 4300 m of altitude. Before and after the jumps, parameters of muscle strength, cortical arousal, blood creatine kinase (CK) and glucose, blood oxygen saturation, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and specific fine motor skills of an experienced jumper were assessed; during the jump, heart rate (HR), HR variability, and speed were evaluated. HALO and HAHO jumps produced a significant increase in CK, lactate, and RPE, and a decrease in glucose. HAHO decreased cortical arousal, presented a higher sympathetic modulation, and a higher HR during the jump than HALO. HALO and HAHO produced an increase in the physiological, sympathetic modulation and muscle destruction, and a decrease in cortical arousal and a higher blood lactate concentration only in the HAHO jump. Also, somatic and cognitive anxiety correlated with higher strength manifestation and muscle destruction.

Five hundred three members of the T1D Exchange online community (www.myglu.org) completed a 45-question survey about their travel experiences flying long distance. The cohort was stratified by duration of T1D and whether or not participants used continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy and/or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). In the last 5 years, 71% of participants had flown long distance. When asked about their perceived ""fear of flying,"" CSII users (with and without a CGM) reported their primary anxiety was ""losing supplies,"" while non-CSII users described concerns over ""unstable blood glucose (highs and lows)"" (P < 0.05). In addition, 74% of participants reported more hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia while traveling overseas and 9% had avoided international travel altogether because of problems related to diabetes management. Furthermore, 22% of participants had run out of insulin at some point during a trip and 37% reported inadequate attention in current sources of information to the unpredictability of self-management needs while traveling.

"Dealing With Unexpected Events on the Flight Deck: A Conceptual Model of Startle and Surprise","2017","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033479908&partnerID=40&md5=1ff6daf930549eed9c14ed093fbd6bb0","Objective: A conceptual model is proposed in order to explain pilot performance in surprising and startling situations. Background: Today’s debate around loss of control following in-flight events and the implementation of upset prevention and recovery training has highlighted the importance of pilots’ ability to deal with unexpected events. Unexpected events, such as technical malfunctions or automation surprises, potentially induce a “startle factor” that may significantly impair performance. Method: Literature on surprise, startle, resilience, and decision making is reviewed, and findings are combined into a conceptual model. A number of recent flight incident and accident cases are then used to illustrate elements of the model. Results: Pilot perception and actions are conceptualized as being guided by “frames,” or mental knowledge structures that were previously learned. Performance issues in unexpected situations can often be traced back to insufficient adaptation of one’s frame to the situation. It is argued that such sensemaking or reframing processes are especially vulnerable to issues caused by startle or acute stress. Conclusion: Interventions should focus on (a) increasing the supply and quality of pilot frames (e.g., though practicing a variety of situations), (b) increasing pilot reframing skills (e.g., through the use of unpredictability in training scenarios), and (c) improving pilot metacognitive skills, so that inappropriate automatic responses to startle and surprise can be avoided. Application: The model can be used to explain pilot behavior in accident cases, to design experiments and training simulations, to teach pilots metacognitive skills, and to identify intervention methods. © 2017, © 2017, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

The current study sought to address the roles of narcissism and promotion focus on optimism bias in risk perception in aviation context. Participants were 239 male flight cadets from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China who completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-13, the Work Regulatory Focus Scale, and an indirect measure of unrealistic optimism in risk perception, which measured risk perception for the individual and the risk assumed by other individuals performing the same task. Higher narcissism increased the likelihood of underestimating personal risks, an effect that was mediated by high promotion focus motivation, such that high narcissism led to high promotion focus motivation. The findings have important implications for improving the accuracy of risk perception in aviation risks among aviators. © 2016 International Union of Psychological Science"

Earlier research has suggested that cognitive biases such as the anchoring effect and confirmation bias are implicated in many decisions to continue into worsening weather. In this study, we explored whether a simple debiasing technique, ‘considering the alternative’, reduced the effect of these two potentially fatal biases. Despite the study being adequately powered, our attempts to reduce the effects of biases were both unsuccessful. Negative findings such as these are particularly useful in aviation, as they can provide information on what does not work in this high stakes industry, even though such strategies may work elsewhere. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Drowsiness detection systems can alert drowsy operators and potentially reduce the risk of crashes. In this study, a Google-Glass-based drowsiness detection system was developed and validated. Methods The proximity sensor of Google Glass was used to monitor eye blink frequency. A simulated driving study was carried out to validate the system. Driving performance and eye blinks were compared between the two states of alertness and drowsiness while driving. Results Drowsy drivers increased frequency of eye blinks, produced longer braking response time and increased lane deviation, compared to when they were alert. A threshold algorithm for proximity sensor can reliably detect eye blinks and proved the feasibility of using Google Glass to detect operator drowsiness. Applications This technology provides a new platform to detect operator drowsiness and has the potential to reduce drowsiness-related crashes in driving and aviation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Independently of the parachute jump, the psychophysiological responses of experienced paratroopers were not affected by the jumps, except for an increase in anaerobic metabolism. Novice parachute jumpers presented a higher psychophysiological stress response than the experienced jumpers, together with a large anticipatory anxiety response before the jump; however, this decreased after the jump, although the high physiological activation was maintained.

Some research has also highlighted a role for psychosocial factors including sleep, diet and ‘circadian’ health behaviours and illness cognitions although this remains relatively untested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sleep, diet and illness cognitions in predicting perceived jet lag amongst long-haul crew. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a longitudinal study. Profile characteristics (including chronotype), preparation strategies (sleep, eating and ‘circadian’ behaviours) and illness cognitions were measured at baseline (before a trip). Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) was measured on the crews’ second day off (post-trip). Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that unidimensional jet lag was predicted by the belief in a cyclical timeline, whereas multidimensional jet lag was predicted by multidimensional jet lag at baseline and to a lesser extent by identity. No role was found for profile characteristics and preparation strategies. Conclusion: Illness cognitions partly explain the experience of perceived jet lag in long-haul cabin crew indicating that jet lag is in part a psycho-social construct, not just a biological one. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

ADHD occurs in about 2.5% of adults. ADHD can be an excluding medical condition among pilots due to the risk of attentional degradation and therefore impact on flight safety. Diagnosis of ADHD is complex, which complicates aeromedical assessment. This study highlights fatal accident cases among pilots with ADHD and discusses protocols to detect its presence to help to assess its importance to flight safety. methods: To identify fatal accidents in aviation (including airplanes, helicopters, balloons, and gliders) in the United States between the years 2000 to 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database was searched with the terms ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). results: The NTSB database search for fatal aviation accidents possibly associated with ADHD yielded four accident cases of interest in the United States [4/4894 (0.08%)]. Two of the pilots had ADHD diagnosed by a doctor, one was reported by a family member, and one by a flight instructor. An additional five cases were identified searching for ADD [5/4894 (0.1%)]. Altogether, combined ADHD and ADD cases yielded nine accident cases of interest (0.18%). discussion: It is generally accepted by aviation regulatory authorities that ADHD is a disqualifying neurological condition.

The faceLAB is used to collect eye movements' data recorded from 14 air traffic controllers. Statistical analysis and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) are carried out to investigate the fundamental properties of eye movements. The analytical results show that 1) expert controllers have longer mean fixation duration, less fixation points, shorter mean saccadic duration, and smaller mean saccadic velocity than novices; 2) Controllers' fixation time series, saccadic duration time series, and saccadic amplitude time series, allexhibit multifractal characteristics, and multifractal singularity spectrum demonstrates that there are stronger fluctuations in novices' fixation activities.

Background: Identifying variables that predict skilled performance in a complex task aids in understanding the nature of skill and also aids in the selection of operators to perform that task. SA is thought to be an important predictor of performance. SAis often thought to be based on underlying cognitive mechanisms. Method: Three performance measures taken from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Air Traffic Scenarios Test, the low-fidelity simulation component of the FAA's controller selection battery, were used as criterion variables in a hierarchical regression. After predicting performance based on a battery of cognitive (c.g., intelligence, working memory, spatial memory) and noncognitivc tests (c.g., cognitive style, personality, demographies), we added measures of SA. Results: SA did provide increases in prediction, but only when measured with the Situation Present Assessment Method, an on-line query method. When the same questions were asked off line, SA did not enter the model in two eases and improved prediction by only 2% in the third. Conclusion: Thus, some measures of SAdo show incremental validity, even against a backdrop of a large number of cognitive variables. Application: On-line measures of SAcan be a worthwhile addition to standard batteries of tests used to predict performance in cognitively oriented industrial tasks. © Eduardo Salas and Aaron S.

The relationships between anthropometric variables (human level), activities (context level), seat characteristics (product level) and the perception of comfort and discomfort were studied through mediating variables, such as body posture, movement and interface pressure. It is concluded that there are correlations between anthropometric variables and interface pressure variables, and that this relationship is affected by body posture. The results of studies on the correlation between pressure variables and passenger comfort and discomfort are not in line with each other. Only associations were found between the other variables (e.g. activities and seat characteristics). A conceptual model illustrates the results of the review, but relationships could not be quantified due to a lack of statistical evidence and large differences in research set-ups between the reviewed papers.

Hypoxia symptoms include sensory and cognitive effects; of these, it is important to identify which components of operator performance are most vulnerable to hypoxia-induced decline in order to determine which sensory modality is most effective for alerting an impaired aviator of an imminent hypoxic episode. METHODS: A study was performed in a hypobaric chamber to characterize deterioration of cognitive performance under moderate (MH) and severe (SH) hypoxia conditions, culminating in subjects' inability to perform tasks. Subjects operated a synthetic workstation, performing multiple simultaneous tasks during hypobaric exposures equivalent to 5486 m (18,000 ft) MH and 7620 m (25,000 ft) SH ascents. Performance was compared across baseline, altitude exposure, and recovery periods within MH vs. SH altitude profiles. Ascents lasted until at least one of a list of termination criteria was met, at which point the chamber was returned to ground level pressure and the subject resumed workstation performance during recovery. RESULTS: SH conditions generated greater deficits than MH conditions, and these more severe effects hastened the termination of exposures (5 vs. 18 min mean duration, respectively). Workstation performance collapsed rapidly on SH exposure, with Mathematics and Auditory Monitoring tasks proving vulnerable to breakdown. In MH exposures, these tasks exhibited impaired accuracy (declining 11% and 9%, respectively) and speed, with declines in Auditory Monitoring lingering into recovery. DISCUSSION: The relative robustness of memory and visual monitoring vs. the vulnerability of mathematical and auditory processing suggest that care should be taken designing purely auditory cockpit hypoxia warning alerts. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

The purpose of this study was analyze the incidence of: (1) triggering the security alarm; (2) extra security searches; (3) perceived inconvenience; and (4) presence of other surgical hardware in those who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and passed through airport security. A questionnaire was given to 125 consecutive patients with a TKA. Those who passed through airport security after January 2014 were considered for inclusion. A questionnaire was administered that addressed the number of encounters with airport security, metal detector activation, additional screening procedures, and perceived inconvenience. Out of the 125 patients, 53 met inclusion criteria. Out of the 53 patients, 20 (38%) reported that their prosthesis triggered a metal detector. Out of the 20 patients, 8 (40%) who reported triggering of metal detectors also reported the presence of surgical hardware elsewhere in the body. Eighteen of the 53 patients (34%) believed having a TKA was inconvenient for airplane travel. Compared with the historical cohort, alarms were triggered in 70 of 97 patients (p = 0.0001) and 50 of 97 reported inconvenience when traveling (n = 50 of 97 patients; p = 0.04). The incidences of those who underwent TKA triggering alarms and perceiving inconvenience when passing through airport security have decreased from previously published studies. This is most likely due to the recent updates and modifications to screening.

Existing works used video monitoring and social network mining to find the potential anomalies in pilot's daily life. However, video monitoring suffers from the privacy problems and social network mining is computational complex. To solve the problems of existing works, we propose a novel pilot anomaly detection method using step-sensors. The key idea of this method is that the pilots step information reflects their daily behaviors, and it is also influenced by the behaviors of the pilots social networks; if a pilot step number is extremely different from his historical step numbers or the step numbers of his social networks, this would probably be an anomaly. We, therefore, use the step-sensor to collect pilots step information and use the cluster method to detect anomalies. Experiments are held on 65 pilot candidates, which are divided into two social groups. We collect their step information during 50 days. Using our proposed anomaly detection method, outliers can be successfully detected for further analysis. Our method is also free of privacy problem and is highly efficient. © 2017 IEEE."

As the primary cause of software defects, human error can be the key to understanding and preventing software defects. This paper proposes a defect prevention approach based on human error mechanisms: DPeHE. The approach includes both knowledge and regulation training in human error prevention. Knowledge training provides programmers with explicit knowledge on why programmers commit errors, what kinds of errors tend to be committed under different circumstances, and how these errors can be prevented. Regulation training further helps programmers to promote the awareness and ability to prevent human errors through practice. The practice is facilitated by a problem solving checklist and a root cause identification checklist. This paper provides a systematic framework that integrates knowledge across disciplines, e.g., cognitive science, software psychology and software engineering to defend against human errors in software development. Furthermore, we applied this approach in an international company at CMM Level 5 and a software development institution at CMM Level 1 in the Chinese Aviation Industry. The application cases show that the approach is feasible and effective in promoting developers’ ability to prevent software defects, independent of process maturity levels. © 2017 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics"

The differences between PA preferences and actual opportunities for these PA are an issue that has received frequent attention. To date, the extent to which these differences are reflected in adolescents meeting PA recommendations and their well-being has not been explored. In total, 10,086 respondents took part in an on-line research project regarding PA preferences. Of them, 2446 also completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Long Form) and the World Health Organization (WHO) W-5 questionnaire to assess well-being. Finally, 1278 of these respondents were involved in objective PA monitoring using pedometers. The study aimed to explore the prevalence and trends regarding outdoor PA. Moreover, we assessed whether the agreement between preferred PA and PA actually undertaken was associated with higher odds for meeting PA recommendations and achieving a higher level of well-being. Of a selection of outdoor activities, Czech and Polish boys preferred cycling, swimming, and downhill skiing, while girls preferred swimming activities, skating, and cycling. The agreement between preferred and PA actually undertaken was associated with higher odds for meeting the weekly PA recommendations and higher levels of well-being both in boys and girls. Evaluation of outdoor PA preferences and taking these preferred activities into account when forming conditions for them was important in the efficient promotion of the physical and mental health of adolescents. © 2017 by the authors.

The aviation community is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of these factors but is hampered in its efforts to improve the system because of research psychology's problems in defining the nature of the group process. This article identifies some of the problem areas as well as methods used to address these issues. It is argued that high fidelity flight simulators provide an environment that offers unique opportunities for work meeting both basic and applied research criteria. © Eduardo Salas, Katherine A.

"Go/no-go decision in anaesthesia: wide variation in risk tolerance amongst anaesthetists","2017","British Journal of Anaesthesia","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029804417&partnerID=40&md5=5b521fea8210ace1f87e2e95035dc876","Background: The variability in risk tolerance in medicine is not well understood. Parallels are often drawn between aviation and anaesthesia. The aviation industry is perceived as culturally risk averse, and part of preflight checks involves a decision on whether the flight can operate. This is sometimes termed a go/no-go decision. This questionnaire study was undertaken to explore the equivalent go/no-go decision in anaesthesia. We presented anaesthetists with a range of situations in which additional risk might be expected and asked them to decide whether they would proceed with the case. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to anaesthetic colleagues of all grades in one National Health Service Trust. Eleven scenarios, all drawn from critical incident data, were presented. Participants were invited to consider whether they would proceed, how they would modify their anaesthetic technique, and to predict whether a colleague with similar experience would make the same decision. Textual responses were analysed qualitatively. Results: The scenario response rate was 28%. Consultants were significantly more likely to proceed than trainees. In no scenario was there absolute agreement over whether to proceed, even in scenarios where national guidelines would suggest a case should be cancelled. Thematic analysis suggested a wide variability in what anaesthetists consider acceptable or professional behaviour. Conclusions: It is clear that safety decisions cannot be made in isolation and that clinicians must consider operational requirements, such as throughput, when making a go/no-go decision. The level of variability in decision-making was surprising, particularly for scenarios that appeared to go against guidelines. © 2017 The Author(s)"

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with comparison between the performance of Israeli Air Force pilot cadets (N = 318) and U.S. Air Force pilot training candidates (N = 512) as assessed by a cognitive battery was undertaken. The data of the comparison group was collected from Callister, King, and Retzlaff, as published in 1996. RESULTS: In general, the means in the three components composing the battery-speed, accuracy, and throughput variables- indicated that the Israeli Air Force pilot cadets' scores were higher than those of the U.S. Air Force pilot candidates' scores in 50 of 53 variables. Nonsignificant differences were found in Accuracy of shifting attention-arrow color (SATAC), pathfinder-combined (PFC), and pathfinder-letter (PFL). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in performance between the two groups may be due to differences in population characteristics. However, these results need to be considered cautiously, as the groups were sampled at a sizeable time gap (1996 for the U.S. Air Force vs. 2013 for the Israeli Air Force), with each time period characterized by different cultural and technological influences. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."
"Incorporating human error education into software engineering courses via error-based inspections","2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018352773&partnerID=40&md5=2cc095ce2d2d51036fe52616b849c12a","In spite of the human-centric aspect of software engineering (SE) discipline, human error knowledge has been ignored by SE educators as it is often thought of as something that belongs in the realm of Psychology. SE curriculum is also severely devoid of educational content on human errors, while other human-centric disciplines (aviation, medicine, process control) have developed human error training and other interventions. To evaluate the feasibility of using such interventions to teach students about human errors in SE, this paper describes an exploratory study to evaluate whether requirements inspections driven by human errors can be used to deliver both requirements validation knowledge (a key industry skill) and human error knowledge to students. The results suggest that human error based inspections can enhance the fault detection abilities of students, a primary learning outcome of inspection exercises conducted in software engineering courses. Additionally, results showed that students found human error information useful for understanding the underlying causes of requirement faults. © 2017 ACM."

The understanding of decision making, communication and the other dimensions of team interaction within aircrews and other teams in highly stressful situations, is based on a multitude of diverse factors, each with its own literature and individual studies. This book is about how teams function in just such situations, providing a uniquely integrated and interdisciplinary account of the dynamics and main explanatory factors of team interaction under high workload. The book stems from the interdisciplinary research project 'Group Interaction in High Risk Environments' (GIHRE), a Collegium of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation. The goals of the project, and therefore the book, are to investigate, analyze and understand the behavior of professional groups working in high risk environments and to develop practical suggestions for enhancing performance. A central focus of this book is how groups in these professions deal with the factors that can threaten the safety and effectiveness of their task performance, whether these factors are part of the environment or part of the team itself. Four representative workplaces were investigated in three broad settings: in aviation, the cockpit of a commercial airliner; in medicine, the operating room and the intensive care unit of a hospital; in nuclear power, the control room of a nuclear power plant. The international and interdisciplinary composition of the Collegium ensures the book features a variety of different methodological and conceptual approaches, which are brought to bear at both theoretical and practical levels. Readers working in all related fields will find value in the case descriptions, the academic synthesis of the similarities between them, and ways to approach new challenges; specialists in applied psychology, human factors and technical management will gain new insights. © Rainer Dietrich and Traci Michelle Childress 2004.

The rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms was assessed in CCATT personnel and their rates were compared to general aeromedical evacuation (AE) personnel. As part of a computer-based occupational stress survey, 188 crew members (138 AE nurses and technicians, 50 CCATT nurses and respiratory therapists) completed the PTSD Checklist – Military Version. A categorical MEET/DOES NOT MEET CRITERIA variable was created, and a Fisher’s exact test was computed to identify differences between groups. Contingency table analyses were used to assess associations between demographic and occupational variables with meeting criteria. χ2 or Fisher’s exact test results, relative risks, and 95% confidence intervals were obtained, with 4.35% of AE and 14.00% of CCATT crew members meeting PTSD symptom criteria. The CCATT crew members were 3.22 times (95% confidence interval = 1.14–9.12) more likely to meet symptom criteria than AE, and for CCATT meeting criteria, the most commonly endorsed symptoms were arousal and avoidance. The demographic and occupational factors assessed in this study were not associated with meeting PTSD symptom criteria.

A cross-sectional survey investigating attitudes and experiences of fatigue was developed and distributed to commercial airline pilots. Results found pilots who reported typically spending longer hours on duty per week were twice as likely to report feeling depressed or anxious. Pilots' experiences of job-related sleep disturbance and fatigue may explain why pilots who typically spend long hours on duty each week are more likely to report feeling depressed or anxious. © © 2016 The Author(s)."

These medications were praised by many in the aviation community who were concerned with pilots underreporting mental health issues or engaging in self-medication. The purpose of this study was to complete a follow-up to a study, initially conducted prior to a 2015 Germanwings accident where a European commercial airliner crashed in an alleged case of pilot suicide. In the previous study, consumers were asked their willingness to fly when their pilot was taking various medications (fluoxetine, loratadine, ibuprofen or clonidine); and the findings suggest that the fluoxetine condition produces the lowest willingness to fly scores. The current study was replicated longitudinally in the weeks following the Germanwings accident. The findings of the current study reveal a significant drop in willingness to fly scores for the fluoxetine condition immediately after the accident; however, there is no significant change to the other medications.

In the present pilot study, we investigated the effect of diaphragmatic breathing (DB) as a relaxation technique during VR exposure treatment. Method: Twenty-nine patients with aviophobia were randomly assigned to VR exposure treatment either with or without diaphragmatic breathing (six cycles per minute). Subjective fear ratings, heart rate and skin conductance were assessed as indicators of fear during both the exposure and the test session one week later. Results: The group that experienced VR exposure combined with diaphragmatic breathing showed a higher tendency to effectively overcome the fear of flying. Psychophysiological measures of fear decreased and self-efficacy increased in both groups with no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that diaphragmatic breathing during VR exposure does not interfere with the treatment outcome and may even enhance treatment effects of VR exposure therapy for aviophobic patients.

This book, Aeromedical Psychology, is designed to provide the means for a variety of clinicians to carry out sound assessment and selection procedures, perform informed evaluations and make subsequent recommendations regarding flight status and treatment strategies geared to the aviation environment. To facilitate a dynamic understanding of the field, the book emphasizes an integration of applications and theory, case examples and research. The book is divided into three parts. The first presents assessment and selection procedures for aviation personnel (i.e. air traffic controllers, flight officers and pilots) and astronauts and the many ways in which both psychologists and psychiatrists are involved in these roles. In the second part, the waiver standards put forth by both the FAA and the various branches of the military are presented, as well as the waiver decision process. Clinical issues unique to aviation - notably fear of flying, motivation to fly and airsickness - are addressed, as well as possible courses of intervention, treatment and disposition. In the final part, more specialized issues pertaining to aeromedical psychology are dealt with, namely the psychopharmacological research and regulations applicable to recreational pilots and aviation personnel, managing the aftermath of aviation mishaps and the psychologist's role in accident investigations. © 2013 by Carrie H.

When conducting an aviation mental health examination of a commercial pilot or military aviator, the primary consideration is ultimately flight safety. A mental health assessment should provide information on the rate of progression of any identified disorder when such information can be determined with reasonable certainty. Although the mental health evaluation includes several different components, including mental health testing, the clinical interview with the referred airman remains an essential part of any mental health evaluation.

In what way can a flight crew mediate problems? How are we to understand reported errors? Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety presents recent findings in aviation psychology, bringing fresh insights to such questions. Aviation psychologists study personnel selection and training; they evaluate the management of flight operations, and ultimately they analyse the things that went wrong. The strong interrelation between these components allows us to talk about a chain of safety. This volume appraises this chain of safety by considering the mechanisms that determine its effectiveness - input mechanisms, coping mechanisms and control mechanisms. Each contribution discusses a component of the chain while the book as a whole emphasizes and illustrates that understanding the connections between these parts is essential for the future. By addressing these issues the book leads to further considerations such as how mistakes are linked to training and how coping mechanisms should help us to understand errors and accidents. Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety will appeal to aviation professionals (human factors experts, safety managers, pilots, ATCOs, air navigation service providers, etc.) and academics, researchers, graduates and postgraduates in human factors and psychology. Although primarily written for the aviation industry, this book will also be of interest to other high-risk dynamic activities that face similar challenges: the need to present effective and safe outcomes to the public in general and the stakeholders in particular. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C.

The First World War was the background for the development of personnel selection methods that countered pilot attrition rates in the early years of military aviation. Selection methods that were originally developed for aviation have since been widely adopted by other domains. After the Second World War, a new line of research emerged that was concerned with safety, in particular the role of the pilot in the safe operation of an aircraft. Accident statistics, safety management, human/machine interaction and human error are just a few topics that were advanced as a consequence. Again, the results of these efforts were influential elsewhere and aviation remained a leading industry where ideas on safety have been expanded and investigated. In the 1990s, a third line of research within aviation psychology that studies the interaction of people within a team became known as “crew resource management”. Focus on human interaction, as related to performance, also received major attention in the aviation industry. Despite their successive origins, all three themes have continued to develop within aviation psychology and have not lost their attraction for future research. Selection methods are continuously studied, particularly in the area of air traffic control. Theories on safety are still evolving and many aspects of aviation safety are in continuous need of attention. In addition, research on crew resource management is still gaining momentum. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C. D’Oliveira 2012."

Research on attention-related human performance limiting states (AHPLS) such as channelized attention, diverted attention, startle/surprise, and confirmation bias, has been recommended in a Safety Enhancement (SE) entitled “Training for Attention Management.” To accomplish the detection of such cognitive and psychophysiological states, a broad suite of sensors was implemented to simultaneously measure their physiological markers during a high fidelity flight simulation human subject study. Twenty-four pilot participants were asked to wear the sensors while they performed benchmark tasks and motion-based flight scenarios designed to induce AHPLS. Pattern classification was employed to predict the occurrence of AHPLS during flight simulation also designed to induce those states. Classifier training data were collected during performance of the benchmark tasks. Multimodal classification was performed, using pre-processed electroencephalography, galvanic skin response, electrocardiogram, and respiration signals as input features. A combination of one, some or all modalities were used. Extreme gradient boosting, random forest and two support vector machine classifiers were implemented. The best accuracy for each modality-classifier combination is reported. Results using a select set of features and using the full set of available features are presented. Further, results are presented for training one classifier with the combined features and for training multiple classifiers with features from each modality separately. Using the select set of features and combined training, multistate prediction accuracy averaged 0.64 +/- 0.14 across thirteen participants and was significantly higher than that for the separate training case. These results support the goal of demonstrating simultaneous real-time classification of multiple states using multiple sensing modalities in high fidelity flight simulators. This detection is intended to support and inform training methods under development to mitigate the loss of ASA and thus reduce accidents and incidents. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Although their avoidance has been a crucial part of training in aviation for the past twenty years, it has been largely ignored in many other occupations with team structures similar to those in aviation. In such professions and workplaces, those involved are under high stress, with enormous workloads, simultaneously completing mental and motor tasks, facing unexpected situations involving great risk, and with uncertain final outcomes. The goal of researchers is to find ways to minimize human error and to understand the interaction amongst the members of the team fulfilling the task. Specialized training programmes, good management and clear rules that lay out which member is responsible for making decisions can be the first steps to reducing and managing such errors. This book is a major result of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation’s 6th Berlin Colloquium, ‘Interaction in High Risk Environments’, hosted in 2002 by the Psycholinguistic Group of the Humbolt University Institute for German Language and Linguistics.

"Affective human factors in aviation","2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054185548&partnerID=40&md5=94dfa8ee5fa5657f8b5349e69cf79d2f","Conventional Human Factors/Ergonomics (HF/E) approaches in aviation concentrate on the product's or system's utility and underestimates the power of the users' feelings. By a majority, HF/E emphasizes on ease of access, human performance, human error, workload and situation awareness, which are related with the functional features of the system, without emotional interactions. However, it is now clear that the success of the product in the market comes from its aesthetic appeal and the affect it creates on the users; the interaction between the user and the designed artifact is impressed by emotions. There has been a growing interest in research of industrial design, engineering design, psychology, neuroscience, and human factors engineering to affect and pleasure. There is a shift from cognitive perspective to affective, which concerns promoting pleasure instead of preventing pain (workload, error, etc.) resulting by the design. There are many studies in the literature focused on the consumer products. However, complex systems like aviation industry where performance and safety is the main point, is still impassive to affective design, the theoretical constructs related to affective design have been poorly defined. Affective considerations might provide a new and different perspective in aviation human factors. This study will present the importance of affective human factors in aviation and purposes some suggestions to reflect affective design to cockpit design. © 2017 by American Helicopter Society International, Inc.

"Impact of retinal stimulation on neuromodulation","2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053495984&partnerID=40&md5=b064639c850bfb53382e88b911eadebf","Historically, experts have considered the retina as a sensory system, feeding information into the brain’s visual cortex. However, research has now demonstrated that the retina is a bidirectional neural interface that is an actual part of the central nervous system (CNS) (Vaney 1999). Since retinal signals are processed by many regions of the brain—not just the visual cortex—the implication is that retinal stimulation can affect other physical, physiological, and psychological processes, such as motor control, biochemical activity, and cognitive abilities. During the past decades, researchers have discovered a retinal cell type that responds to luminance (external light) levels. These photosensitive cells combine the external luminance information with signals obtained through eyesight and not only send this combined feedforward information to the brain but concurrently receive feedback signals from the body (Chen et al. 2011, 2013, Schmidt et al. 2011). The mixture of feedforward and feedback signaling enables the retina to be used as a twoway, noninvasive portal for influencing and monitoring body functions and thought processes, largely beneath the level of consciousness. Because of the retina’s critical role in brain function, therapeutic eyeglasses—an important tool in neuro-optometric rehabilitation—may be used to modify processing in a range of physical and mental health disorders. These individualized lenses can change the dynamic relationship between the mind’s visual inputs and the body’s internal responses by altering spatial and temporal distribution of light on the retina. The novel use of light to affect the nervous system has already been successfully applied to a range of disorders, including jaundice (Tayman et al. 2010), jet lag (Parry 2002), seasonal affective disorder (Lavoie et al. 2009), brain injury (Naeser et al. 2011, Sinclair et al. 2014), and spinal cord injury (Alilain et al. 2008, Alilain and Silver 2009). Neuro-optometry also uses light to modulate brain and body functions. This chapter presents both the theoretical framework and empirical evidence to support the use of customized eyeglasses for altering brain function. The underlying premise is that there exists a hierarchy of separate, yet interdependent, cortical and subcortical pathways, which are linked to various visual systems. The main emphasis of this discussion is on the retina’s complex connections with systems other than the conscious eyesight. Those subconscious and unconscious systems can be altered by changes in the amount, frequency, intensity, or direction of incoming light to the eye. The following section overviews retinal function, at cortical and subcortical levels, with examples of how the mind and body adapt to environmental changes. The third section discusses retinal structure. The fourth section introduces the concept of neuromodulation, and its effects on behavior and processing. Neuromodulation is described here as the process of achieving balance between mental and physical functions at both conscious and nonconscious levels. The fifth section describes the impact that eyeglasses can have on the nervous system. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Preliminary model to quantify impacts of spacecraft design choices on crew performance","2017","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051550738&partnerID=40&md5=d503d755933d9da8f1c6052737224666","Spacecraft have historically been designed for vehicle performance with the assumption that astronauts can adapt to any given hardware configuration. This design approach grew out of the early aviation era and into the Apollo Program and is by-and-large true today. It is well known, however, that poor human-machine design integration can lead to catastrophic mishaps. As a result, academia and industry has begun to recognize crew performance modeling as an important step in the spacecraft design process. Adequate modeling of this problem can help designers and managers make better decisions throughout the design process, thereby ensuring crewmembers are well-integrated with the system from the start. While a comprehensive and fully predictive crew performance model may be some time away, we can begin laying the groundwork for developing such a model. The work presented in this paper focuses on laying this groundwork by developing an integrated framework to qualify relationships between crew performance and various spacecraft design choices. Specifically, a basic element resource breakdown approach to defining crew performance was utilized. Crewmembers are characterized through three resource ""buckets"": Physiology, Cognition, and Psychology. Each crewmember's resource ""buckets"" are drained or refilled throughout the mission by various Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs). While PSFs can range across all aspects of the mission, from specific design choices, to high-level management structure, this particular work focused solely on the spacecraft design PSFs. The framework was then cast into a semi-quantitative model and representative test scenarios were run. The mathematical model is limited by the general lack of experimental information available. As a result, it was only able to demonstrate the mechanics of the framework, but unable to predict a specific value for crew performance. The framework presented here represents a novel approach for quantifying human spacecraft design impacts on the crew's performance and sets the stage for future work in validation or filling gaps in missing experimental knowledge. © 2017 by The Pennsylvania State University."
"Cognitive systems engineering: The future for a changing world","2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050202107&partnerID=40&md5=dee664e62bc3dcc95ff5c66931e2aca6","This volume provides an exceptional perspective on the nature, evolution, contributions and future of the field of Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE). It is a resource to support both the teaching and practice of CSE. It accomplishes this through its organization into two complementary approaches to the topic. The first is an historical perspective: In the retrospections of leaders of the field, what have been the seminal achievements of cognitive human factors? What are the “lessons learned” that became foundational to CSE, and how did that foundation evolve into a broader systems view of cognitive work? The second perspective is both pedagogical and future-looking: What are the major conceptual issues that have to be addressed by CSE and how can a new generation of researchers be prepared to further advance CSE? Topics include studies of expertise, cognitive work analysis, cognitive task analysis, human performance, system design, cognitive modeling, decision making, human-computer interaction, trust in automation, teamwork and ecological interface design. A thematic focus will be on systems-level analysis, and such notions as resilience engineering and systems-level measurement. The book features broad coverage of many of the domains to which CSE is being applied, among them industrial process control, health care, decision aiding and aviation human factors. The book’s contributions are provided by an extraordinary group of leaders and pathfinders in applied psychology, cognitive science, systems analysis and system design. In combination these chapters present invaluable insights, experiences and continuing uncertainties on the subject of the field of CSE, and in doing so honor the career and achievements of Professor David D.

"Pupil diameter and performance in a supervisory control task: A measure of effort or individual differences?","2017","Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042479317&partnerID=40&md5=7fe5c464c32e8a7331a66be2651b9d1d","The relationship between increased pupil diameter and effort has been well established within the Psychology literature since the 1960s. The ability to detect an individuals' effort is important, particularly in tasks where there are extended periods of monitoring, and limited ways to directly measure performance. The current study sought to investigate whether pupil diameter could be used to detect periods of high and low workload during an unmanned vehicle supervisory control task. Participants were Navy and Marine Corps student pilots, and the experimenters had access to their aviation selection test scores. The study found increased pupil diameters when the task load increased. In addition, pupil diameter during the high task load condition was significantly correlated with the individual's performance on the supervisory control task. This paper discusses two possible explanations for this finding: 1) that those individuals who performed better on the task were trying harder or, 2) that pupil diameter was capturing differences in general fluid intelligence which influenced task performance. Previous research has shown that differences in an individual's working memory capacity are correlated with pupil diameter at rest. Further the significant correlation between pupil diameter and the pilot's selection test scores in this study provide additional evidence that pupil diameter may be capturing individual differences."

Applied philosophy at its best, the book will affect the way you do your work and live your life.’ -Professor Esa Saarinen, Aalto University This book addresses how organizations can deal with human fallibility in order to create space for excellence at work. Some mistakes in work settings put lives at risk, while others create openings for innovative breakthroughs. In order to deal constructively with fallibility, an organization needs a communication climate where it is normal to voice opinions, admit mistakes, and ask for help in critical situations. The book builds on interviews with practitioners in healthcare, aviation, IT, public governance, and industry. It connects narratives from these fields with theories from organizational psychology and philosophy, as well as from positive organizational scholarship. In the final chapter, an overall ethics of fallibility at work is outlined. Fallibility at Work contributes to research in multiple academic disciplines, but also reaches out to practitioners who are interested in the connections between error and excellence in organizations. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017."

OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study was to identify whether there are differences in comfort experiences during different phases of a flight. The second objective of this study was to identify similarities between recalled and real time reported comfort experiences. METHODS: 149 participants were asked to rate the comfort in the different phases of their last flight on a scale from 1-10. Additionally, a combination of a self-reporting design probe and generative interview was used to investigate the appraisal patterns of emotions in nine passengers. RESULTS: The 149 subjects reported the highest comfort after take-off and arriving at the destination, the lowest while stowing the luggage and during the cruise flight. The qualitative long haul inflight study showed after take-off and while arriving at the destination the most positive emotions and during the cruise flight there is a negative experience phase. CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions are given to improve the cruise flight phase, by for example stimulation of movement or better service. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved."

Methods: Study participants were sixty adults with normal audiometric thresholds divided into two groups matched for age and gender: study group (SG), comprising 30 air traffic controllers and control group (CG), composed of 30 other military and civil servants. All participants were asked a number of questions regarding their health, communication, and attention, and underwent the Speech-in-Noise Test (SIN) to assess their closure skills and the Synthetic Sentence Identification Test - Ipsilateral Competitive Message (SSI-ICM) in monotic listening to evaluate their figure-ground abilities. Data were compared using nonparametric statistical tests and logistic regression analysis. Results: More individuals in the SG reported fatigue and/or burnout and work-related stress and showed better performance than that of individuals in the CG for the figure-ground ability. Both groups performed similarly and satisfactorily in the other hearing tests. The odds ratio for participants belonging in the SG was 5.59 and 1.24 times regarding work-related stress and SSI-ICM (right ear), respectively. Conclusion: Results for the variables auditory closure, self-reported health, attention, and communication were similar in both groups. The SG presented significantly better performance in auditory figure-ground compared with that of the CG. Self-reported stress and right-ear SSI-ICM were significant predictors of individuals belonging to the SG."

Research suggests, however, that the problem is more complex than that. Not only one’s experience is of importance-temperament, aggression and risk may also affect the decision-making process under stressful conditions. Material and Methods: We examined 97 male pilots of passenger planes, who had flew ATRs, Boeings, Airbuses, Embraers, and Saabs. The comparative group was made up of 127 graduates of technical studies (not connected with aviation). In our study, we used the following methods: the PTS (Pavlovian Temperament Survey) Temperament Questionnaire by Strelau, the Aggression Questionnaire by Buss and Perry, and the Stimulating-Instrumental Risk Inventory (SIRI) by Zaleśkiewicz. Results: Following the analyses we could categorize the pilots into 3 distinct groups: group 1-strong type of nervous system with a tendency to avoid risk; group 2-strong type of nervous system with a tendency to take risks; group 3-the relatively weakest type of nervous system with a tendency toward aggressive behavior. Conclusions: Members of each group were analyzed to assess how they function in a task situation, i.e., whilst piloting a passenger plane. The study showed that individuals with high need for stimulation may-consciously or not-seek situations of excessive or unnecessary risks, and this is done in order to reach the right level of stimulation. A constellation of the following variables: temperament, risk, and aggression could be-we argue-useful in psychological examinations, and should be taken into account in training procedures for pilots. © 2017 MEDYCYNA PRACY, All Right Reserved."

It's also known from relevant research and reports that even the smallest error made by a person can cause fatal results in the aviation sector. In this study, the relationship between factors that contribute to trainee error based on scores achieved in pilot training, such as personality traits, psychomotor abilities, audio-visual memory capacity and quantitative skills of pilots, are determined by means of a multiple regression analysis. In the study, the total number of errors that a sample of 24 civilian student pilots made in initial and advanced flight training was evaluated. According to the results of the regression analysis, it was determined that the errors student pilots made during these flight training periods had a close relationship to their personality traits. For this reason, while selecting student pilots, it's necessary to predict a student pilot's personality traits. Additionally, by taking the factors that are the focus of this study into consideration, the selection of suitable student pilots having a low probability of making errors is possible. © 2017 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences."

Trust is considered as a mechanism for facilitating the effects of a leader on employee citizenship behaviors. Increasingly research has focused on the role of trust in a safety context; however, the role of coworker trust has been overlooked. OBJECTIVES: The mediating role of coworker trust in the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior is the focus of this field study. METHODS: Front-line employees from an air traffic control center and an airline maintenance department completed surveys measuring leader-member exchange, co-worker trust, and safety citizenship behavior. RESULTS: Structural Equation Modeling revealed affective and cognitive trust in coworkers is influenced by leader-member exchange. A trust-based mediation model where cognitive trust and affective trust mediate the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior emerged. CONCLUSION: Results of this study add to our understanding of the relationship between leader-member exchange and safety behavior. The effect of co-worker trust and the extent to which employees participate in workplace safety practice were identified as critical factors.

The impact of cognitive and behavioral factors in the explanation of adverse events has been studied in other high-stakes areas such as aviation and nuclear power. Specific protocols have been developed to reduce rates of human error, and, where human error is unavoidable, to lessen its impact.

This diagnosis applies particularly to bipolar disorder (BD), where return to flying duty is not an option in the majority of cases. BD is a long-term mental disorder presenting remittent depressive, hypomanic, manic, or mixed episodes between low symptomatic or asymptomatic intermediate periods. Onset in most cases is in late teen or early adult years. Suicidal intentions and suicide risk are significantly elevated in individuals with BD compared to the general population. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed of BD and aviation accidents and the National Transportation Safety Board database of fatal general aviation accidents was searched. One case report and two database reports of interest from 1994 to 2014 were identified. RESULTS: The findings set a minimum frequency of BD in general aviation fatalities to be approximately 2 out of 8648 (0.023%) in the United States. DISCUSSION: The reported incidence may underestimate the real number of BD cases for several reasons, including the fact that the medical history of pilots is not always available or is sometimes not the primary interest of a safety investigation. This study suggests that the demarcation of psychiatric disorder related to fitness to fly is an important step in safety. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether our BCI system, which involves decoding the signals of two 96-microelectrode arrays implanted into the motor cortex of a subject, could also be used to control an aircraft in a flight simulator environment. The study involved six sessions in which various parameters were modified in order to achieve the best flight control, including plane type, view, control paradigm, gains, and limits. Successful flight was determined qualitatively by evaluating the subject's ability to perform requested maneuvers, maintain flight paths, and avoid control losses such as dives, spins and crashes. By the end of the study, it was found that the subject could successfully control an aircraft. The subject could use both the jet and propeller plane with different views, adopting an intuitive control paradigm. From the subject's perspective, this was one of the most exciting and entertaining experiments she had performed in two years of research. In conclusion, this study provides a proof-of-concept that traditional motor cortex signals combined with a decoding paradigm can be used to control systems besides a robotic arm for which the decoder was developed. Aside from possible functional benefits, it also shows the potential for a new recreational activity for individuals with disabilities who are able to master BCI control. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Travel barriers, such as difficulty finding one's way throughout an airport, may adversely affect older adults' travel experience, thereby reducing their desire to travel. This review of the literature investigates wayfinding strategies to ensure that older passengers who have planned to travel independently can do so with dignity. These include facility planning and design strategies (e.g., layout, signage) and technological solutions. Although technological approaches, such as smart phone apps, appear to offer the most promising new solutions for enhancing airport navigation, more traditional approaches, such as designing facilities with an intuitive building layout, are still heavily relied upon in the aviation industry. While there are many design guidelines for enhancing wayfinding for older adults, many are not based on scientific investigation. © 2016"

Although, current military training requirements are inadequate for developing pattern recognition and behavior detection, research shows that Simulation-based Training, via virtual environments (VE’s) can improve pattern recognition and behavior detection skills. However, the use of VEs for visually dependent tasks may also increase simulator sickness in some individuals. This experiment compared a virtual version of Kim’s game (i.e., an observational game to increase memory and performance) to a control group to assess the role of simulator sickness on performance. Participants were randomly assigned to either the Kim’s game or control condition and completed a pre-test, training vignette, and post-test. During the experiment, participants recorded their level of simulator sickness using a questionnaire developed by Kennedy et al. (International Journal of Aviation Psychology 3:203-220, 1993 [1]). The data analysis revealed that the Kim’s game group reported higher levels of simulator sickness symptoms which had a negative effect on performance (i.e., detection accuracy and false positive detection). The results also indicated that there was a positive correlation in the control group between disorientation and detection accuracy. This implies that the control group may have become familiar with the experimental task, suggesting that simulator sickness did not negatively impact their performance. The following paper discusses the influence of simulator sickness on performance and offers new ways to reduce simulator sickness for behavior cue detection training. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017."

Methods Aviation’s validated computer-based Computerized Pilot Aptitude and Screening System (COMPASS) and Checklist Professional Profile (CPP) were applied to 166 final year medical students during a surgical clerkship between 2013 and 2015. Results All trainees completed COMPASS and CPP within the prescribed 2 hours. Compared with an age-matched and gender-matched cohort of 165 pilot candidates, medical trainees scored significantly higher on eye-hand coordination (p<0.001), need for variation (p<0.001), empathy (p=0.006), helpfulness (p<0.001) and autonomy (p<0.001). Pilot candidates scored higher on eye-hand-foot coordination (p<0.001), spatial orientation (p<0.001), persuasiveness (p<0.001), stress tolerance (p<0.001), dominance (p<0.001), ambition (p<0.001) and resilience (p<0.001). Conclusions Final year medical trainees from one medical school were able to complete aviation’s sensorimotor skills and personality traits selection instruments within the set time frame. They scored differently from aviation trainees on selected skills and personality traits. The applicability and utility of aviation instruments to presurgical training preparation remains to be tested. © 2017, BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."
"Airplane pilot mental health and suicidal thoughts: a cross-sectional descriptive study via anonymous web-based survey","2016","Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006064680&partnerID=40&md5=dc19b3f26c8c844a676fb300a13db4ac","Background: The Germanwings Flight 9525 crash has brought the sensitive subject of airline pilot mental health to the forefront in aviation. Globally, 350 million people suffer from depression-a common mental disorder. This study provides further information on this important topic regarding mental health especially among female airline pilots. This is the first study to describe airline pilot mental health-with a focus on depression and suicidal thoughts-outside of the information derived from aircraft accident investigations, regulated health examinations, or identifiable self-reports, which are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline companies. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study via an anonymous web-based survey administered between April and December 2015. Pilots were recruited from unions, airline companies, and airports via convenience sampling. Data analysis included calculating absolute number and prevalence of health characteristics and depression scores. Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty seven (52.7%) of the 3485 surveyed pilots completed the survey, with 1866 (53.5%) completing at least half of the survey. 233 (12.6%) of 1848 airline pilots responding to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and 193 (13.5%) of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold-PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10. Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks. We found a significant trend in proportions of depression at higher levels of use of sleep-aid medication (trend test z = 6.74, p < 0.001) and among those experiencing sexual harassment (z = 3.18, p = 0.001) or verbal harassment (z = 6.13, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Hundreds of pilots currently flying are managing depressive symptoms perhaps without the possibility of treatment due to the fear of negative career impacts. This study found 233 (12.6%) airline pilots meeting depression threshold and 75 (4.1%) pilots reporting having suicidal thoughts. Although results have limited generalizability, there are a significant number of active pilots suffering from depressive symptoms. We recommend airline organizations increase support for preventative mental health treatment. Future research will evaluate additional risk factors of depression such as sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. © 2016 The Author(s)"

Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers' urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively. Three candidate biomarkers were selected on the basis of statistical significance, coefficient of variance, and compared with data of the three groups. The results suggest that urine metabolites may provide a complete new clue from biochemistry to understand, monitor, and manage human mental fatigue. © 2016 American Chemical Society."

Background: The issues of imperfect automation in air traffic control (ATC) have been well documented in previous studies, particularly in conflict-alerting systems. The extent to which the prior findings can be applied to an integrated conflict detection and resolution system in future ATC remains unknown. Method: Twenty-four participants were evenly divided into two groups corresponding to a medium- and a high- traffic density condition, respectively. In each traffic density condition, participants were instructed to perform simulated ATC tasks under four automation conditions, including reliable, unreliable with short time allowance to secondary conflict (TAS), unreliable with long TAS, and manual conditions. Dependent variables accounted for conflict resolution performance, workload, situation awareness, and trust in and dependence on the CRA aid, respectively. Results: Imposing the CRA automation did increase performance and reduce workload as compared with manual performance. The CRA aid did not decrease situation awareness. The benefits of the CRA aid were manifest even when it was imperfectly reliable and were apparent across traffic loads. In the unreliable blocks, trust in the CRA aid was degraded but dependence was not influenced, yet the performance was not adversely affected. Conclusion: The use of CRA aid would benefit ATC operations across traffic densities. Application: CRA aid offers benefits across traffic densities, regardless of its imperfection, as long as its reliability level is set above the threshold of assistance, suggesting its application for future ATC. © Copyright 2016, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Method The voices of a group of 45 ATCs were recorded before and after a 2-hour shift, regardless of their operational position or number of previously worked shifts; both genders were included, participants had a mean age of 25 years, and they had a mean length of occupational experience of 4 years and 2 months. Each of these professionals was recorded phonating a sustained /a/ vowel and counting from 1 to 20, and the recordings were acoustically analyzed using the Praat software. A perceptual-auditory analysis of the recordings was then performed by three speech therapists specializing in voice, who evaluated the characteristics of each emission using a visual analog scale (VAS). The acoustic analysis was performed on the sustained /a/ vowel. The measures of intensity; frequency; maximum phonation time (MPT); and the first, second, third, and fourth formants were considered in this analysis. Results There were no significant differences between the random pre- and postshift samples, either in the acoustic or in the perceptual-auditory analysis. The perceptual-auditory analysis revealed that 44% (n = 20) of ATCs showed alterations in vocal quality during the sustained /a/ vowel emission, and this dysphonia was also observed in connected speech in 25% (n = 5) of this group. Conclusion Perceptual-auditory analysis of the /a/ vowel revealed that a high percentage of ATCs had vocal alterations (44%), even among a group of subjects without vocal complaints. © 2016 The Voice Foundation"

This group is at high risk of later suicide and they have a high rate of premature mortality from non-mental health conditions. The importance of this population in suicide prevention is recognised by their inclusion in most suicide prevention strategies. Efforts to address this challenge by predicting the risk of future suicide or self-harm have failed to make much impact. Indeed, such approaches have also encouraged a culture of repeat risk assessment with little emphasis on the development and implementation of effective interventions. Most people who die by suicide who have been in contact with health services are deemed to be at low risk and most high risk individuals do not die by suicide. Other industries such as commercial aviation face the same problem of trying to prevent rare but unpredictable catastrophes. However the methods used in these industries incorporates individual risk assessment into a broader systemic approach. For the population of suicidal people who present to emergency departments this would mean creating an effective system of care. Part of such a system would involve training clinicians in the identification of patients' needs as well as enhancing knowledge of modifiable risk factors in the patient. It would also mean identifying and managing risks in clinicians as well as within the system in which they are working. The system would include feedback on adherence to good process and patient outcomes. Such systems have been used successfully elsewhere in medicine such as in surgical operating theatres. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. All rights reserved."

A recent investigation evaluated measures of anxiety during centrifuge-simulated suborbital commercial spaceflight, highlighting the potential for severe anxiousness to interrupt spaceflight operations. METHODS: To pave the way for future research, an extensive literature review identified existing knowledge that may contribute to formation of interventions for anxiety in commercial spaceflight. Useful literature was identified regarding anxiety from a variety of fields, including centrifugation, fear of flying, motion sickness, and military operations. RESULTS: Fear of flying is the most extensively studied area, with some supportive evidence from centrifugation studies. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) is as effective as actual training flight exposure (or analog exposure) in mitigation of flight-related anxiety. The addition of other modalities, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback, to VRE improves desensitization compared to VRE alone. Motion sickness-susceptible individuals demonstrate higher trait anxiety than nonsusceptible individuals; for this reason, motion sickness susceptibility questionnaires may be useful measures to identify at-risk individuals. Some military studies indicate that psychiatric history and personality classification may have predictive value in future research. Medication countermeasures consisting of benzodiazepines may quell in-flight anxiety, but do not likely improve anxiety on repeat exposure. DISCUSSION: The scarce available literature addressing anxiety in unique environments indicates that training/repeated exposure may mitigate anxiety. Anxiety and personality indices may be helpful screening tools, while pharmaceuticals may be useful countermeasures when needed. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

The aerial assault on Pearl Harbor was the first time in US history that Army nurses had been on the front line of battle. Nurses quickly triaged and stabilized those who could be saved, and provided compassion and comfort to those who were dying, in an environment where the nurses were unsure of their own survival.METHODS: Traditional historical methods and a social history framework were used in this investigation. Primary sources included oral histories from the US Army Medical Department Center of History and Heritage and the State of Hawaii's website, Hawaii Aviation. Secondary sources included published books, newspaper articles, military websites, and history texts.RESULTS: Due to the limited bed capacity, Hickam Field Hospital converted to an evacuation hospital. Nurses, physicians, and medical corpsman triaged, stabilized, and transported those likely to survive, while staging the dead behind the building. The emergency room at Tripler Hospital was quickly flooded with patients from the battlefield, but the staff was able to sort patients appropriately to the wards, to the operating room, or provide comfort care as they died. At Schofield Hospital, collaboration between tireless doctors, nurses, and corpsmen was key to providing life-saving surgery and care."

The assessment of the aircraft interior noise influence on Temporary Threshold Shift is integrated as well, enabling extended research of all aspects of the physiological noise impact on pilots. Methodology defines measurable noise and pilot performance parameters in general aviation, equipment requirements, necessary laboratory conditions and subject selection criteria. The analysis of the deviation from the specified flight parameters along with Temporary Threshold Shift values at different accumulated noise doses is carried out.

PM demands can also interfere with ongoing tasks (costs). We examined the extent to which PM errors and costs were reduced in simulated ATC by providing extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with instructions that removed perceived memory requirements. Participants accepted/handed-off aircraft and detected conflicts. For the PM task, participants were required to substitute alternative actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft. In Experiment 1, when no aids were provided, PM errors and costs were not reduced by practice. When aids were provided, costs observed early in practice were eliminated with practice, but residual PM errors remained. Experiment 2 provided more limited practice with aids, but instructions that did not frame the PM task as a ""memory"" task led to high PM accuracy without costs. Attention-allocation policies that participants set based on expected PM demands were modified as individuals were increasingly exposed to reliable aids, or were given instructions that removed perceived memory requirements.

Method: Seventy general aviation (GA) pilots participated in the study. Each pilot was randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group and flew a simulated single-engine GA aircraft, initially under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The experimental group was equipped with a portable weather application during flight. We recorded measures for weather situation awareness (WSA), decision making, cognitive engagement, and distance from the aircraft to hazardous weather. Results: We found positive effects from the use of the portable weather application, with an increased WSA for the experimental group, which resulted in credibly larger route deviations and credibly greater distances to hazardous weather (≥30 dBZ cells) compared with the control group. Nevertheless, both groups flew less than 20 statute miles from hazardous weather cells, thus failing to follow current weather-avoidance guidelines. We also found a credibly higher cognitive engagement (prefrontal oxygenation levels) for the experimental group, possibly reflecting increased flight planning and decision making on the part of the pilots. Conclusion: Overall, the study outcome supports our hypothesis that portable weather displays can be used without degrading pilot performance on safety-related flight tasks, actions, and decisions as measured within the constraints of the present study. However, it also shows that an increased WSA does not automatically translate to enhanced flight behavior. Application: The study outcome contributes to our knowledge of the effect of portable weather applications on pilot behavior and decision making. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

This study examines the human risk factors associated with pilots in runway excursions, by applying a SHELLO model to categorize the human risk factors and to evaluate the importance based on the opinions of 145 airline pilots. This study integrates aviation management level expert opinions on relative weighting and improvement-achievability in order to develop four kinds of priority risk management strategies for airline pilots to reduce runway excursions. The empirical study based on experts’ evaluation suggests that the most important dimension is the liveware/pilot's core ability. From the perspective of front-line pilots, the most important risk factors are the environment, wet/containment runways, and weather issues like rain/thunderstorms. Finally, this study develops practical strategies for helping management authorities to improve major operational and managerial weaknesses so as to reduce the human risks related to runway excursions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Decompression illness (either venous or arterial) and environmental conditions (e.g., abnormal gases and pressure) are the most likely adverse effects aircrew often face. Though symptomatic aircrew personnel may occasionally require hyperbaric oxygen treatment, it is rare to require more than one treatment before returning to baseline function. Case Report: This challenging aviation case details the clinical course and discusses the salient physiological factors of an F/A-18D pilot who presented with neurological symptoms following loss of cabin pressure at altitude. Discussion: Most crucial to this discussion was the requirement for multiple hyperbaric oxygen treatments over several days due to recurrence of symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence during and after future flights cannot be estimated with accuracy. This case illustrates a degree of recurrences for neurological symptoms in aviation (hypobaric exposure to hyperbaric baseline environment) that has not previously been described. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

"How life experience shapes cognitive control strategies: The case of air traffic control training","2016","PLOS ONE","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976333353&partnerID=40&md5=e5f5a1d28de824db01f7ba2b3f62aa77","Although human flexible behavior relies on cognitive control, it would be implausible to assume that there is only one, general mode of cognitive control strategy adopted by all individuals. For instance, different reliance on proactive versus reactive control strategies could explain inter-individual variability. In particular, specific life experiences, like a highly demanding training for future Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs), could modulate cognitive control functions. A group of ATC trainees and a matched group of university students were tested longitudinally on task-switching and Stroop paradigms that allowed us to measure indices of cognitive control. The results showed that the ATCs, with respect to the control group, had substantially smaller mixing costs during long cue-target intervals (CTI) and a reduced Stroop interference effect. However, this advantage was present also prior to the training phase. Being more capable in managing multiple task sets and less distracted by interfering events suggests a more efficient selection and maintenance of task relevant information as an inherent characteristic of the ATC group, associated with proactive control. Critically, the training that the ATCs underwent improved their accuracy in general and reduced response time switching costs during short CTIs only. These results indicate a training-induced change in reactive control, which is described as a transient process in charge of stimulus-driven task detection and resolution. This experience-based enhancement of reactive control strategy denotes how cognitive control and executive functions in general can be shaped by real-life training and underlines the importance of experience in explaining inter-individual variability in cognitive functioning. © 2016 Arbula et al.

Automation has already been studied in a number of (sub-) disciplines and application fields: design, human factors, psychology, (software) engineering, aviation, health care, games. One distinguishing feature of the area we are focusing on is that in the field of interactive critical systems properties such as reliability, dependability, faulttolerance are as important as usability, user experience or overall acceptance issues. The SIG targets at two problem areas: first the engineering of the user interaction with (partly-) autonomous systems: how to design, build and assess autonomous behavior, especially in cases where there is a need to represent on the user interface both autonomous and interactive objects. An example of such integration is the representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (where no direct interaction is possible), together with aircrafts (that have to be instructed by an air traffic controller to avoid the UAV). Second the design and engineering of user interaction in general for autonomous objects/systems (for example a cruise control in a car or an autopilot in an aircraft). The goal of the SIG is to raise interest in the CHI community on the general aspects of automation and to identify a community of researchers and practitioners interested in those increasingly prominent issues of interfaces towards (semi)-autonomous systems. The expected audience should be interested in addressing the issues of integration of mainly unconnected research domains to formulate a new joint research agenda. © 2016 Authors."

Following the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 in March 2015 with pilot suicide as the probable cause, the Pilot Mental Health Working Group reconvened to review their recommendations. As a result, the working group revised the recommendations which are provided here and which were distributed worldwide. The Working Group continues to emphasize the importance of assessing and optimizing pilot mental health, while providing additional recommendations on building trust and rapport between the aeromedical examiner and the pilot, on utilizing aviation mental health and aeromedical specialists, and on the balance between medical confidentiality and risk to public safety. The working group encourages all organizations involved in flight safety to review and consider implementing these recommendations within their usual operations. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."
"The mental health of older persons after human-induced disasters: A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological data","2016","American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964556046&partnerID=40&md5=90f56b68be79e8fa270d417de0194244","Background Older people are increasingly ""in harm's way"" following human-induced disasters (HIDs). There is debate in the literature as to the relative impact of disasters on their psychological health compared with other age groups. Natural disasters and HIDs are thought to affect survivors differentially, and this may extend to older adults as a group. In the absence of existing systematic reviews, we aimed to synthesize the available evidence and conduct meta-analyses of the effects of HIDs on the psychological health of older versus younger adults. Methods A meta-analysis was conducted on papers identified through a systematic review. The primary outcomes measured were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorder, and psychological distress. Results We identified 11 papers from 10 studies on HIDs (N = 26,753), of which 8 had sufficient data for a random-effects meta-analysis. Older adults were 2.85 times less likely to experience PTSD symptoms following HID (95% CI: 1.42-5.70) when compared with younger adults. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusion Health and emergency services need to be increasingly prepared to meet the psychological needs of older people, given the global rise in the numbers of older adults affected by disasters of all kinds. Preliminary evidence suggests that old age may be a protective factor for the development of PTSD in the wake of HID. © 2016 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Suicide and murder-suicide involving aircraft","2016","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84974815686&partnerID=40&md5=7381f017b1332afdd572c9c04821d7e5","Background: This is a systematic review of suicide and homicide-suicide events involving aircraft. In aeromedical literature and in the media, these very different events are both described as pilot suicide, but in psychiatry they are considered separate events with distinct risk factors. Methods: Medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases were searched in a systematic way to obtain relevant cases. Relevant articles were searched for additional references. Results: There were 65 cases of pilot suicide and 6 cases of passengers who jumped from aircraft found. There were also 18 cases of homicide-suicide found involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to nonaviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%). Discussion: Homicide-suicide events occur extremely rarely. However, their impact in terms of the proportion of deaths is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after by media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."
"A novel treatment of fear of flying using a large virtual reality system","2016","Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84974806702&partnerID=40&md5=79b1ed37e151cbd46d550cd32799bd8e","Background: Fear of flying (FoF), a common phobia in the developed world, is usually treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, most efficiently when combined with exposure methods, e.g., virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). We evaluated FoF treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements simulating, e.g., takeoff, landing, and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli were also incorporated. Case Report: Three male patients with FoF underwent a clinical interview followed by three VRETs in the presence and with the guidance of a therapist. Scores on the Flight Anxiety Situation (FAS) and Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires were obtained on the first and fourth visits. Anxiety levels were assessed using the subjective units of distress (SUDs) scale during the exposure. All three subjects expressed satisfaction regarding the procedure and did not skip or avoid any of its stages. Consistent improvement was seen in the SUDs throughout the VRET session and across sessions, while patients ' scores on the FAS and FAM showed inconsistent trends. Two patients participated in actual flights in the months following the treatment, bringing 12 and 16 yr of avoidance to an end. Discussion: This VR-based treatment includes critical elements for exposure of flying experience beyond visual and auditory stimuli. The current case reports suggest VRET sessions may have a meaningful impact on anxiety levels, yet additional research seems warranted. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

The aim of the present study was to examine whether EI would predict Assessment Center (AC) ratings of job-relevant competencies in a sample of applicants for the position of a flight attendant. Applicants' ability to regulate emotions predicted performance in group exercises. However, there were inconsistent effects of applicants' ability to understand emotions: Whereas the ability to understand emotions had a positive effect on performance in interview and role play, the effect on performance in group exercises was negative. We suppose that the effect depends on task type and conclude that tests of emotional abilities should be used judiciously in personnel selection procedures. © 2016 Herpertz et al.

Methods. - The sample was divided into two groups: 67 flight attendants and 67 persons in various jobs .Our sampling units were informed and consented to fill in two questionnaires: the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI) and the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ II).Results. - The burnout syndrome affected both groups equally. It affected equally the women as well as men, whatever their age categories and their years of experience. The flight attendants occupying an intermediate position in the hierarchy had the highest score on the burnout syndrome. The psychosocial factors significantly found in flight attendants compared to the control group were: demands for hiding emotions, quantitative demands, emotional demands, temporal demands, lack of influence at work, of rewards, of possibility for development and variation of work, poor quality of leadership, exposure to sexual harassment, lack of social support from supervisors, colleagues, social community at work and work-family conflict. Four of them correlated positively with the development of burnout: quantitative demands, temporal demands, emotional demands and work-family conflict. Their expected work volume is very high (quantitative demands). They have to perform their tasks quickly in a limited time without forgetting the technical constraints (temporal demands). They have to work with an average of three hundred passengers besides colleagues and subordinates, which requires diligent control of the emotions promoted by the airline code of conduct based on repression of emotions (emotional demands). These demands affect the workers once they find themselves in their family environment and can have a negative effect on their private life (work-family conflict). However, the predictability seems to allow them to be aware of decisions and changes and protect them against burnout. Conclusion. - The profession of flight attendants appears to be characterized by some psychosocial risk factors, some of which are positively correlated with burnout. Improved working conditions can prevent these risks and protect these employees from burnout. © 2015 L'Encéphale, Paris."

Elderberries have been used traditionally, and in some observational and clinical studies, as supportive agents against the common cold and influenza. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of 312 economy class passengers travelling from Australia to an overseas destination aimed to investigate if a standardised membrane filtered elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) extract has beneficial effects on physical, especially respiratory, and mental health. Cold episodes, cold duration and symptoms were noted in a daily diary and assessed using the Jackson score. Participants also completed three surveys containing questions regarding upper respiratory symptoms (WURSS-21) and quality of life (SF-12) at baseline, just before travel and at 4-days after travel. Most cold episodes occurred in the placebo group (17 vs. 12), however the difference was not significant (p = 0.4). Placebo group participants had a significantly longer duration of cold episode days (117 vs. 57, p = 0.02) and the average symptom score over these days was also significantly higher (583 vs. 247, p = 0.05). These data suggest a significant reduction of cold duration and severity in air travelers. More research is warranted to confirm this effect and to evaluate elderberry’s physical and mental health benefits. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

A systematic review was undertaken to identify the evidence of the impact of transmeridian travel on people with mood disorders. Methods: Databases search included the following: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and manual searching using the keywords jetlag, transmeridian travel, circadian rhythm disruption, mood disorder, bipolar, major depression, seasonal affective disorder, depression, mania and hypomania. Results: Only three studies were identified that related to transmeridian travel and jetlag in people with mood disorders. There is some suggestion that transmeridian travel does appear to precipitate mood episodes with an increased rate of episodes of depression with westward compared with an increased rate of manic/hypomanic episodes with eastward travel. Individuals with a previous history of mood disorder appear to be more vulnerable if adherence to medication is compromised. Conclusion: Given the limited evidence that transmeridian travel precipitates mood episodes, this poses difficulties in identifying suitable ways to mitigate the effects of transmeridian travel in mood disorders. However, in the absence of mood-specific guidelines, some guidance can be given based on our current understanding of the relevance of circadian disruption to both jetlag and mood disorders. Further research is required to identify more focused strategies to mitigate the impact of transmeridian travel for individuals with mood disorders. © 2015 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists."

The Department of Defense's Military Health System (MHS) is one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, serving approximately 9.2 million active duty service members, retirees, spouses, and children. The annual cost to the MHS for morbidities associated with being overweight exceeds $1 billion. The preschool age has been suggested as an opportune time to intervene for the prevention of obesity. Thus, this study investigated the current level of technology usage by military service member families and assessed their needs and interests in health/nutrition information. This needs assessment is crucial for researchers/educators to design further studies and intervention programs for obesity prevention in military families with young children. Materials and Methods: In total, 288 military parents (233 Army and 55 Air Force) at two military bases whose children were enrolled in military childcare centers in the southwestern United States participated in a Technology Usage in Military Family (TUMF) survey in 2013. Results and Conclusions: Overall, both bases presented similar technology usage patterns in terms of computer and mobile device usage on the Internet. Air Force base parents had a slightly higher knowledge level of nutrition/health information than Army base parents. The TUMF survey suggested practical ways such as mobile applications/Web sites, social networks, games, etc., that health educators can use to disseminate nutrition/health information for obesity prevention among military families with young children. © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016."

Mood and complex cognition were assessed. Analysis of variance indicated that mood (fatigue and vigour) remained the same at 8000 ft but fatigue was increased (p = 0.001) and vigour reduced (p = 0.035) at 12,000 ft and was restored by supplementary oxygen. Complex cognition was not significantly altered by the test conditions. The results of this study do not support prior evidence that mild hypoxia equivalent to either 8000 or 12,000 ft, impairs complex cognition, but suggests that some aspects of mood may be affected at 12,000 ft and can be restored by breathing 100% oxygen. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society."

However, because USAF RPA pilots initially train in manned aircraft, validation of aptitude and traits predictive of RPA pilot success has thus far been limited to RPA pilot training outcomes that actually require manned flight. Hence, thus far, there has been no basis for determining the aptitudes and traits predictive of success in environments in which pilots actually fly RPAs. To address this gap, the present study evaluated preaccession trait (Big Five personality domains) and aptitude (spatial, quantitative, and aviation knowledge) measures as predictors of manned and unmanned aircraft pilot performance on-the-job, as measured by supervisor and senior rater stratification on 3 years of Officer Performance Reports (OPRs). Results were generally consistent in showing that the same aptitudes, knowledge, and personality traits that predict successful job performance for manned aircraft pilots also predict successful job performance for RPA pilots. However, results also showed preaccession aviation knowledge to be a stronger predictor of job performance for RPA pilots than for manned aircraft pilots. These findings and their implications for attracting and selecting RPA pilots are discussed."

Naturally there are certain occupational groups where human factors and/or mental illness could impair safety and mental acuity, and with potentially devastating consequences. For pilots, the medical criteria for crew licensing are stipulated by regulatory aviation authorities worldwide, and these include specific mental illness exclusions. The challenge of assessment for mental health problems is, however, complex and the responsibility for psychological screening and testing falls to a range of different specialists and groups including AMEs (authorised aviation medical examiners), GPs and physicians, airline human resources departments, psychologists, human factor specialists and pilots themselves. Extending and developing the ideas of Aviation Mental Health (2006), which described a range of psychological issues and problems that may affect pilots and the consequences of these, this book presents an authoritative, comprehensive and practical guide to modern, evidence-based practice in the field of mental health assessment, treatment and care. It features contributions from experts in the field drawn from several countries, professions and representing a range of aviation-related organisations, displaying a range of different skills and methods that can be used for the clinical assessment of pilots and in relation to specific mental-health problems and syndromes. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Robert Bor, Carina Eriksen, Margaret Oakes and Peter Scragg."

Although ‘cross-disciplinary' in this context represents the admirable aim to use all available knowledge to enhance safety, even the field of human factors has to outline the limitations of itself as a field of science. Such limitations may be constructive in defining human factors as an academic field, but may in practice also have the effect of excluding important influences on human performance which fall outside of these limitations. Recent aviation accidents and incidents related to mental health issues have revealed what seems to be an exclusion of the field of mental health in human factors and thus in the understanding of pilot performance. The resulting rift has roots that need to be understood and bridged to ensure and enhance the current level of safety in the aviation industry. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Robert Bor, Carina Eriksen, Margaret Oakes and Peter Scragg."

The application of human sciences to aviation (in order to avoid error) was firmly established well before CRM training was conceived. Work in the 1940s and 1950s by scientists such as Norman Mackworth, Paul Fitts, Alphonse Chapanis and John Flanagan helped to establish the idea that aviation design and practice should consider human capability and limitations. The improvements generated during this classic period of human-centred work are still apparent today and undoubtedly form a first line of defence against human error. A classic example of that work is the placement and shapes of undercarriage and flap levers, intended to reduce confusion and subsequent human error slips. Although established over 70 years ago it can still be seen in all modern air transport aircraft. As well as design principle, areas focusing on ‘the person’ such as selection and training also benefited from an increased use of human science research and human-engineering (the practice of applying human sciences such as psychology and physiology to operational environments, now more widely known as human factors). Early uses of this approach often focused on human traits and characteristics. Early work by John Flanagan attempted, through qualitative methods, to discover the characteristics and behaviours typical of unsuccessful pilot trainees, with a view to improving selection (Flanagan 1954). Hence, human-centred approaches were used to improve aviation safety and reduce error, long before the implementation of CRM training. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Since 1981, the biennial International Symposium on Aviation Psychology (ISAP) has been convened for the purposes of (a) presenting the latest research on human performance problems and opportunities within aviation systems, (b) envisioning design solutions that best utilize human capabilities for creating safe and efficient aviation systems, and (c) bringing together scientists, research sponsors, and operators in an effort to bridge the gap between research and application. Though rooted in the presentations of the 17th ISAP, held in 2013 in Dayton, Ohio, Advances in Aviation Psychology is not simply a collection of selected proceeding papers. Based upon the potential impact on emerging trends, current debates or enduring issues present in their work, select authors were invited to expand on their work following the benefit of interactions at the symposium. The invited authors include the featured keynote and plenary speakers who are all leading scientists and prominent researchers that were selected to participate at the symposium. These contributions are supplemented by additional contributors whose work best reflects significant developments in aviation psychology. Consequently the volume includes visions for the next generation of air management and air traffic control, the integration of unmanned (i.e. remotely piloted vehicles) into operational air spaces, and the use of advanced information technologies (e.g. synthetic task environments) for research and training. This book is the first in a series of volumes to be published in conjunction with each subsequent ISAP. The aim of each volume is not only to report the latest findings in aviation psychology but also to suggest new directions for advancing the field. © 2014 Michael A. Vidulich, Pamela s.

It can be described succinctly as “investigating an accident before it happens.” A hazard is selected, such as two aircraft violating minimum separation standards or an aircraft losing sufficient lift to maintain altitude, and then the scenarios that can lead to that hazardous state are identified. Hazards are informally defined here as precursor states to accidents that the designer never wants the system to get into purposely. The resulting scenarios or potential paths to the hazard are then used to compute the probability of the hazardous state occurring or to design to either eliminate the scenarios or to control or mitigate them. Alternatively, after an accident, hazard analysis techniques can generate the potential scenarios to assist accident investigators in determining the most likely cause. © 2014 Michael A.

It has been reasonably effective in understanding, and predicting, many aspects of pilot aptitude and ability. However, predicting safe and effective behaviour based on pilots' personality data has proved more elusive. Furthermore there currently exists an understandable inclination in aviation organisations to favour personality ‘testing' and screening in or screening out individuals on the basis of their personality profiles. An additional and somewhat noisy factor is the large commercial industry of psychometrics with thousands of variations of personality questionnaires available, each proclaiming to accurately and reliably measure or ‘test' personality. It has been estimated that this industry is worth somewhere between $2 billion and $4 billion per year (The Economist, 2013). © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Robert Bor, Carina Eriksen, Margaret Oakes and Peter Scragg."

In recognition of the role miscommunications play in aviation incidents and accidents, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recently introduced language proficiency requirements for all flight personnel in all ICAO member states. Using an effective and economical experimental paradigm, the research described here teases apart the complex combination of factors (e.g. speech rate, controller message length, English language proficiency, cognitive workload) believed to contribute to miscommunications between controllers and pilots. Misunderstandings in ATC Communication offers an in-depth report of a seminal study in aviation communication, which until now has only been available in the form of an unpublished dissertation. In addition, it offers a recent extension of that work, the authors' reflections on the research process, and a thorough review of the aviation communication literature. Graduate students and researchers who wish to address real-world problems will appreciate the simple elegance of the experimental paradigm that has been used to address a wide range of theoretical and applied interdisciplinary research questions.

"Psychophysiological sensing and state classification for attention management in commercial aviation","2016","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088353199&partnerID=40&md5=e9f95ace808844bdc87cfb641c536941","Attention-related human performance limiting states (AHPLS) can cause pilots to lose airplane state awareness (ASA), and their detection is important to improving commercial aviation safety. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team found that the majority of recent international commercial aviation accidents attributable to loss of control inflight involved flight crew loss of airplane state awareness, and that distraction of various forms was involved in all of them. Research on AHPLS, including channelized attention, diverted attention, startle/surprise, and confirmation bias, has been recommended in a Safety Enhancement (SE) entitled “Training for Attention Management.” To accomplish the detection of such cognitive and psychophysiological states, a broad suite of sensors has been implemented to simultaneously measure their physiological markers during high fidelity flight simulation human subject studies. Pilot participants were asked to perform benchmark tasks and experimental flight scenarios designed to induce AHPLS. Pattern classification was employed to discriminate the AHPLS induced by the benchmark tasks. Unimodal classification using pre-processed electroencephalography (EEG) signals as input features to extreme gradient boosting, random forest and deep neural network multi-state classifiers was implemented. Multi-modal classification using galvanic skin response (GSR) in addition to the same EEG signals and using the same types of classifiers produced increased accuracy with respect to the unimodal case (90% vs. 86%), although only via the deep neural network classifier. Using EEG, GSR and heart rate variability across five participants, multi-state prediction accuracy averaged 89%. These initial results are a first step toward the goal of demonstrating simultaneous real time classification of multiple states using multiple sensing modalities in high-fidelity flight simulators. This detection is intended to support and inform training methods under development to mitigate the loss of ASA and thus reduce accidents and incidents. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

"Promoting good psychological health amongst pilots: Coping strategies for identifying and managing stress to reduce the risk of mental health problems and improve performance at work","2016","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058600586&partnerID=40&md5=ed692943a5739fbe2c59130270cfa372","Psychological problems within the pilot population are an insidious threat to safety because of impairments to task performance. The FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) guide for AME's (aviation medical examiners) includes specific requirements with regard to the psychiatric assessment and medical exclusions for mental health problems and these are very similar to the criteria stipulated by most other regulatory authorities worldwide. Severe psychological disturbance among pilots is rare but just as in other occupational groups, they may, however, suffer from a range of psychological difficulties which may be mild to moderate in severity and in most cases be transient and treatable (Bor and Hubbard, 2006; Bor et al., 2002; Elliot, 2013). As is the case with many mental health conditions, shame associated with social stigma and failure to access timely and appropriate treatment may increase the severity and duration of symptoms, thereby potentially leading to more serious and possibly intractable psychiatric problems. The prevention of mental health problems and reduction of stigma in the workplace associated with mental illness must be a priority in aviation.

The relationship between measures of personality and success in ATCS training is less clear. An area of concern is that personality tests are susceptible to faking and that job applicants may respond in a socially desirable manner to increase their odds of being hired (Paulhus, 2002). Personality measures that use a multidimensional pairwise preference item format tend to be fake-resistant (Underhill, Bearden, & Chen, 2008), leading to renewed interest in the use of personality assessments in personnel hiring. We report an initial assessment of one such measure, the Tailored Adaptive Personality Assessment System-Federal Aviation Administration for predicting success of ATCS trainees in Academy training.

The study allows estimating whether the paratroopers exposed to high level of mental stress are simultaneously under severe oxidative stress. Methods. The investigations were carried out on 46 professional soldiers from airborne forces divided into groups depending on the number of performed parachute jumps. Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained under fasting conditions three times for the determination of selected parameters of red-ox balance: on an ordinary working day, on the day when the jump was performed and on the day after the jump. The time of the performed determinations was to refect the initial balance of the organism, the state at the moment of stress and its efect on the organism. Results. Our investigations showed lack of differences in characteristics of the activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD) in response to mental stress depending on the experience of the investigated group in parachuting. Decrease in GSH-Px activity was demonstrated in response to mental stress in all the investigated groups. The TBARS level was higher in more experienced parachutists. Conclusions. The analysis of changes in selected redox balance parameters may be useful for monitoring anxiety associated with parachute jumps. Slowa klucze: lek, stres oksydacyjny, skoki spadochronowe."
"Medical astrosociology and space medicine: Bringing together the two branches of science","2016","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007564270&partnerID=40&md5=89c64a73947f64949687c87fca8d0c36","Fundamentally, the social and behavioral sciences, humanities, and the arts dominate astrosociology. However, collaboration with the space-related natural and physical sciences also plays a crucial role in understanding space issues from a holistic perspective. This paper examines the potential links between the social sciences (that includes all of the “soft” sciences for brevity) and the physical/natural sciences. This unification of the two branches constitutes what is termed medical astrosociology. It does not delve into the biomedical issues directly, which is the realm of space medicine, but it does provide linkages between these issues and those related to the social sciences. While space medicine is valuable in itself, behavioral health has recently emphasized a much more inclusive approach, and medical astrosociology brings in the social and behavioral sciences into the mix, along with the humanities-something that is too often missing. The approach medical astrosociology takes has a long history within sociology and anthropology. The two extra facets-social and cultural forces - have implications for behavior beyond what physiology and psychology alone can explain. Because astrosociology is the study of astrosocial phenomena, which include the social, cultural, and behavioral patterns related to outer space, medical astrosociology covers the human dimension that becomes the target of inquiry on multiple levels: (1) physiology, (2) psychology, (3) society (including social forces), and (4) culture. In other words, medical astrosociology focuses on how space medicine is practiced (the physical) within the social, cultural, and mental dimensions in which the patient, third parties such as family members, and practitioners all live. It is quite clear that the best course of action medically is not always allowed to occur due to impediments that often have no direct relationship to the strictly medical decision making process. Sometimes, for example, ethical dilemmas force compromises by both the doctor and the patient. It occurs on Earth, so it will occur in space ecosystems, which often present additional unique challenges to the practice of space medicine. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

"The illustrated road to the modern airliner, 1915-1940: The first commercial-aircraft market battle between Boeing and Douglas","2016","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007454217&partnerID=40&md5=919483af2000aff0c9517e8e0bac4fc3","As Dr. John D. Anderson describes in his book, The Airplane: A History of Its Technology, the decade of the 1930s brought the first design revolution to the mature, propeller-driven airplane. The decade saw advances in propulsion, with air-cooled radial engines; advances in structures, with streamlined metal airframes and retractable landing gear; improved airfield performance, with wing lift and -drag devices; and improved aircraft systems, providing better operational efficiency while improving crew and passenger safety. From this revolution came the introduction, in 1933, of the all-metal, streamlined Boeing Model 247, followed closely by the Douglas DC-1 and DC-2. The modern airliner was born. Clearly, no single person or organization invented the modern airliner. However, using Dr. Richard P. Hallion's model, “The Aerospace Design Process as a Way to Describe Emulations, Innovations and Inventions, this paper will examine the main people and technical events that influenced the Boeing and Douglas designs. Charles Lindbergh’s solo, transatlantic flight in May of 1927 had an immediate worldwide effect on the aviation industry. The flight stimulated that industry, bringing increased focus on research and development, and on newaircraft development, and it made major financial investment available to the aircraft manufacturers. The market demanded better commercial aircraft. The timing was then right for manufacturers to take risks and push the state of the art in their designs for new aircraft. Balancing the need to go farther, faster, and higher with the ability to carry more payload at optimum efficiency was the goal. The investment risk for these next-generation aircraft designs was motivated not just by a desire for return on investment, but also to ensure survival in the tough, competitive commercial air-transportation business for the foreseeable future. This paper is not a new history of the Boeing Model 247 or the Douglas DC-1/DC-2, but is intended to be a side-by-side case study that examines what aviation historians often call “The World’s First Modern Airliners.” The paper will focus on how the respective companies’ leadership approached their design, engineering, and manufacturing challenges in order to bring these two aircraft to the marketplace with a favorable, long-term competitive advantage. As history has shown in the case of Boeing’s Model 247, the Boeing approach did not have long-term success. The Douglas approach, by contrast, resulted in an iconic aircraft: the Douglas DC-3. This paper will investigate why the two companies’ design approaches differed. The paper will also examine the political, social, and operational requirements, as well as the personalities that drove the final configuration of both aircraft. In addition, the paper will review the role of government and the government regulations that helped to simulate aviation technology - and to create some unnecessary obstacles. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

We reported on brain-to-brain cooperative interactions between civil pilots during a simulated flight. We demonstrated for the first time how the combination of neuroelectrical hyperscanning and intersubject connectivity could provide indicators sensitive to the humans' degree of synchronization under a highly demanding task performed in an ecological environment. Our results showed how intersubject connectivity was able to i) characterize the degree of cooperation between pilots in different phases of the flight, and ii) to highlight the role of specific brain macro areas in cooperative behavior. During the most cooperative flight phases pilots showed, in fact, dense patterns of interbrain connectivity, mainly linking frontal and parietal brain areas. On the contrary, the amount of interbrain connections went close to zero in the non-cooperative phase. The reliability of the interbrain connectivity patterns was verified by means of a baseline condition represented by formal couples, i.e. pilots paired offline for the connectivity analysis but not simultaneously recorded during the flight. Interbrain density was, in fact, significantly higher in real couples with respect to formal couples in the cooperative flight phases. All the achieved results demonstrated how the description of brain networks at the basis of cooperation could effectively benefit from a hyperscanning approach. Interbrain connectivity was, in fact, more informative in the investigation of cooperative behavior with respect to established EEG signal processing methodologies applied at a single subject level. © 2016 Toppi et al.

These issues were addressed by (1) developing dynamic areas of interests (AOIs) in the form of either convex or rectangular shapes to represent the moving and shape-changing multielement objects, (2) introducing the concept of AOI gap tolerance (AGT) that controls the size of the AOIs to address the overlapping and visual angle error issues, and (3) finding a near optimal AGT value. The approach was tested in the context of air traffic control (ATC) operations where air traffic controller specialists (ATCSs) interrogated multiple moving aircraft on a radar display to detect and control the aircraft for the purpose of maintaining safe and expeditious air transportation. In addition, we show how eye tracking analysis results can differ based on how we define dynamic AOIs to determine eye fixations on moving objects.

Despite the fact that teachers are aware of the importance of tolerance, they do not perform focused actions on formation and development of tolerance in teenage school children. The purpose of the research was to study and diagnose tolerance in children of secondary school age, as well as to develop and implement programs aimed at the formation of tolerance in adolescents. In compliance with the goal, the following methods have been selected: theoretical (study and analysis of psycho-pedagogical and methodological literature on the study, comparison, generalization), empirical (ascertaining, forming, and control experiment), diagnostic techniques “Properties of a tolerant person”, “Tolerant personality traits”, “Methods of tolerant behavior diagnosis”. These methods allowed diagnosing increasing knowledge about tolerance and awareness of tolerant behavior in adolescents. The experiment involved 50 teenagers of Kazan Aviation Physics and Mathematics Lyceum №145. There was used the complex of diagnostic techniques for tolerance determination: “Properties of a tolerant person”. “Tolerant personality traits”, “Methods of tolerant behavior diagnosis”. On the basis of the results of ascertaining experiment there was developed the program containing forms and methods of personal tolerance formation in teenage students. Statistical analysis of empirical research was carried out by means of standard techniques of mathematical statistics (Student’s t-test, Wilcoxon matched pairs test, G signed rank test, Pearson correlation coefficient).

Researchers utilized a survey to gain a clearer understanding of participant perceptions pertaining to fatigue. Survey items consisted of the following constructs: subjective fatigue, sleep quality, working factors, daily life factors, and personality. The results indicated that sleep quality and workload were major issues that caused the feeling of fatigue in the air traffic controllers surveyed. It is noticeable that daily life impact also contributed to the controller’s fatigue. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

The passive brain–computer interface (p-BCI) systems allow to improve the human–machine interaction (HMI) in operational environments, by using the covert brain activity (eg, mental workload) of the operator. However, p-BCI technology could suffer from some practical issues when used outside the laboratories. In particular, one of the most important limitations is the necessity to recalibrate the p-BCI system each time before its use, to avoid a significant reduction of its reliability in the detection of the considered mental states. The objective of the proposed study was to provide an example of p-BCIs used to evaluate the users’ mental workload in a real operational environment. For this purpose, through the facilities provided by the École Nationale de l'Aviation Civile of Toulouse (France), the cerebral activity of 12 professional air traffic control officers (ATCOs) has been recorded while performing high realistic air traffic management scenarios. By the analysis of the ATCOs’ brain activity (electroencephalographic signal—EEG) and the subjective workload perception (instantaneous self-assessment) provided by both the examined ATCOs and external air traffic control experts, it has been possible to estimate and evaluate the variation of the mental workload under which the controllers were operating. The results showed (i) a high significant correlation between the neurophysiological and the subjective workload assessment, and (ii) a high reliability over time (up to a month) of the proposed algorithm that was also able to maintain high discrimination accuracies by using a low number of EEG electrodes (~ 3 EEG channels). In conclusion, the proposed methodology demonstrated the suitability of p-BCI systems in operational environments and the advantages of the neurophysiological measures with respect to the subjective ones. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Additionally, terminologies and methods are lacking to accurately characterize the eye tracking data into simplified visual scanning strategies linguistically expressed by ATCs. As an intermediate step to automate the characterization classification process, we (1) defined and developed new concepts to systematically filter complex visual scanpaths into simpler and more manageable forms and (2) developed procedures to map visual scanpaths with linguistic inputs to reduce the human judgement bias during interrater agreement. The developed concepts and procedures were applied to investigating the visual scanpaths of expert ATCs using scenarios with different aircraft congestion levels. Furthermore, oculomotor trends were analyzed to identify the influence of aircraft congestion on scan time and number of comparisons among aircraft. The findings show that (1) the scanpaths filtered at the highest intensity led to more consistent mapping with the ATCs' linguistic inputs, (2) the pattern classification occurrences differed between scenarios, and (3) increasing aircraft congestion caused increased scan times and aircraft pairwise comparisons. The results provide a foundation for better characterizing complex scanpaths in a dynamic task and automating the analysis process. © 2016 Sarah N. McClung and Ziho Kang."

The importance of both organisational issues and human factor issues at a more personal level including tiredness, the effect of emotions and the role of situational awareness, needs to be understood by all those involved in healthcare.

This longitudinal study aims to investigate (1) the proportion of survivors of the airplane crash showing a probable posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) or depressive disorder, and (2) whether symptoms of PTSD and depression were predicted by trauma characteristics. Identifying these trauma characteristics is crucial for early detection and treatment. Of the 121 adult survivors, 82 participated in this study 2 months after the crash and 76 participated 9 months after the crash. Risk for PTSD and depression was measured with the self-report instruments Trauma Screening Questionnaire and Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Trauma characteristics assessed were Injury Severity Score (ISS), hospitalisation, length of hospital stay, and seating position in the plane. Two months after the crash, 32 participants (of N = 70, 46%) were at risk for PTSD and 28 (of N = 80, 32%) were at risk for depression. Nine months after the crash, 35 participants (of N = 75, 47%) were at risk for PTSD and 24 (of N = 76, 35%) were at risk for depression. There was a moderate correlation between length of hospital stay and symptoms of PTSD and depression 9 months after the crash (r =.33 and r =.45, respectively). There were no differences in seating position between participants at high risk vs. participants at low risk for PTSD or depression. Mixed design ANOVAs showed also no association between the course of symptoms of PTSD and depression 2 and 9 months after the crash and ISS or hospitalisation. This suggests that health care providers need to be aware that survivors may be at risk for PTSD or depression, regardless of the objective severity of their physical injuries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For airlines, the delivery of the pre-flight safety briefing prior to a commercial flight is not only an opportunity to inform passengers about the safety features on-board the aircraft they are flying, but an opportunity to positively influence their mood, and hence performance in the unlikely event of an emergency. The present research examined whether indeed the pre-flight safety briefing could be used to positively impact passengers' mood. In addition, the present research examined whether the recall of key safety messages contained within the pre-flight safety briefing was influenced by the style of briefing. Eighty-two participants were recruited for the research and divided into three groups; each group exposed to a different pre-flight cabin safety briefing video (standard, humorous, movie theme). Mood was measured prior and post safety briefing. The results revealed that pre-flight safety briefing videos can be used to manipulate passengers' mood. Safety briefings that are humorous or use movie themes to model their briefing were found to positively affect mood. However, there was a trade-off between entertainment and education, the greater the entertainment value, the poorer the retention of key safety messages.

The human body adapts to shiftwork differently. These adjustments affect the health-disease process, predisposing ATC to risk conditions associated with sleep deprivation and lack of night sleep, which can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, anxiety, and obesity. This study investigated the characteristics of health, sleep, and quality of life of ATC exposed to 8-h alternate work shifts and 6-h rotational work shifts. Methods: The study was cross-sectional with convenience samples consisting of 84 ATC from two international airports in Brazil. We applied questionnaires to collect data about socioeconomic conditions, quality of life, sleep, and physical activity levels. We also collected health data regarding nutritional status, body composition, and blood pressure. We analyzed the differences between ATC from the two airports considering the variables of sleep, quality of life, and health. Results: Differences were found between the groups in terms of body fat percentage (30.7% and 27.8%), scores of overall quality of life (56.2 and 68), concentration (3.37 and 3.96), energy (3.12 and 3.62), and sleep time on working days (5:20 h and 6:15 h). Conclusion: ATC under 8-h alternate shifts showed lower scores for quality of life, higher body fat, and less sleep time on working days, which characterizes inadequate shiftwork for this population. © 2015.

Various studies have addressed anticipatory and predictive cognitive processes distinctly in situations with slow and rapid dynamics. Their results indicate a need for effective anticipation, which contributes to reducing cognitive load while preserving optimal performance. Commercial aviation is dynamic environment in which safety stakes are high. Helping pilots to better anticipate constitutes a major challenge that the ASAP (Anticipation Support for Aeronautical Planning) project addresses. Flying a plane during landing phase has the particularity of implying both short-term anticipation (managing flight variables) and long-term anticipation (managing the flight path and getting ready to the landing). One early question raised by the cognitive psychology field is about the relationship between anticipatory time depth and cognitive load. In order to offer a tool providing information to help pilots better anticipate, this issue must be dealt with. In a simulated civil aviation setting, we implemented an experiment in order to investigate the relationship between anticipatory time depth - The time between the moment when information is presented and the moment when it is used - And how cognitive load evolves at a predetermined level of control. We chose to investigate a civil aviation setting where the tasks to be performed have fixed terms defined by flight procedures and the dynamics of the aircraft. This means that subjects can prepare to take action (anticipation by preparation for action), but they cannot pro-act (anticipation by pro-action). Cognitive load is also assessed. It is also expected to observe an ""optimal time depth"", i.e. a ""time depth beyond which the information-processing-inducedoverload is not compensated by what this information adds to the representation of the situation"". To address the hypotheses stated above we chose ""radar"" type guidance, i.e. guidance for instrument flight where the subject enters instructions relating to altitude, speed and heading into the autopilot which does not require any particular technical skills to be mastered. The results are presented as well as the ergonomics and knowledge management approaches implemented in order to design the experimental setup. The appearance of a cognitive compromise is highlighted and discussed. Conclusions are drawn from the results in order to design an effective anticipation support for pilots. © Presses Universitaires de France. Tous droits réservés pour tous pays."

According to emotional processing theory, the success of exposure therapy is predicted by activation of subjective and physiological fear responses and their within-session habituation and between-session adaptation. This study tested this prediction for aviophobia. Methods Seventy-nine participants following a highly standardized treatment program for aviophobia provided self-reported and physiological (heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period) measurements of fear activation, within-session habituation, and between-session adaptation during exposure to flight-related stimuli, a flight simulator, and during two real flights. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine whether these measurements predicted therapy outcome up to 3 years after finishing therapy, including number of flights flown in this period. Results Both subjective and physiological arousal measurements indicated strong fear activation and large within-session habituation and between-session adaptation during exposure. Flight anxiety measures showed large improvements up to 3 years after treatment (η2 between 0.72 and 0.91). Lower self-reported anxiety during flight exposure was associated with lower flight anxiety after exposure (R2 = 0.15) and more flights flown (R2 = 0.14). Within-flight habituation or between-session adaptation of self-reported anxiety had no relationship with treatment outcome. Within-flight habituation of HR reactivity (R2 = 0.10) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (R2 = 0.11) was associated with lower flight anxiety directly after the flight, but not on flight anxiety 3 years after finishing therapy or on long-term flying behavior. Conclusions The results provide only weak support for emotional processing theory. Low self-reported anxiety during in vivo flight exposure was the best predictor of successful long-term therapy outcome. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Simultaneously, we are social beings. Accordingly, our internal circadian timings experience interference from externally determined factors such as work schedules and social engagements, and digital connectivity imports additional social constraints that can further misalign our individual body clocks. Misalignment between biological and social time causes social jet lag [50], which has serious physical and mental health consequences. It particularly impacts our sleep processes and neurobehavioral functioning. Examining the interplay between biological rhythms and technologymediated social interactions, we find that technology may both modulate and reflect circadian rhythms. We also leverage such social-sensor data to infer sleep-related behaviors and disruptions and to analyze variations in attention, cognitive performance, and mood following (in)adequate sleep. We conclude with recommendations for designing technologies attuned to our innate biological traits. © © 2015 ACM."

Prior training and cognitive ability may impact practice and interval effects on real-world tasks. In this study, we took advantage of existing practice data from 5 simulated flights among 263 middle-aged and older pilots with varying levels of flight expertise (defined by U.S. Federal Aviation Administration proficiency ratings). We developed a new Simultaneous Time Effects on Practice (STEP) model: (a) to model the simultaneous effects of practice and interval on performance of the 5 flights, and (b) to examine the effects of selected covariates (i.e., age, flight expertise, and 3 composite measures of cognitive ability). The STEP model demonstrated consistent positive practice effects, negative interval effects, and predicted covariate effects. Age negatively moderated the beneficial effects of practice. Additionally, cognitive processing speed and intraindividual variability (IIV) in processing speed moderated the benefits of practice and/or the negative influence of interval for particular flight performance measures. Expertise did not interact with practice or interval. Results indicated that practice and interval effects occur in simulated flight tasks. However, processing speed and IIV may influence these effects, even among high-functioning adults.

We suggest that, at the sector level, air traffic showing a centralised network pattern can provide cognitive benefits in visual search and resolution decision which will in turn result in lower workload. We found that the network centralisation index can account for more variance in predicting perceived workload and task completion time in both a static conflict detection task (Study 1) and a dynamic one (Study 2) in addition to other aircraft-level and pair-level factors. This finding suggests that linear combination of aircraft-level or dyad-level information may not be adequate and the global-pattern-based index is necessary.

Effective HSI incorporates several domains, including manpower, personnel and training, human factors, environment, safety, occupational health, habitability, survivability, logistics, intelligence, mobility, and command and control. To achieve effective HSI, the relationships among these domains must be considered. Although this integrated approach is well documented, there are many instances where it is not followed. Human factors engineers typically focus on system design with little attention to the skills, abilities, and other characteristics needed by human operators. When problems with fielded systems occur, additional training of personnel is developed and conducted. Personnel selection is seldom considered during the HSI process. Complex systems such as aviation require careful selection of the individuals who will interact with the system. Personnel selection is a two-stage process involving select-in and select-out procedures. Select-in procedures determine which candidates have the aptitude to profit from training and represent the best investment. Select-out procedures focus on medical qualification and determine who should not enter training for medical reasons. The current paper discusses the role of personnel selection in the HSI process in the context of remotely piloted aircraft systems. © 2015. Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

However, this contention has not been tested in truly stressful environments with highly skilled individuals. Furthermore, the effect of challenge and threat responses on attentional control during visuomotor tasks is poorly understood. Design: Thus, this study aimed to examine individual reactions to stress and their influence on attentional control, among a cohort of commercial pilots performing a stressful flight assessment. Methods: Sixteen pilots performed an “engine failure on take-off” scenario, in a high-fidelity flight simulator. Reactions to stress were indexed via self-report; performance was assessed subjectively (flight instructor assessment) and objectively (simulator metrics); gaze behavior data were captured using a mobile eye tracker, and measures of attentional control were subsequently calculated (search rate, stimulus driven attention, and entropy). Results: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that a threat response was associated with poorer performance and disrupted attentional control. Conclusion: The findings add to previous research showing that individual reactions to stress influence performance and shed light on the processes through which stress influences performance. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis."
"Individual differences in the calibration of trust in automation","2015","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930442341&partnerID=40&md5=af4564077cb066eeb1c2203d3ddda2cd","Objective: The objective was to determine whether operators with an expectancy that automation is trustworthy are better at calibrating their trust to changes in the capabilities of automation, and if so, why. Background: Studies suggest that individual differences in automation expectancy may be able to account for why changes in the capabilities of automation lead to a substantial change in trust for some, yet only a small change for others. Method: In a baggage screening task, 225 participants searched for weapons in 200 X-ray images of luggage. Participants were assisted by an automated decision aid exhibiting different levels of reliability. Measures of expectancy that automation is trustworthy were used in conjunction with subjective measures of trust and perceived reliability to identify individual differences in trust calibration. Results: Operators with high expectancy that automation is trustworthy were more sensitive to changes (both increases and decreases) in automation reliability. This difference was eliminated by manipulating the causal attribution of automation errors. Conclusion: Attributing the cause of automation errors to factors external to the automation fosters an understanding of tasks and situations in which automation differs in reliability and may lead to more appropriate trust. Application: The development of interventions can lead to calibrated trust in automation. © 2014, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

In a randomized crossover design, 10 physically active males completed a simulated 5-h domestic flight (DOM), 24-h simulated international travel (INT), and a control trial (CON). The mild hypoxia, seating arrangements, and activity levels typically encountered during air travel were simulated in a normobaric, hypoxic altitude room. Physical performance was assessed in the afternoon of the day before (D-1 PM) and in the morning (D+1 AM) and afternoon (D+1 PM) of the day following each trial. Mood states and physiological and perceptual responses to exercise were also examined at these time points, while sleep quantity and quality were monitored throughout each condition. Sleep quantity and quality were significantly reduced during INT compared with CON and DOM (P<0.01). Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 1 test performance was significantly reduced at D+1 PM following INT compared with CON and DOM (P<0.01), where performance remained unchanged (P>0.05). Compared with baseline, physiological and perceptual responses to exercise, and mood states were exacerbated following the INT trial (P<0.05). Attenuated intermittent-sprint performance following simulated international air travel may be due to sleep disruption during travel and the subsequent exacerbated physiological and perceptual markers of fatigue. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Background: HAI is an important characteristic of many modern work situations. Of course, the cognitive subsystems are not immediately apparent by observing a functioning system, but correlations between variables may reveal important relations. Method: The current report examined pilot judgments of 11 HAI dimensions (e.g., Workload, Task Management, Stress/Nervousness, Monitoring Automation, and Cross-Checking Automation) across 48 scenarios that required airline pilots to interact with automation on the flight deck. Results: We found three major clusters of the dimensions identifying subsystems on the flight deck: a workload subsystem, a management subsystem, and an awareness subsystem. Discussion: Relationships characterized by simple correlations cohered in ways that suggested underlying subsystems consistent with those that had previously been theorized. Application: Understanding the relationship among dimensions affecting HAI is an important aspect in determining how a new piece of automation designed to affect one dimension will affect other dimensions as well."

"Surgeons’ Attitudes Are Associated With Reoperation and Readmission Rates","2015","Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939891246&partnerID=40&md5=ccee3ab321ffb9b7cf1903f3559adc19","Background: Attitudes influence how people make decisions. In an effort to decrease pilot judgment-related accidents, the Federal Aviation Administration teaches new pilots about hazardous attitudes that are believed to be incompatible with safe flight: macho, impulsive, worry, resignation, self-confidence, and antiauthority. If these attitudes are hazardous for pilots and their passengers, they may also be incompatible with the reliable and safe delivery of surgical care. Questions/purposes: The purposes of this study were (1) to ascertain to what extent surgeons harbor hazardous attitudes; and (2) to determine their relationship, if any, to reoperation and readmission rates. Methods: We selected validated aviation psychology tools that are used to measure these attitudes in pilots. We converted the aviation scenarios to analogous situations for surgeons and invited all surgeons from one academic program to participate in this study. A total of 41 surgeons were eligible to participate; 37 (90%) completed the attitude prevalence protocol and 31 (76%) had complete reoperation and readmission data for the correlation and regression analysis. Attending orthopaedic surgeons completed the Modified Surgeon Hazardous Attitude Scale as well as a series of additional instruments. Results: Levels of macho thought to be hazardous in pilots were present in nine (24%) surgeons. Similar, elevated levels of self-confidence were found in three (8%) surgeons. High levels of impulsivity were found in 5% (two surgeons) and high levels of antiauthority were found in 3% (one surgeon). Only one (3%) surgeon reported elevated levels of worry and no surgeon reported hazardous levels of resignation. Thirty percent (11 surgeons) of surgeons harbored at least one elevated attitude level. In a regression model, macho attitude levels predicted 19% of the variation in surgeons’ rate of readmissions and reoperations. Conclusions: High levels of hazardous attitudes may not be consistent with the routine delivery of safe surgical care in a teamwork setting where human factors and safe systems are the key to success. Further research is needed to determine if abnormally high levels of these hazardous attitudes impact patient care. Level of Evidence: Level II, prognostic study.

"How Prevalent Are Hazardous Attitudes Among Orthopaedic Surgeons?","2015","Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939887501&partnerID=40&md5=d234d5fe76ffff4c70d7fa4581b18b7c","Background: So-called “hazardous attitudes” (macho, impulsive, antiauthority, resignation, invulnerable, and confident) were identified by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Canadian Air Transport Administration as contributing to road traffic incidents among college-aged drivers and felt to be useful for the prevention of aviation accidents. The concept of hazardous attitudes may also be useful in understanding adverse events in surgery, but it has not been widely studied. Questions/purposes: We surveyed a cohort of orthopaedic surgeons to determine the following: (1) What is the prevalence of hazardous attitudes in a large cohort of orthopaedic surgeons? (2) Do practice setting and/or demographics influence variation in hazardous attitudes in our cohort of surgeons? (3) Do surgeons feel they work in a climate that promotes patient safety? Methods: We asked the members of the Science of Variation Group—fully trained, practicing orthopaedic and trauma surgeons from around the world—to complete a questionnaire validated in college-aged drivers measuring six attitudes associated with a greater likelihood of collision and used by pilots to assess and teach aviation safety. We accepted this validation as applicable to surgeons and modified the questionnaire accordingly. We also asked them to complete the Modified Safety Climate Questionnaire, a questionnaire assessing the absence of a safety climate that is based on the patient safety cultures in healthcare organizations instrument. Three hundred sixty-four orthopaedic surgeons participated, representing a 47% response rate of those with correct email addresses who were invited. Results: Thirty-eight percent (137 of 364 surgeons) had at least one score that would have been considered dangerously high in pilots (> 20), including 102 with dangerous levels of macho (28%) and 41 with dangerous levels of self-confidence (11%). After accounting for possible confounding variables, the variables most closely associated with a macho attitude deemed hazardous in pilots were supervision of surgical trainees in the operating room (p = 0.003); location of practice in Canada (p = 0.059), Europe (p = 0.021), and the United States (p = 0.005); and being an orthopaedic trauma surgeon (p = 0.046) (when compared with general orthopaedic surgeons), but accounted for only 5.3% of the variance (p < 0.001). On average, 19% of surgeon responses to the Modified Safety Climate Questionnaire implied absence of a safety climate. Conclusions: Hazardous attitudes are common among orthopaedic surgeons and relate in small part to demographics and practice setting. Future studies should further validate the measure of hazardous attitudes among surgeons and determine if they are associated with preventable adverse events. We agree with aviation safety experts that awareness of amelioration of such attitudes might improve safety in all complex, high-risk endeavors, including surgery—a line of thinking that merits additional research. © 2014, The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®."

This function is particularly critical when pilots have to recall series of air traffic control instructions. However, working memory limitations may jeopardize flight safety. Since the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) method seems promising for assessing working memory load, our objective is to implement an on-line fNIRS-based inference system that integrates two complementary estimators. The first estimator is a real-time state estimation MACD-based algorithm dedicated to identifying the pilot's instantaneous mental state (not-on-task vs. on-task). It does not require a calibration process to perform its estimation. The second estimator is an online SVM-based classifier that is able to discriminate task difficulty (low working memory load vs. high working memory load). These two estimators were tested with 19 pilots who were placed in a realistic flight simulator and were asked to recall air traffic control instructions. We found that the estimated pilot's mental state matched significantly better than chance with the pilot' s real state (62% global accuracy, 58% specificity, and 72% sensitivity). The second estimator, dedicated to assessing single trial working memory loads, led to 80% classification accuracy, 72% specificity, and 89% sensitivity. These two estimators establish reusable blocks for further fNIRS-based passive brain computer interface development. © 2015 Gateau et al."

Little is known, however, about the course of PTS after life threat in the absence of collateral stressors (e.g., bereavement, social stigma, property loss) and there is a scarcity of studies about PTS in the long term. This study assessed the short- and long-term course of PTS, and the influence of gender, education and age on the level and course of PTS, in survivors from a non-fatal airliner emergency landing caused by engine failure at an altitude of 1 km. There were 129 persons on board. A survey including the Impact of Event Scale was distributed to 106 subjects after 1 month, 4 months, 14 months, and 25 months, and to 95 subjects after 19 years (response rates 64-83%). There were initially high levels of PTS. The majority of changes in PTS occurred from 1 to 4 months after the event. There were small changes from 4 to 25 months but further decrease in PTS thereafter. Female gender was associated with higher levels of PTS whereas gender was unrelated to the slope of the short- and longterm trajectories. Higher education was related to a quicker recovery although not to initial or long-term PTS. Age was not associated with PTS. The present findings suggest that a life-threatening experience without collateral stressors may produce high levels of acute posttraumatic stress, yet with a benign prognosis. The findings further implicate that gender is unrelated to trajectories of recovery in the context of highly similar exposure and few collateral stressors. © 2015 Arnberg et al."

In laboratory studies, they are sensitive to sleep/wake history and circadian phase. The present analyses examined whether they reliably reflect sleep/wake history and circadian phase during transmeridian flight operations. Data were combined from four studies (237 pilots, 730 out-and-back flights between 13 city pairs, 1-3-day layovers). Sleep was monitored (wrist actigraphy, logbooks) before, during and after trips. On duty days, sleepiness, fatigue and mean response speed were measured pre-flight and at the top of the descent. Mixed-model analysis of variance examined associations between these measures and sleep/wake history, after controlling for operational factors. Circadian phase was approximated by local (domicile) time in the city where each trip began and ended. More sleep in the 24 h prior to duty was associated with lower pre-flight sleepiness and fatigue and faster response speed. Sleepiness and fatigue were greater before flights departing during the domicile night and early morning. At the top of the descent, pilots felt less sleepy and fatigued after more in-flight sleep and less time awake. Flights arriving in the early-mid-morning (domicile time) had greater sleepiness and fatigue and slower response speeds than flights arriving later. Subjective ratings showed expected associations with sleep/wake history and circadian phase. The response speed showed expected circadian variation but was not associated with sleep/wake history at the top of the descent. This may reflect moderate levels of fatigue at this time and/or atypically fast responses among pilots. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society."

This chapter discusses processes involved in achieving this balance by reviewing a range of literatures including organizational theory, organizational behavior, work psychology, social psychology, and human factors. After a short introduction into general literature on the management of uncertainty in organizations, the chapter turns to research concerned with high-risk environments and is organized by level of analysis, starting at the individual level and continuing on to the team and organizational levels.

The principal theories examined are deterrence, economic rational acting, responsive regulation, and the findings of behavioural psychology. Leading examples of the various approaches are given in order to illustrate the models: private enforcement of law through litigation in the USA, public enforcement of competition law by the European Commission, and the recent reform of policies on public enforcement of regulatory law in the United Kingdom. Noting that behavioural psychology has as yet had only limited application in legal and regulatory theory, the book then analyses various European regulatory structures where behavioural techniques can be seen or could be applied. Sectors examined include financial services, civil aviation, pharmaceuticals, and workplace health & safety. Key findings are that 'enforcement' has to focus on identifying the causes of non-compliance, so as to be able to support improved performance, rather than be based on fear motivating complete compliance. Systems in which reporting is essential for safety only function with a no-blame culture. The book concludes by proposing an holistic model for maximising compliance within large organisations, combining public regulatory and criminal controls with internal corporate systems and external influences by stakeholders, held together by a unified core of ethical principles. Hence, the book proposes a new theory of ethical regulation. © Christopher Hodges 2015. All rights reserved."

Eventually, specific events have been designed to trigger S, R and K like behaviours and then integrated into realistic Air Traffic Management (ATM) simulations. A machine-learning algorithm has been used to differentiate the three different levels of cognitive control by using brain features extracted from the EEG rhythms of different brain areas, that is, the frontal theta and the parietal alpha activities. Twelve professional Air-Traffic-Controllers (ATCOs) from the École Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC) of Toulouse (France) have been involved in the study. The results showed that the algorithm was able to differentiate with high discrimination accuracy (AUC > 0.7) the three S-R-K cognitive behaviours during simulated air-Traffic scenarios in an ecological ATM environment."
"Using a human-centric design process for the implementation of advanced computer-based tools in space programs","2015","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991666673&partnerID=40&md5=8e022c789cb247383fe8ffd7e514957a","One of the challenges for long-duration crewed missions to deep space is the use of advanced computer tools. We first need a thorough understanding of how to successfully incorporate these in current processes that support the design and actual built of projects here on Earth that will be sent to space. This study will use as an example the implementation of advanced computer-based tools to the traditional pen and paper redlined process. A redline process is used in aerospace companies to reflect any changes made to a document. The effectiveness of proposed computer-based tools and their interaction with the user will be explored. It is necessary to understand the challenges and scientific processes that come with the integration of both the user and complex systems such as computer-based tools as new release methods for redlined procedures. Typically these types of tools use a universal design that allows accessibility by everyone, but making these tools too general may lose the user-oriented idea. A major challenge is to create safe systems that are easy for the user to understand and operate; this means a system that incorporates a human-centric design process. Methods that can quickly be processed through human's perceptual system and expand our working memory and information storage will be explored, such as the influence of different organizational factors in employees' behavior, actions, and job performance. Personnel and products safety as well as the effectiveness of our performance may depend on several of those organizational factors, yet many times they are not taken into account. For example, when organizational changes are made to departments or procedures without clearly having communicated to the teams can result in significant mishaps. We will see how the cognitive processing of decision making for human-machine interaction through the practices used in aviation psychology and crew resource management can help minimize human errors in the aerospace realm. The correct integration of advanced computer-based tools with the abilities and limitations of humans will be helpful for earlier detection and better management of errors during the design and built of space programs here on Earth. Once that process is well understood and established we will be able to apply it in future human missions into deep space. © © 2015 by the International Astronautical Federation."

When the STAMP is applied as management tool, controls may be introduced too soon in the analysis since it is necessary to understand emergent behaviour first. Emergent behaviour can be studied through organizational ethnography in parallel development with an agent-based model, as illustrated in a case study of airport ground handling services. Based on ethnographic research and theories from psychology and social sciences, we developed an agent model that showed why repeated attempts at managerial control to improve employees' safety compliance were not durable. The insights obtained through the case study attained to move management ideas about what control means towards creating smarter design and communication processes that involve the work force. © 2015 The Authors."
"Modelling of situation awareness with perception, attention, and prior and retrospective awareness","2015","Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960798080&partnerID=40&md5=03170e2b61876876ec7780feadf8fab1","Human awareness under different circumstances is complex and non-trivial to understand. Nevertheless, due to the importance of awareness for safety and efficiency in many domains (e.g.; the aviation domain), it is necessary to study the processes behind situation awareness, to eliminate possible errors in action selection that may lead to disasters. Interesting models for situation awareness have been presented, mainly from an ecological psychology perspective, but they are debatable with respect to the latest neurocognitive evidences. With the developments in brain imaging and recording techniques, more and more detailed information on complex cognitive processes becomes available. This provides room to further investigate the mechanisms behind many cognitive phenomena, including situation awareness. This paper presents a computational cognitive agent model for situation awareness from the perspective of action selection, which is inspired by neurocognitive evidences. The model integrates bottom-up and top-down cognitive processes, related to various cognitive states: perception, desires, attention, intention, (prior and retrospective) awareness, ownership, feeling, and communication. Based on the model, various cognitive effects can be explained, such as perceptual load, predictive processes, inferential processes, cognitive controlling, unconscious bias, and conscious bias. A model like this will be useful in domains that benefit from complex simulations of socio-technical systems (e.g. the aviation domain) based on computational models of human behaviour. In such domains, existing agent-based simulations are limited, since most of the agent models do not include realistic nature-inspired processes. The validity of the model is illustrated based on simulations for the aviation domain, focusing on a particular situation where an agent has biased perception, poor comprehension, habitual driven projection, and conflict between prior and retrospective effects on action execution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the strategies these individuals use to cope with the onset of fatigue are also unknown. The current study explored the symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies experienced by maritime pilots when on-shift.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty maritime pilots were recruited via an advertisement in the national association's quarterly newsletter (Mage = 51.42; SD = 9.81). Participants responded to a modified version of the questionnaire used with aviation pilots that assessed overall fatigue, and the symptoms pilots associated with fatigue on duty. Methods pilots used to cope with fatigue before shift and when on the bridge were also assessed.RESULTS: There were significant effects for pilot vitality on 4 categories of fatigue: cognitive dysfunction; emotional disturbance; mean physical effects; and sleepiness. There were no significant effects for vitality on any of the self-reported coping strategy factors.CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that maritime pilots experience a variety of physical, behavioural, and cognitive fatigue symptoms when on shift. Some of these symptoms are similar to those reported by aviation pilots. However, unlike aviation pilots, maritime pilots reported utilising self-sufficient coping strategies to deal with the experience of fatigue."

Skilled diagnosis is essential for accurate and efficient performance across a range of organizational contexts, including aviation, finance, rail, forensic investigation, firefighting, and medicine. However, it is also a complex process, subject to the abilities and experience of individual operators, the culture and practices of organizations, the relationships between operators, and the availability and usefulness of technology. As a consequence, diagnostic skills can be difficult to learn, maintain, and evaluate. This volume is a comprehensive approach that examines diagnostic expertise at the level of the individual practitioner, in the social context, and at the organizational level. The chapter authors comprise both academics and highly skilled practitioners so that there is a clear transition from understanding the problem of diagnostic skills to the implementation of solutions, either through redesign, training, and/or selection. It will appeal to those academics and practitioners interested and involved in this field and also prove useful to students of psychology, cognitive science education and/or computer interaction. © Mark W.

Exposure to environmental noise may affect sleep duration and quality. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between airport noise exposure and insufficient sleep in the United States by using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Methods: Data on the number of days without enough rest or sleep for approximately 750,000 respondents to the 2008 and 2009 BRFSS were linked with data on noise exposure modeled using the US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Integrated Noise Model for 95 major US airports for corresponding years. Noise exposure data were stratified into 3 groups depending on noise levels. People living outside airport noise exposure zones were included as a reference category. Results: We found 8.6 mean days of insufficient sleep in the previous 30 days among 745,868 adults; 10.8% reported insufficient sleep for all 30 days; and 30.1% reported no days of insufficient sleep. After controlling for individual sociodemographics and ZIP Codelevel socioeconomic status, we found no significant differences in sleep insufficiency between the 3 noise exposure zones and the zone outside. Conclusion: This research demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a national study of airport noise and sleep using an existing public health surveillance dataset and recommends methods for improving the accuracy of such studies; some of these recommendations were implemented in recent FAA-sponsored studies. Validation of BRFSS sleep measures and refined ways of collecting data are needed to determine the optimal measures of sleep for such a large-scale survey and to establish the relationship between airport noise and sleep."
"Trigeminal neuralgia induced by cobra venom in the rat leads to deficits in abilities of spatial learning and memory","2015","Pain Physician","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925299306&partnerID=40&md5=a5c57abe2a2bb26e131394218abf558f","Background: Patients with chronic pain usually suffer from cognitive impairment, with memory deterioration being the most common deficit that affects daily functioning and quality of life. The causes for this impairment are not clear despite intensive clinical studies. Few studies have evaluated impaired learning using animal models of persistent pain. Objective: In this study, a new trigeminal neuralgia model induced by cobra venom was adopted to explore effects of chronic pain on spatial learning and memory in rats. Study Design: Controlled animal study. Setting: Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine & Critical Care Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University. Methods: Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 15): NS control group and cobra venom group, 0.9% sterile saline or cobra venom solution was injected into the sheath of the infraorbital nerve (ION), respectively. The development of trigeminal neuralgia was accessed by changes in free behavioral activity 3 days before the surgery and 3, 7, 12, 20, and 30 days after the surgery to identify whether the model was successful or not. Morris water maze test determined the abilities of spatial learning and memory at the time points before the surgery, and 2 weeks and 5 weeks after the surgery. We also observed the ultrastructure of the ION and medulla oblongata of rats following 8 weeks of chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain. Results: Rats with the cobra venom injection displayed significantly more face grooming and fewer exploratory activities compared to the NS control group or baseline (P < 0.01). Both groups improved their latency to reach the platform with the largest difference on the first day (P < 0.01), but without memory deficits in a probe trial for the second water maze protocol. For the third water maze testing, the rats in the cobra venom group experienced decreased abilities of spatial learning and memory, a longer latency with spatial memory deficits during the probe trial (P < 0.05). At the ultrastructural level, we found changes in the medulla oblongata after cobra venom injection resulting in severe demyelination and loss of axons that might be implicated in the causes of cognitive deficits. Limitations: Limitations include partial vision loss in the eye on the lesion side of the rats that might be missed and the absence of evaluating the ultrastructural changes in other parts of the brain. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that trigeminal neuralgia induced by cobra venom in adult rats can impair spatial learning and memory function over time and results in demonstrable changes in the ultrastructure of the medulla oblongata. This new animal model may be useful for future studies on the effect of chronic pain on learning and cognition. © 2015, Association of Pain Management Anesthesiologists. All rights reserved."

Asians are known to have higher risks because they are less careful in pretravel health preparations. This study reports on a cohort of travellers to malaria-prone regions examined in a previous study, which explored general levels of pretravel health preparation. Objectives To describe the preparations taken by travellers at Hong Kong International Airport going to destinations with significant malaria risks according to the WHO. Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted by personal interviews at the boarding gates of flights in April 2013. The flights were chosen from those to malaria-prone regions (type I or above) from the 2012 WHO International Travel and Health Country List. Results 403 respondents (75.6% Chinese ethnicity) were travelling to malaria-prone regions. 95.3% were travelling to developing countries including China, Thailand, Malaysia and India. 55.1% of respondents had taken at least one mosquito prevention measure and 8.9% of respondents had malaria chemoprophylaxis. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender (OR=2.21, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.97), residence outside Hong Kong (OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.46 to 5.04) and travel including rural areas (OR=5.67, 95% CI 3.11 to 10.34) were predictors of optimum pre-travel health preparations. Conclusions Underestimation of malaria risks was a major barrier to adequate pre-travel health preparations.

A best practice for researchers using statistics would therefore be to share data among co-authors, allowing double-checking of executed tasks just as co-pilots do in aviation. To document the extent to which this 'co-piloting' currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance. Overall, the probability that a given p-value was inconsistent was over 10%. Co-piloting was not found to be associated with reporting errors."

Little is known about the determinants of injury among these workers. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services (AFFES) records detailed information on two mutually exclusive types of workplace injury: First aid (self-reported) and Workplace Safety Insurance Board (WSIB, i.e. received medical attention).AIMS: To identify the contributions of physical and psychological factors on the likelihood of injury among forest firefighters.METHODS: Participants were male and female forest firefighters aged between 18 and 65. Data were collected using two self-administered instruments: The NEO Personality Inventory and the Job Stress Survey. Secondary data were collected from the OMNR AFFES and data were analysed by way of multivariate statistical procedures.RESULTS: There were 252 participants. Those who were older, had a history of injury, had high scores for the personality construct of Neuroticism or low scores for the Openness construct were significantly more likely to incur a first aid injury, while those with high experience levels were significantly less likely to incur injury (P < 0.05). High job stress was the only significant predictor of WSIB injury (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: First aid and WSIB injuries in the OMNR AFFES were quite distinct phenomena and different factors need consideration in their prediction. It is recommended that managers and decision-makers in this field consider factors such as job stress, personality and the prior occurrence of injuries in their assessment of risk. © The Author 2014.

Experience from recent incidents suggests that these qualities may generally be lacking in organizations that manage drilling operations today. Research sponsored by oil-and-gas producers and others has suggested that creating a sense of ""chronic unease"" in relation to barrier integrity and operation of safety-critical systems, combined with understanding of the psychological issues that create error-producing conditions, will strengthen defenses against major accidents occurring. The question remains as to the best way to embed the necessary skills through teaching, coaching, and assessment and their integration into routine working practices. Experience from aviation suggests that successful implementation of nontechnical skills needs to be combined with a clearly defined operational framework. Such an operational framework, however, is not widely observed in the drilling community at present. A standardized approach that defines how drilling operations are to be executed, activities monitored, decisions made, or changes managed in a time-constrained environment provides the context in which the necessary individual and organizational skills can be taught. Training needs to address the underlying psychological theory-in particular, cognitive biases-of nontechnical skills to counter threats and errors in the workplace. The paper summarizes the principles of high-reliability organizations and their contribution to process safety in the context of drilling operations. Then, we describe Threat-and-Error Management, which evolved from aviation-based Crew-Resource Management to produce the levels of safety that today we accept as normal. We introduce operational risk management in drilling as the analogous link with aviation. The paper concludes by illustrating how one can use these concepts in drilling operations to enhance routine risk-management activities, and presents a description of the tools and techniques involved. The advantage of this approach is that effective nontechnical skills can be observed, coached, and assessed on a routine basis in the workplace. Active use of these methods in everyday drilling operations promotes the essential characteristics of a high-reliability organization by instilling the sense of chronic unease and concern for barrier integrity, thereby reducing the chance of minor anomalies cascading into major accidental events. © © 2014 Society of Petroleum Engineers"

Evidence-based approaches to injury prevention could be strengthened by adding person-level characteristics (e.g., demographics) to risk models tested on diverse soldier samples studied over time.Purpose To identify person-level risk indicators of accident deaths in Regular Army soldiers during a time frame of intense military operations, and to discriminate risk of not-line-of-duty from line-of-duty accident deaths.Methods Administrative data acquired from multiple Army/Department of Defense sources for active duty Army soldiers during 2004-2009 were analyzed in 2013. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify person-level sociodemographic, service-related, occupational, and mental health predictors of accident deaths.Results Delayed rank progression or demotion and being male, unmarried, in a combat arms specialty, and of low rank/service length increased odds of accident death for enlisted soldiers. Unique to officers was high risk associated with aviation specialties. Accident death risk decreased over time for currently deployed, enlisted soldiers and increased for those never deployed. Mental health diagnosis was associated with risk only for previous and never-deployed, enlisted soldiers. Models did not discriminate not-line-of-duty from line-of-duty accident deaths.Conclusions Adding more refined person-level and situational risk indicators to current models could enhance understanding of accident death risk specific to soldier rank and deployment status.

Fifty-one undergraduate students from the general psychology department subject pool at a major university in the southeastern United States received instruction on the basic principles of flight via one of three versions of a computer-based tutorial (no query, low-level elaboration query, or high-level elaboration query). Participants had no prior knowledge or previous experience with the aviation domain. A one-way between-groups design was employed, with the query method serving as the independent variable and a sample size of 17 per condition. Dependent variables included knowledge organization, knowledge acquisition, and instructional efficiency. Overall, results showed that incorporating low-level elaboration queries into the training resulted in improved organization, integration, and application of task-relevant knowledge and higher instructional efficiency. High-level elaboration queries consistently failed to produce significantly better post-training outcomes, possibly due to the increased cognitive load imposed on learners during training. The discussion centers on theoretical and practical implications for promoting and assessing learning outcomes in computer-based training. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

"Significance of time awake for predicting pilots' fatigue on short-haul flights: Implications for flight duty time regulations","2014","Journal of Sleep Research","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908893349&partnerID=40&md5=aaa906770fcba5e42c3c25ccba758d20","European regulations restrict the duration of the maximum daily flight duty period for pilots as a function of the duty start time and the number of scheduled flights. However, late duty end times that may include long times awake are not specifically regulated. In this study, fatigue levels in pilots finishing their duty late at night (00:00-01:59 hour) were analysed and compared with pilots starting their duty early (05:00-06:59 hour). Fatigue levels of 40 commercial short-haul pilots were studied during a total of 188 flight duty periods, of which 87 started early and 22 finished late. Pilots used a small handheld computer to maintain a duty and sleep log, and to indicate fatigue levels immediately after each flight. Sleep logs were checked with actigraphy. Pilots on late-finishing flight duty periods were more fatigued at the end of their duty than pilots on early-starting flight duty periods, despite the fact that preceding sleep duration was longer by 1.1 h. Linear mixed-model regression identified time awake as a preeminent factor predicting fatigue. Workload had a minor effect. Pilots on late-finishing flight duty periods were awake longer by an average of 5.5 h (6.6 versus 1.1 h) before commencing their duty than pilots who started early in the morning. Late-finishing flights were associated with long times awake at a time when the circadian system stops promoting alertness, and an increased, previously underestimated fatigue risk. Based on these findings, flight duty limitations should consider not only duty start time, but also the time of the final landing. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society."

It was hypothesized that intentional response distortion would either increase towards the end of a long questionnaire, as learning effects might make it easier to adjust responses to a faking good schema, or decrease because applicants' will to distort responses is reduced if the questionnaire lasts long enough. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that certain types of questionnaire content are especially vulnerable to response distortion. Eighty-four pre-selected pilot applicants filled out a questionnaire consisting of 516 items including items from the NEO five factor inventory (NEO FFI), NEO personality inventory revised (NEO PI-R) and business-focused inventory of personality (BIP). The positions of the items were varied within the applicant sample to test if responses are affected by item order, and applicants' response behaviour was additionally compared to that of volunteers. Applicants reported significantly higher mean scores than volunteers, and results provide some evidence of decreased faking tendencies towards the end of the questionnaire. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that lower variances or standard deviations in combination with appropriate (often higher) mean scores can serve as an indicator for faking tendencies in group comparisons, even if effects are not significant. © 2014 International Union of Psychological Science."

The trouble lay not in their choice of tests but in their performance measures for bombardiering, a difficulty that came to be known as 'the problem of the criterion.'

Commonality between failures will assist in understanding reliability in maintenance processes, thereby preventing accidents in high-hazard domains. Background: Methods exist for understanding the human factors contributing to accidents. Their application in a maintenance context mainly has been advanced in aviation and nuclear power. Maintenance in the petroleum industry provides a different context for investigating the role that human factors play in influencing outcomes. It is therefore worth investigating the contributing human factors to improve our understanding of both human factors in reliability and the factors specific to this domain. Method: Detailed analyses were conducted of maintenance-related failures (N = 38) in a petroleum company using structured interviews with maintenance technicians. The interview structure was based on the Human Factor Investigation Tool (HFIT), which in turn was based on Rasmussen's model of human malfunction. Results: A mean of 9.5 factors per incident was identified across the cases investigated. The three most frequent human factors contributing to the maintenance failures were found to be assumption (79% of cases), design and maintenance (71%), and communication (66%). Conclusion: HFIT proved to be a useful instrument for identifying the pattern of human factors that recurred most frequently in maintenance-related failures. Application: The high frequency of failures attributed to assumptions and communication demonstrated the importance of problem-solving abilities and organizational communication in a domain where maintenance personnel have a high degree of autonomy and a wide geographical distribution.

The influences on SA in inpatient medicine are unknown. Methods We conducted seven focus groups with nurses, respiratory therapists and resident physicians using a standardised semistructured focus group guide to promote discussion. Recordings of the focus groups were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were qualitatively analysed by two independent reviewers to identify convergent and divergent themes. Results Three themes emerged: (1) team-based care, (2) availability of standardised data and (3) standardised processes and procedures. We categorised these into social, technological and organisational influences on SA. Subthemes that emerged from each focus group were shared language to describe at-risk patients, provider experience in critical care/deterioration and interdisciplinary huddles to identify and plan for at-risk patients. An objective early warning score, proactive assessment and planning, adequate clinician staffing and tools for entering, displaying and monitoring data trends were identified by six of seven groups. Our data better reflected the concepts of team SA and shared SA than individual SA. Conclusions Team-based care and standardisation support SA and the identification and treatment of patient risk in the complex environment of inpatient care. These findings can be used to guide the development and implementation of targeted interventions such as huddles to proactively scan for risk and electronic health record displays of data trends."

"ZMET: A psychological approach to understanding unsustainable tourism mobility","2014","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086983518&partnerID=40&md5=027b75f6433c5a03f10d85fc4d0511cd","As the scale of global tourism flows continues to grow and the impacts of climate change become more apparent, issues related to tourism mobilities and the ability of destinations to sustain long-haul markets will become increasingly important. Distance is a particularly important factor because, as the average distance of individual trips grows, there is an increase in the collective environmental impact of annual emissions. The magnitude of anticipated increases in global air travel is demonstrated by a recent report from Boeing that forecasts that the total demand for passenger jet aircraft is likely to grow from 20,000 aircraft in 2010 to 40,000 in 2030 (Boeing, 2013). One issue that is likely to affect the ability of destinations to maintain long-haul tourism flows in the future is the impact of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emission. Actions of this nature are already occurring with carbon pricing schemes implemented in Australia and the EU (World Bank, 2013). Despite many protests, the UK government has imposed the Air Passenger Duty as a climate change mitigation strategy by increasing the price of air travel and in the process making the UK’s air travel tax one of the highest in the world. The issue of sustainable mobilities will grow in importance as concerns over climate change begin to determine international policy agendas. The implications for tourism are obvious, particularly the longhaul aviation sector that is currently the tourism industry’s major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (UNWTO-UNEP-WMO, 2008). Any change in demand for long-haul travel due to climate change mitigation policies will have a knock-on effect on short-haul travel and in so doing change the demand patterns for domestic road, rail, air and sea transport. Changing patterns of demand of this nature will create new opportunities for destinations as well as close off existing opportunities. A number of studies have noted the gap between awareness of climate change and personal actions undertaken to alter personal travel behaviours (Becken, 2004; Huebner, 2012; McKercher et al., 2010). Several researchers have noted that engaging in air travel to distant destinations is seen as a right by many consumers (Becken, 2007). In some cases, lack of action stems from the belief that it is the role of other agencies, not the individual, to make changes that can reduce the impact of climate change (McKercher et al., 2013). Changing attitudes is a complex task and as Pidgeon (2011) acknowledges, even in circumstances where accepting personal responsibility might save one’s life, wearing seat belts for example, long-term communication strategies, backed by punitive action, were required to achieve the desired effects. Understanding and then changing consumer attitudes is, therefore, a pressing issue. Achieving tourists’ social and behavioural change could be a key to achieving responsible tourism, particularly where climate change is concerned. Research has demonstrated that tourists do not choose environmentally friendly transportation despite their declared positive attitudes towards sustainable tourism (Beudeanu, 2007). As Gössling et al. (2010) observed, technology and management alone cannot reduce emissions. To overcome the apparent reluctance to cut back on personal air travel (Higham et al., 2013), there is a need to address existing discrepancies between tourist intention (what they say they would like to do) and behaviour (what they actually do). A recent paper by McNamara and Prideaux (2010) illustrates this gap, in that case between tourists’ self-reported use of interpretation provided in a natural area and actual observed use. Although a large majority of respondents reported that the availability of environmental information at a forest site was important, only 24 per cent of visitors actually stopped to read interpretative signs, with the average time spent reading being 2.1 minutes. Recent evidence (Kollmuss and Agyeman, 2002; Sheeran, 2002) suggests that attitude-behaviour gaps present themselves as substantial psychological barriers to positive change. For an approach based on reducing these barriers to be effective, new psychological and behavioural approaches are required. There is, therefore, an urgent need to understand responses at the individual level using techniques that reflect the complexities of a tourist’s thoughts and behaviour. This chapter outlines a relatively new method to identify and evaluate varied deep-seated motivations in individual travel practices and those choices that may constitute barriers to increased sustainability. It outlines how the Zaltman metaphor elicitation method (ZMET) technique may be used to identify barriers to individuals adopting sustainable mobility practices. It draws on the psychology of travel and tourism, and on the growing use of photographs and photography as a tool for understanding travel psychology. © 2014 Editorial matter and selection: Scott A.

"Sociological barriers to developing sustainable discretionary air travel behaviour","2014","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086957682&partnerID=40&md5=0cb05a273fb4f0466ed3c0800bad36c6","Mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions from air travel is one of the most challenging aspects of society’s response to climate change (Monbiot, 2007). Whereas research from the transport and tourism sectors agrees that air travel emissions are a key environmental challenge (Barr et al., 2010; Becken, 2007; Scott, 2011; Scott et al., 2012), how to best address the climate impacts of discretionary air travel remains an elusive problem (Cohen et al., 2011). Scope for further efficiency gains in aircraft emissions is declining (Scott et al., 2010), and there is not yet a global climate policy for international commercial aviation (Duval, 2013). Signatories of airlines in the United Kingdom, for instance, instead of choosing to transform supply or raise consumer awareness of air travel’s climate impacts, presently pin their hopes for a sustainable aviation future on technology, alternative fuels and operational innovations (Sustainable Aviation, 2011). In the context of industry resistance to wholesale supply changes and in the absence to date of a global market-based mechanism for aviation, such as carbon trading, the concept of encouraging voluntary public behaviour change has been presented as a mechanism for moving discretionary air travel consumption towards a more sustainable pathway (Barr et al., 2011a; Miller et al., 2010). Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour change has been discussed in environmental psychology more generally (e.g. Steg and Vlek, 2009) and with regards to climate impacts specifically (e.g. Barr et al., 2011a; Semenza et al., 2008). The prospects for positive behaviour change in the context of the public’s air travel behaviour have been the focus of recent empirical attention, with studies finding gaps between awareness and attitudes (Hares et al., 2010) and attitudes and behaviour (Kroesen, 2013; Miller et al., 2010). These works point to a breakdown in consumer decision-making processes in the context of discretionary air travel behaviour, in which environmental awareness and proenvironmental attitudes are not in practice translating to voluntary sustained behavioural changes (McKercher et al., 2010). Barr et al. (2010), who sought to understand tourists’ environmental concern in relation to a wider scope of everyday lives and their processes of decision-making, found that participants who were committed to environmental practices at home were unwilling to reduce holiday air travel. This suggests that there are fundamental barriers to changing discretionary air travel behaviour, even amongst pro-environmental consumers. This chapter takes Barr et al.‘s (2010) finding that environmental concern may not transcend “home” to the context of “away” as its departure point. Based on 50 in-depth semi-structured interviews carried out in Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom, we illustrate behavioural consistencies and inconsistencies with respect to climate change amongst consumers in both everyday domestic (home) and tourism (away) practices. In contrast to Barr et al. (2010), however, we use both modern and postmodern sociological theory to explain why these seemingly contradictory consumption decisions occur. Specifically, we engage modern theory on tourism as liminoid space (Turner, 1982) and postmodern theory that suggests that personal identity (and consequently behaviour) is inconsistent and performed differently across varying contexts (Bell, 2008; Edensor, 2001). The findings of our research, framed within these theoretical perspectives, hold important implications for the viability of climate change mitigation strategies that rely, at least in part, on encouraging voluntary behaviour change amongst consumers. © 2014 Editorial matter and selection: Scott A.

It is built on a cognitive human response model, incorporates strong elements of current HRA good practices, leverages lessons learned from empirical studies, and takes advantage of the best features of existing and emerging HRA methods. The original framework of Phoenix was introduced in previous publications. This paper reports of the completed methodology, summarizing the steps and techniques of its qualitative analysis phase. The methodology introduces the ""crew response tree"" which provides a structure for capturing the context associated with human failure events (HFEs), including errors of omission and commission. It also uses a team-centered version of the Information, Decision and Action cognitive model and ""macro cognitive"" abstractions of crew behavior, as well as relevant findings from cognitive psychology literature and operating experience, to identify potential causes of failures and influencing factors during procedure-driven and knowledge-supported crew-plant interactions. The result is the set of identified HFEs and likely scenarios leading to each. The methodology itself is generic in the sense that it is compatible with various quantification methods, and can be applied across various environments including nuclear, oil and gas, aerospace, and aviation."

They allow for proactive identification of possible hazards and the use of risk management tools to mitigate risks aspects of a Safety Management System (SMS). These tools provide ways for airlines to predetermine which flights and schedules may have more risk and allow operators to intervene and proactively reduce risk when possible. This process allows the operator to identify inherent risk built into flight schedules to maximize alertness. This adds another layer to the operators' safety management systems. Current fatigue prediction models do not account for light/night effect on alertness levels. The effects of light on alertness have been well established and could be built into fatigue risk management systems. Recent research conducted by Brown et al., (2014) examined whether timed ocular light exposure could mitigate fatigue, reducing physiological, perceived and cognitive fatigue-to transform aviation alertness models [4]. The availability of this information opens up a new range of possibilities, making it possible to ""build"" light/dark effect into crew alertness models and scheduling tools to improve aviation safety, crewmember health and manage risk."

The Act of the People’s Republic of China on the Application of Laws in Foreign-Related Civil Relations of 2010 (PIL-Act) not only brings developments and changes to conflict rules for tort in general, but also provide choice-of-law rules for product liability, infringement of the right of personality via the internet and liability arising from an infringement of intellectual property rights, which marks that Chinese conflicts law has entered into a new developmental stage and taken on several new trends: (1) Chinese conflicts law system for torts has been basically set up; (2) Chinese choice-of-law rules for torts are becoming more and more diversified; (3) the principle of party autonomy has been fully introduced to tort liability; and (4) judicial interpretations issued or to be issued by the Supreme People’s Court will still play an important role in judicial practice. © 2017, Brill Academic Publishers.

"Why tourism mobility behaviours must change","2014","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015611796&partnerID=40&md5=eaeab3e85e51b74f345349c024305804","There now exists a general scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is an inescapable reality (IPCC, 2007). The climate science has been subject to, and withstood, “withering scrutiny” (Garnaut, 2008). The consequences of climate change - social, economic, environmental - will be far reaching (Stern, 2007). The critical challenge that must be taken up without delay is to achieve “radical emission reductions” in all sectors of the economy, and across all aspects of society. The climate crisis, which demands the transformation of our lives and societies (Monbiot, 2007), raises difficult questions for consumer-based neoliberal western societies (Harvey, 2011; Stern, 2007). One important but problematic aspect of the required transformation relates to contemporary western mobility (Gössling et al., 2010). In singling out transport, Cuenot (2013, p. 22) of The International Energy Agency suggests that “Transport offers the easiest path for reducing oil dependency in theory: simple readily available solutions promise a 30% to 50% improvement in fuel economy, depending on the country, while reducing carbon emissions by several gigatonnes of CO2 each year”. Wheeller (2012, p. 39), however, focusing on tourist transport, unpacks a simple paradox: “All tourism involves travel: all travel involves transport: no form of transport is sustainable: so how on earth can we have sustainable tourism?” While some modes of transport (e.g. human, electrical, solar powered) are more sustainable than others, the sustainability of high volume, high velocity, long distance transportation is clearly coming under increasing scrutiny (Peeters and Dubois, 2010). The situation is particularly acute in the case of discretionary air travel (Cohen et al., 2011; Gössling et al., 2010). Monbiot (2007) highlights the considerable challenge associated with mitigating aviation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, given high current and projected growth in demand for air travel, and the absence of significant scope for further technical gains in aircraft efficiency (Scott et al., 2010). In the absence of “game-changing” innovations in transport technology, it is clearly evident that the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Tourism Barometer 2012 forecast of 1.8 billion international travellers by 2030 is incompatible with carbon mitigation. Western governments and the industry have to date been unwilling - or unable - to make meaningful responses to the tourism transport emissions challenge. The continuing inability to bring aviation into emission trading schemes (ETS) is indicative of this impasse (Duval, 2013). As many other sectors actively respond to the call for radical emissions reduction (Scott, 2011; Scott et al., 2012), tourism could find itself generating up to 40 per cent of global carbon emissions by 2050 (Dubois and Ceron, 2006; Gössling and Peeters, 2007). This failure of response is producing an industry of environmental disregard and neglect, with contemporary tourism that may be considered profligate and dissolute. It is clearly evident that “technology and management will not be sufficient to achieve even modest absolute emission reductions” (Gössling et al., 2010, p. 119). This, according to Gössling et al. (2010), confirms that social and behavioural change is necessary to achieve climatically sustainable tourism. Indeed the UNWTO concedes that climatically sustainable tourism requires fundamental shifts in consumer behaviour (UNWTO-UNEP-WMO, 2008). However, reliance upon shifts in behaviour raises its own issues and challenges (Semenza et al., 2008). Despite evidence of growing public awareness of the impacts of air transport on climate change (Hares et al., 2010; Higham and Cohen, 2011) there remains an alarming disconnection between attitudes and (tourist) behaviour (Miller et al., 2010). Thus, an increasingly informed and concerned public, which is beginning to internalise the realities of the climate crisis (Cohen and Higham, 2011), displays few signs of behaviour change (Barr et al., 2010; Higham et al., 2014; McKercher et al., 2010). The efficacy of individual consumers bearing the costs (social, economic) and responsibilities (psychological, behavioural) of a profoundly (environmentally) unsustainable industry is clearly open to question. From this overall context, the Freiburg 2012 workshop, held in Freiburg im Breisgau in southern Germany (3-5 July, 2012) set out to explore the psychological and social factors that both contribute to and inhibit behaviour change vis-à-vis sustainable (tourist) mobility. The workshop provided an opportunity to advance a rigorous and theoretically informed knowledge base and research agenda for effective policy interventions to address tourism’s contribution to climate change. Such insights are of importance to policy makers, as policy interventions will be less effective if not based on a rigorous understanding of tourist behaviour and psychology. These understandings are needed to negotiate or remove barriers that policy makers may perceive in implementing stronger mitigation measures by signalling how such measures can be made palatable to the public. The psychological and behavioural insights achieved during the workshop informed discussion of government approaches and policy measures that are required to both (a) support the efforts of individuals/consumers to respond to the emission reduction challenge, and (b) conflate the onus of responsibility (and the anxieties of consumption fuelled climate change) from the level of the individual, to the collective levels of government, industry and economy. © 2014 Editorial matter and selection: Scott A.

This is the view, for instance, of the German sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920), who argued that modern societies are “characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the ‘disenchantment of the world.’” The new technologies that proliferated in the Modernist period, however, triggered sensations of Aristotelian wonder and, I will argue, reenchantment among the moderns. They enhanced our ability to see, hear, travel, discover, and comprehend, and in the process, they reconfigured our understanding of the self. One need only think of the advent of telephony, the X-ray, cinematography, and aviation, which at their inception appeared like forms of modern magic: To speak to a person in a different city from the comfort of one’s home, to peer inside the human body without cutting it open, to capture image and movement on celluloid formaldehyde, and to fly across the continent in a matter of hours figured among the transformative inventions of the turn of the century, whether experienced vicariously by the masses or first hand by the privileged few. New technologies functioned as markers of human ingenuity. They multiplied manyfold our sensory and motor capacities and, by proxy, our potential for further discovery and innovation. In the second half of the nineteenth century, for instance, advances in lens technology led to more powerful microscopes, which in turn inaugurated the study of bacteriology, with dramatic improvements in health care and food hygiene. The process of pasteurization, still in use today, has its origins in Louis Pasteur’s (1822–1895) bacteriological research. Pasteur also contributed to the development of immunization through vaccination, which worked by triggering the body’s own immune mechanism. The technological and scientific discoveries of the period seemed to point to and draw on analogies rather than discrepancies between the human organism and technology. Darwinian thought, experimental psychology, and Freud’s theory of the unconscious drew attention to the essentially automatic functions of the human body, which operated outside of the realm of agency and free will and gradually led to the emergence of a new conception of the self. These innovations raised anxieties about the limits of the human and paved the way to a posthumanist conception of the self. © Cambridge University Press 2015."

The projects aim to develop concepts and technologies that could support the development of micro (personal) and macro (colony) greenhouses in space, and to investigate medical issues related to the human body's need for interaction with and consumption of plant materials during space travel. One goal is to investigate the principles asserted in this paper using test scenarios executed by astronauts and people on Earth working in collaboration. Examples are given of past science experiments conducted in a similar fashion. Two artworks by the author are discussed, the Homesickness Kit and the Exosomatic Bio-Helmet (concept stage). Justification for the art-research projects is taken from astronaut testimonials, space medicine and space psychology literature, as well as published research on greenhouses currently used or in development for Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the International Space Station. While the author's projects are speculative in nature, this paper lays the groundwork for such thought-experiments to benefit technical habitability developments in spacecraft and to improve the quality of life in space."
"Norwegian airline passengers are not more afraid of flying after the terror act of September 11. The flight anxiety, however, is significantly attributed to acts of terrorism","2014","Scandinavian Journal of Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927799191&partnerID=40&md5=3cbd49428dcfc87e7b07c838f16f2b6c","The aim of this paper is to study: (1) the prevalence of flight anxiety among Norwegian airline passengers; (2) situations that may be of concern during flights and situations not related to flying; (3) whether passengers feel more afraid after the terror act of September 11, 2001; and (4) whether passengers were more afraid in 2002 than in 1986.A questionnaire was distributed during domestic flights in Norway in 1986 and 2002. To asses flight anxiety, a six point scale was used, from 0 = not afraid at all, to 5 = always very afraid, and sometimes avoid flying because of that. A 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure the degree of anxiety. There were 50.8% who were not afraid at all. There were 12 women (5.2%) and one man (0.4%) with flight phobia. However, 22 (4.5%) had cancelled flights because of anxiety during the last two years. Situations that caused most concern during flights were turbulence and fear of terrorism and highjacking. After September 11, 48% were not more afraid, 38% a little more, 10% moderately, 3% rather much and 2% very much. The passengers, however, were not more afraid of flying in 2002 than in 1986. About 3% of Norwegian airline passengers have a flight phobia. Women are significantly more concerned than men. The impact of the terror act September 11, 2001 was rather moderate.

"Parachuting and pregnancy: What do we know about pregnant skydivers and the risks they are taking?","2014","Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927631575&partnerID=40&md5=24588196831060db83501cc02275b16e","Objective: There is little medical knowledge about the risks of skydiving during pregnancy. Some national parachuting associations ask for a doctor's permission; others recommend not jumping at all during pregnancy. This article provides survey data and a literature review of pregnancy and parachuting/skydiving related issues to help the pregnant skydiver and her obstetrician make an informed decision. Survey data presented include pregnancy, delivery, and parachuting information from skydivers who jumped during pregnancy. Design: International retrospective anonymous online questionnaire considering the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIE). The PubMed database was searched with using the terms ""skydive,"" ""pregnancy,"" and ""parachute"" (query April 2013). Setting: Web page questionnaire on skydivers' epidemiology, experience, and pregnancy-related information. Participants: Fifty-seven parous female skydivers. Assessment of Risk Factors: Information on athletes' experience, weather conditions, obstetric history (gravida, gestational week), delivery mode was obtained. Main Outcome Measures: Epidemiology of pregnant skydivers and literature review to provide information on skydiving risks. Results: Women do actively decide to skydive while pregnant. The majority of our participants were between 25-year-old and 35-yearold primips with 100 to 1000 jumps experience, answering the questionnaire from a European IP address. Precautions are taken in terms of weather conditions, gear, or sports partner. The literature review found no relevant literature regarding the question. Literature is searched for risk factors that come close to the ones in skydiving (ie, oxygen saturation, shock forces, and others). Further studies are needed to show the long-term effect of stress or low O<inf>2</inf> saturation on antenatal programming, or short-term hypoxia and pregnancy outcome in pregnant skydiving women and their offspring. Conclusions: Pregnancy itself is a risk factor for injuries. Injuries in pregnancy are clearly associated with an unfavorable pregnancy outcome. The recommendation ""do not skydive during pregnancy"" is the safest approach. A possible lesser risk alternative to skydiving could be wind-tunnel training. Clinical Relevance: This article provides insights into the pregnant skydiver's decision making regarding the sports. In combination with the literature review, we provide up-to-date easy to understand information on the possible risk factors. This is a valuable source of information for the care providers of female skydivers to understand and compare the risk factors of this sport. With this information, the professional recommendation and relationship are strengthened. This article also guides the need for further research. Possible research areas include pregnancy and sports-related risk factors, placentation and prenatal programming, physical and psychological factors associated with skydiving. © © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

This study utilized two measuring instruments on a sample that consisted of 83 pilots and a third instrument on a sample of 52 female pilots and non-pilots. The three measurement instruments used where the Aviation Gender Attitude Questionnaire (AGAQ) to measure gender bias and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) to measure stress among female pilots and the Armstrong Laboratories Aviation Personality Survey (ALAPS) to measure personality dimensions of female pilots. There was a significant difference found between males and females across all factors. While this study concurred with research that suggests that female pilots are at greater risk for negative perceptions and sexism by male pilots, this study did not indicate any greater degrees of depression, stress, or anxiety in females as compared to their male counterparts. However, this study found that female pilots were more like their male counterparts than females as a whole, thus allowing females to fit easer into the more male dominated workplace."

For nonnative speakers, the effect of noise on performance is more severe than their native counterparts. What remains unknown is the effectiveness of countermeasures such as noise attenuating devices in such circumstances. Therefore, the main aim of the present research was to examine the effectiveness of active noise attenuating countermeasures in the presence of simulated aircraft noise for both native and nonnative English speakers. Thirty-two participants, half native English speakers and half native German speakers completed four recognition (cued) recall tasks presented in English under four different audio conditions, all in the presence of simulated aircraft noise. The results of the research indicated that in simulated aircraft noise at 65 dB(A), performance of nonnative English speakers was poorer than for native English speakers. The beneficial effects of noise cancelling headphones in improving the signal to noise ratio led to an improved performance for nonnative speakers. These results have particular importance for organizations operating in a safety-critical environment such as aviation."
"The good and bad of group conformity: A call for a new programme of research in medical education","2014","Medical Education","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905687555&partnerID=40&md5=56df7b5959ce238604c0b3cce5031b2b","Context: Given that a significant portion of medical education occurs in various social settings (small groups, large classes, clinical environments), it is critical to examine how group members interact. One type of influence on these interactions is conformity, whereby an individual changes his or her own behaviour to match incorrect responses of others in a group. Conformity to peer pressure has been replicated in experimental research conducted in many countries over the last 60 years. There is newly emerging empirical evidence of this effect in medical education, suggesting that subtle motivations and pressures within a group may prevent students from challenging or questioning information that seems incorrect. Objectives: This narrative review aims to present an overview of theory and findings in research into conformity in the fields of social psychology, business, sociology and aviation theory to demonstrate its direct relevance to medical education and the health professions. Methods: We searched online databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and ProQuest) from the University of Calgary catalogue. We also searched citations in articles reviewed and references provided by colleagues. We limited our narrative review to publications released between 1950 and 2012. Results: Group conformity behaviour may be one of a number of communication challenges associated with interprofessional care, and may represent a factor contributing to the burden of adverse events. This paper calls for a new programme of research into conformity in medical education that provides systematic empirical evidence of its relevance and applications in education, health care and practice. Conclusions: This review reveals decades of anecdotal and empirical evidence that conformity is a pervasive phenomenon across disciplines. Further research is needed to elucidate which situations pose the greatest risk for the occurrence of conformity, how to manage it in practice and its implications for patient safety. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The magnitude of cognitive interference on color-word, numerical and emotional Stroop paradigms was studied during a baseline recording and right before the test flight. Cardio-respiratory parameters were simultaneously assessed during rest and the performance of the Stroop tasks. Cognitive data suggested a different speed/accuracy trade-off under stress, and no modulation of the interference effect for color words or numerical stimuli. However, we observed a major increase in error rates for specific emotional stimuli related to the evaluation situation in the stress condition. The increase in cognitive interference from emotional stimuli, expressed as an increase in error rates, was correlated to the decreased cardiac reactivity to challenge in the stress situation. This relationship is discussed in the framework of Sanders' (1983) model of stress and performance. In terms of future research, this link warrants a fruitful lead to be followed for investigating the causal mechanism of performance decrements under the influence of stress. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

We examined for the first time the effects of stress and stress-induced cortisol increases on detection performance of hidden weapons in an x-ray baggage screening task. We randomly assigned 48 participants either to a stress or a nonstress group. The stress group was exposed to a standardized psychosocial stress test (TSST). Before and after stress/nonstress, participants had to detect threat objects in a computer-based object recognition test (X-ray ORT). We repeatedly measured salivary cortisol and X-ray ORT performance before and after stress/nonstress. Cortisol increases in reaction to psychosocial stress induction but not to nonstress independently impaired x-ray detection performance. Our results suggest that stress-induced cortisol increases at peak reactivity impair x-ray screening performance. © 2014 Society for Psychophysiological Research."

"Failure to detect critical auditory alerts in the cockpit: Evidence for inattentional deafness","2014","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84900536496&partnerID=40&md5=721b2deadde6fa735b0401af7c4b11c3","Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether inattentional deafness to critical alarms would be observed in a simulated cockpit. Background: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (e.g., alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking. Method: Twenty-eight general aviation pilots performed two landings in a flight simulator. In one scenario an auditory alert was triggered alone, whereas in the other the auditory alert occurred while the pilots dealt with a critical windshear. Results: In the windshear scenario, 11 pilots (39.3%) did not report or react appropriately to the alarm whereas all the pilots perceived the auditory warning in the no-windshear scenario. Also, of those pilots who were first exposed to the no-windshear scenario and detected the alarm, only three suffered from inattentional deafness in the subsequent windshear scenario. Conclusion: These findings establish inattentional deafness as a cognitive phenomenon that is critical for air safety. Pre-exposure to a critical event triggering an auditory alarm can enhance alarm detection when a similar event is encountered subsequently. Application: Case-based learning is a solution to mitigate auditory alarm misperception. © 2013, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Six male professional Australian football (soccer) players were recruited to participate in the study. Data were collected from 12 matches, which included 6 home and away matches against the same 4 teams. Together with the outcome of each match, data were obtained for team technical and tactical performance indicators and individual player-movement patterns. Furthermore, sleep quantity and quality, hydration, and perceptual fatigue were measured 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after each match. More competition points were accumulated (P > .05, d = 1.10) and fewer goals were conceded (P > .05, d = 0.93) in home than in away matches. Furthermore, more shots on goal (P > .05, d = 1.17) and corners (P > .05, d = 1.45) and fewer opposition shots on goal (P > .05, d = 1.18) and corners (P <.05, d = 2.32) occurred, alongside reduced total distance covered (P > .05, d = 1.19) and low-intensity activity (P < .05, d = 2.25) during home than during away matches. However, while oxygen saturation was significantly lower during than before and after outbound and return travel (P < .01), equivocal differences in sleep quantity and quality, hydration, and perceptual fatigue were observed before and after competition away compared with home. These results suggest that, compared with short-haul air travel, factors including situational variables, territoriality, tactics, and athlete psychological state are more important in determining match outcome. Furthermore, despite the potential for disrupted recovery patterns, return travel did not impede player recovery or perceived readiness to train. © 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc."

A review of different crew-automation conflicting scenarios shows that they have a common denominator: the autopilot behaviour interferes with the pilot's goal regarding the flight guidance via 'hidden' mode transitions. Considering both the human operator and the machine (i.e. the autopilot or the decision functions) as agents, we propose a Petri net model of those conflicting interactions, which allows them to be detected as deadlocks in the Petri net. In order to test our Petri net model, we designed an autoflight system that was formally analysed to detect conflicting situations. We identified three conflicting situations that were integrated in an experimental scenario in a flight simulator with 10 general aviation pilots. The results showed that the conflicts that we had a-priori identified as critical had impacted the pilots' performance. Indeed, the first conflict remained unnoticed by eight participants and led to a potential collision with another aircraft. The second conflict was detected by all the participants but three of them did not manage the situation correctly. The last conflict was also detected by all the participants but provoked typical automation surprise situation as only one declared that he had understood the autopilot behaviour. These behavioural results are discussed in terms of workload and number of fired 'hidden' transitions. Eventually, this study reveals that both formal and experimental approaches are complementary to identify and assess the criticality of human-automation conflicts.Practitioner Summary: We propose a Petri net model of human-automation conflicts. An experiment was conducted with general aviation pilots performing a scenario involving three conflicting situations to test the soundness of our formal approach.

Participants were 170 USAF officers with RPA Initial Flight Screening (RFS) outcomes and 110 USAF officers with RPA Instrument Qualification (RIQ) outcomes. Both RFS and RIQ emphasize development of skills traditionally required for manned aircraft pilots, also considered essential for USAF RPA pilots. Results showed significant negative relationships between the Big Five personality trait of Openness and several RPA training outcomes, and significant incremental variance explained by Openness beyond other predictors. Additionally, RFS and RIQ training outcomes were generally predicted by measures traditionally used for selection into manned aircraft pilot training courses and careers. Together, these findings suggest that personality, specifically Openness scores, and scores on traditional pilot selection measures, can serve as useful indicators in the early identification of RPA pilot talent. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

This leads to the postulate that the application domain from which a conceptualization of SA arises plays a fundamental role in that conceptualization. To test this postulate, we compare SA accounts originating from three different domains - Aviation, military command and control, and process control. The comparison of the three SA accounts illustrates that the domain of origin can have significant influence on the fundamental characterization of SA. In particular, the choices for the research paradigm in psychology, cognitive components (e.g., metacognition), orientation of time, and scaling of time can be partly traced back to properties or operator challenges specific to the domains of origin. Our comparison demonstrates that domain properties must be carefully examined for conceptualization and application of the SA notion. Copyright 2013 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc."

This book, Aeromedical Psychology, is designed to provide the means for a variety of clinicians to carry out sound assessment and selection procedures, perform informed evaluations and make subsequent recommendations regarding flight status and treatment strategies geared to the aviation environment. To facilitate a dynamic understanding of the field, the book emphasizes an integration of applications and theory, case examples and research. The book is divided into three parts. The first presents assessment and selection procedures for aviation personnel (i.e. air traffic controllers, flight officers and pilots) and astronauts and the many ways in which both psychologists and psychiatrists are involved in these roles. In the second part, the waiver standards put forth by both the FAA and the various branches of the military are presented, as well as the waiver decision process. Clinical issues unique to aviation - notably fear of flying, motivation to fly and airsickness - are addressed, as well as possible courses of intervention, treatment and disposition. In the final part, more specialized issues pertaining to aeromedical psychology are dealt with, namely the psychopharmacological research and regulations applicable to recreational pilots and aviation personnel, managing the aftermath of aviation mishaps and the psychologist's role in accident investigations. © Carrie H.

A significant proportion of adverse events can be attributed to inadequate team-based skills such as communication, leadership, situation awareness and resource utilization. Aviation-based crisis resource management (CRM) training using high-fidelity simulation has been proposed as a strategy to improve team behaviours. This review will address key considerations in CRM training and outline recommendations for the future of human factors education in healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: A critical examination of the current literature yields several important considerations to guide the development and implementation of effective simulation-based CRM training. These include defining a priori domain-specific objectives, creating an immersive environment that encourages deliberate practice and transfer-Appropriate processing, and the importance of effective team debriefing. Building on research from high-risk industry, we suggest that traditional CRM training may be augmented with new training techniques that promote the development of shared mental models for team and task processes, address the effect of acute stress on team performance, and integrate strategies to improve clinical reasoning and the detection of cognitive errors. SUMMARY: The evolution of CRM training involves a 'Triple Threat' approach that integrates mental model theory for team and task processes, training for stressful situations and metacognition and error theory towards a more comprehensive training paradigm, with roots in high-risk industry and cognitive psychology. Further research is required to evaluate the impact of this approach on patient-oriented outcomes. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

However, less has been published regarding cognitive dysfunction resulting from hypoxia produced by exposure to different altitudes. Methods: We measured short-term and working memory capacity (Digit Span tasks), cognitive flexibility and selective attention (Word-Color Stroop Task), and executive functioning (Trailmaking A and B tests) at baseline and simulated altitudes equal to 17,500 ft (5334 m) and 25,000 ft (7620 m) in order to obtain more information about the role of altitude exposure on cognitive tasks important for optimal functioning in the aviation environment. Results: Behavioral observations indicated that hypoxia was induced at different simulated altitudes. Marked declines in cognitive performance were also observed for all tests at 25,000 ft, with scores indicating greater impairment in this condition relative to others. Subjects also showed greater impairment when scores obtained in the 17,500-ft condition were compared to baseline, although the effects were not as clearly defined relative to the 25,000 vs. baseline contrasts. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that electronic versions of these tests may be useful in screening for acute symptoms of hypoxia and could provide insight into how discrete cognitive processes become impaired with oxygen deprivation at various altitudes. Given that these tests also assess neuropsychological functioning, our results allow for inferences to be made about the effects of hypoxia on human brain functioning. © by the Aerospace Medical Association."

However, the findings from this research have been inconsistent. Studies have varied with respect to the identification of causal variables and the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms underlying performance. Drawing on the ecological rationality approach, we present a theory of the judgment and decision-making processes involved in a relative judgment task that explains how people judge a stimulus and adapt their decision process to accommodate their own uncertainty associated with those judgments. Undergraduate participants performed a simulated air traffic control conflict detection task. Across two experiments, we systematically manipulated variables known to affect performance. In the first experiment, we manipulated the relative distances of aircraft to a common destination while holding aircraft speeds constant. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced a direct manipulation of relative speed. We then fit a sequential sampling model to the data, and used the best fitting parameters to infer the decision-making processes responsible for performance. Findings were consistent with the theory that people adapt to their own uncertainty by adjusting their criterion and the amount of time they take to collect evidence in order to make a more accurate decision. From a practical perspective, the paper demonstrates that one can use a sequential sampling model to understand performance in a dynamic environment, allowing one to make sense of and interpret complex patterns of empirical findings that would otherwise be difficult to interpret using standard statistical analyses © 2013 American Psychological Association."

We provide evidence that comprehensively challenges that view. First, we develop and confirm the structure of a 3-factor measure of motives: the Sensation Seeking, Emotion Regulation, and Agency Scale (SEAS; Study 1). We then use the SEAS to provide evidence of differential motives for 2 high-risk activities: skydiving and mountaineering. The motive for skydiving is strongly associated with sensation seeking; the motive for mountaineering is strongly associated with emotion regulation and agency but not with sensation seeking (Study 2). We also show that these conclusions cannot be drawn from existing measures of personality and sensation seeking (Study 3). Finally, individuals who are motivated by emotion regulation and agency needs also have greater expectations regarding their emotion regulation and agency. It is these greater expectations that most successfully discriminate mountaineers from skydivers and control participants (Study 4). It is concluded that researchers should no longer consider risk takers as a homogenous sensation-seeking group and that they should consider risk taking as a potential model of human endeavor. The SEAS can be used as a measure of motives for behavior whenever sensation seeking, agency, or emotion regulation is thought to be at the core of such motives, and the results are discussed in the context of encouraging personality researchers to consider the specific spontaneous behaviors that motivate different people. © 2013 American Psychological Association."

The rarity of these alarms associated with their possible unreliability may play a role in this misperception. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we manipulated both audiovisual conflict and sound rarity in a simplified landing task. Behavioral data and event related potentials (ERPs) of thirteen healthy participants were analyzed. We found that the presentation of a rare auditory signal (i.e. an alarm), incongruent with visual information, led to a smaller amplitude of the auditory N100 (i.e. less negative) compared to the condition in which both signals were congruent. Moreover, the incongruity between the visual information and the rare sound did not significantly affect reaction times, suggesting that the rare sound was neglected. We propose that the lower N100 amplitude reflects an early visual-to-auditory gating that depends on the rarity of the sound. In complex aircraft environments, this early effect might be partly responsible for auditory alarm insensitivity. Our results provide a new basis for future aeronautic studies and the development of countermeasures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

In the latent stage, psychology, types and demand of passengers need to be fully considered, such as four principles (respond fast, keep staff present, let the leader on duty come to coordinate and provide both standard and personal services), six arrangements (elementary service, delay information, travel arrangement, compensation plan, complaint channel, track investigation), so as to prevent and control outbreak of mass incidents of passengers. In the outbreak stage, the airline should isolate the key passengers and contact the airport police and media. In the subside stage, the airline should evacuate passengers as soon as possible."
"Introducing Survival Ethics into Engineering Education and Practice","2013","Science and Engineering Ethics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878291678&partnerID=40&md5=23565ed4ddd2beab334ed97b2239ac71","Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life. This crisis calls for an ethics that furnishes effective motives to take global action necessary for survival. We propose a research program for understanding why ethical principles change across time and culture. We also propose provisional motives and methods for reaching global consensus on engineering field ethics. Current interdisciplinary research in ethics, psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary theory grounds these proposals. Experimental ethics, the application of scientific principles to ethical studies, provides a model for developing policies to advance solutions. A growing literature proposes evolutionary explanations for moral development. Connecting these approaches necessitates an experimental or scientific ethics that deliberately examines theories of morality for reliability. To illustrate how such an approach works, we cover three areas. The first section analyzes cross-cultural ethical systems in light of evolutionary theory. While such research is in its early stages, its assumptions entail consequences for engineering education. The second section discusses Howard University and University of Puerto Rico/Mayagüez (UPRM) courses that bring ethicists together with scientists and engineers to unite ethical theory and practice. We include a syllabus for engineering and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) ethics courses and a checklist model for translating educational theory and practice into community action. The model is based on aviation, medicine and engineering practice. The third and concluding section illustrates Howard University and UPRM efforts to translate engineering educational theory into community action. Multidisciplinary teams of engineering students and instructors take their expertise from the classroom to global communities to examine further the ethicality of prospective technologies and the decision-making processes that lead to them. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

The study sample consisted of 193 commercial airline pilots from China Southern Airlines Ltd. The results showed that internal locus of control directly affected pilot safety operation behavior. Risk perception seemed to mediate the relationship between locus of control and safety operation behaviors, and total flight time moderated internal locus of control. Thus, locus of control primarily influences safety operation behavior indirectly by affecting risk perception. The total effect of internal locus of control on safety behaviors is larger than that of external locus of control. Furthermore, the safety benefit of flight experience is more pronounced among pilots with high internal loci of control in the early and middle flight building stages. Practical implications for aviation safety and directions for future research are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Background: Error-encouragement training is said to be more effective than error-avoidance training because active exploration and error encouragement promote better learning and transfer. Past research, which is limited by confounded experimental designs involving simple tasks with little consideration of individual differences, provides evidence for the value of active exploration but less so for error encouragement. Method: We randomly allocated 164 participants to receive error-encouragement, error-avoidance, or no error-related instructions in training on ATC-lab, a dynamic computer simulated air traffic control task. Active exploration and task information were controlled, and ability and personality were assessed. Results: Error encouragement yielded better transfer performance than did error avoidance but was no better than the control training. Higher- rather than lower-ability trainees benefited from training with an error orientation (positive or negative), suggesting that learning from errors in training requires greater cognitive resources. Trainees higher in openness to experience and agreeableness performed more poorly with error-avoidance training than with error-encouragement and control training. Conclusion: Error-avoidance training had a detrimental effect especially for those less open to experience, lower in agreeableness, and of lower ability. The significant benefits of error-encouragement training reported in previous research were probably attributable to confounding factors, such as active exploration and differential task information. Application: Although errors and active exploration can be useful learning tools in training, trainers should be mindful that focusing on errors, whether positively or negatively, may not suit everyone.

We assessed the impact of the presence of visual feedback about gaze position and the method of target selection on selection performance under different difficulty levels induced by variations in target size and target-to-target separation. We tend to consider that the combined use of gaze dwell-time selection and continuous eye-gaze feedback was the best condition as it suits naturally with gaze displacement over the ATC display and free the hands of the controller, despite a small cost in terms of selection speed. In addition, target size had a greater impact on accuracy and selection time than target distance.

We sought to unify a fragmented literature and assess the efficacy of debriefs with a quantitative review. Background: Used by the U.S. Army to improve performance for decades, and increasingly in medical, aviation, and other communities, debriefs systematize reflection, discussion, and goal setting to promote experiential learning. Unfortunately, research and theory on debriefing has been spread across diverse disciplines, so it has been difficult to definitively ascertain debriefing effectiveness and how to enhance its effectiveness. Method: We conducted an extensive quantitative meta-analysis across a diverse body of published and unpublished research on team- and individual-level debriefs. Results: Findings from 46 samples (N = 2,136) indicate that on average, debriefs improve effectiveness over a control group by approximately 25% (d = .67). Average effect sizes were similar for teams and individuals, across simulated and real settings, for withinor between-group control designs, and for medical and nonmedical samples. Meta-analytic methods revealed a bolstering effect of alignment and the potential impact of facilitation and structure. Conclusion: Organizations can improve individual and team performance by approximately 20% to 25% by using properly conducted debriefs. Application: Debriefs are a relatively inexpensive and quick intervention for enhancing performance. Our results lend support for continued and expanded use of debriefing in training and in situ. To gain maximum results, it is important to ensure alignment between participants, focus and intent, and level of measurement. Copyright © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Existing literature on human error, operational decision making, and industrial psychology is combined with the authors' experiences in researching these problems and working with operations teams. The nontechnical skills required to manage operations effectively are described together with the organizational structures and work processes that best support operations. Techniques for training teams and helping them to develop the competencies to manage operations safely and to deal with uncertainty are explained. Mindful that ""proper planning prevents poor performance,"" engineers go to considerable lengths to create quality plans. A structured well-delivery process is followed, complete with peer reviews, risk assessments, and technical sign-offs. Deliverables include statements of requirements, basis-of-design documents, hazard identification (HAZID) sessions, drill-the-well-on-paper meetings, and a drilling program. Despite these preparations, teams make decisions during operations with sometimes costly consequences, especially when surprised by an unexpected event or when facing high levels of uncertainty. This problem is not unusual and typically occurs when a project team fails to prepare and actively manage its transition from planning to operations, and to anticipate the necessary change in the functions of the team. Planning and operations require completely different mindsets. The lack of preparation for this transition stems from a common assumption that the team that has performed the planning is more than capable of managing a dynamic operation effectively. Research has identified that two different modes are required-during the planning phase, teams produce a plan designed to solve a problem, whereas during operations the team has to manage a task requiring the ability to adapt dynamically to shifting demands of th,e situation. Effective operations management requires both a high degree of operational discipline and teams that are skilled in dealing with the unexpected and making decisions in time-constrained situations. These skills are not intuitive and must be taught, trained, practiced, and assessed. The protocols and decision rights must be clear, and the team must be trained so that it executes these functions in a fluent and competent manner. The oil industry lacks an international regulatory framework enjoyed by aviation. It lacks even basic standardization about how rigs are operated, wells are drilled, and operations are monitored. These are essential prerequisites for an environment within which a standardized operational discipline can be developed and implemented. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to propose a framework for operational governance within which the development of nontechnical-skills training can be built.

Competent and conscientious physicians rarely recall making a single cognitive error, yet this must be central to the explanation for inappropriate physician nonadherence to evidence-based guidelines. Published information regarding cognitive error in the medical literature is scarce and widely scattered. We do know that cognitive error is induced by complexity, duress, and uncertainty, conditions that regularly confront long term care physicians when they assume care of a new patient at the skilled nursing facility. Negative attitudes and low expectations of care are common among new patients and families. This is compounded when care is assumed by an unfamiliar physician. The initial disquiet and negative misconceptions of patients and families regularly make the transition one of the most error-prone events in medical practice. On the brighter side, the transition provides an excellent opportunity to study cognitive error. Cognitive errors at transition typically begin with a decision to avoid mention of necessary changes to flawed treatment plans already in effect. This is done as a temporary measure to avoid further stressing the patient and family. But what appears to be an ideal compromise is a risky option and should be avoided. Evading the issue introduces long-term risk to the patient. In addition, although it is seldom acknowledged, evading change often has a negative impact on local standards of care. Five cognitive principles are presented as root causes of cognitive error. Six contextual factors are identified that are endemic to nursing home practice, making the physician even more error prone. Because mistrust is central to dysfunctional decision making at the transition, strategies are presented to expedite gaining trust. This article makes the case for adding training in the cognitive psychology of medical decision making to core requirements for certification in medical direction. © 2013 American Medical Directors Association, Inc."

In the aftermath of these events, one wonders whether learning from accidents remains a viable endeavour for companies and states or whether recurring technological disasters such as these seriously and definitely undermine any attempt to prove the feasibility of learning. Progress has certainly been made in the past, but apparently not enough so to be able to reach the highest safety levels, even in systems with dedicated resources. As a result of the current situation, some have been able to argue that '. we don't learn about disasters'. Although appealing and right, this is a very generic statement. There are many studies addressing aspects of learning from accidents which are in a position to bring insights about the drawbacks of learning. But this wealth of research is also part of the problem. When one wants to step back and to look broadly at the topic, to understand the reason why '. we don't learn', one is left with a fragmented scientific literature covering a very large spectrum of interests and views on the subject. This paper tackles this problem by first designing a framework to organise the diversity of studies and second, by extracting four lessons on learning from accidents, putting together for this purpose works in psychology, sociology and political science. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

In what way can a flight crew mediate problems? How are we to understand reported errors? Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety presents recent findings in aviation psychology, bringing fresh insights to such questions. Aviation psychologists study personnel selection and training; they evaluate the management of flight operations, and ultimately they analyse the things that went wrong. The strong interrelation between these components allows us to talk about a chain of safety. This volume appraises this chain of safety by considering the mechanisms that determine its effectiveness - input mechanisms, coping mechanisms and control mechanisms. Each contribution discusses a component of the chain while the book as a whole emphasizes and illustrates that understanding the connections between these parts is essential for the future. By addressing these issues the book leads to further considerations such as how mistakes are linked to training and how coping mechanisms should help us to understand errors and accidents. Mechanisms in the Chain of Safety will appeal to aviation professionals (human factors experts, safety managers, pilots, ATCOs, air navigation service providers, etc.) and academics, researchers, graduates and postgraduates in human factors and psychology. Although primarily written for the aviation industry, this book will also be of interest to other high-risk dynamic activities that face similar challenges: the need to present effective and safe outcomes to the public in general and the stakeholders in particular. © Alex de Voogt and Teresa C.

Results: Participants responded significantly more rapidly, but no less accurately, to conflicts when presented with an additional auditory or audiotactile cue than with either a vibrotactile or visual cue alone. Conclusion: Auditory and audiotactile cues have the potential for improving operator performance by reducing the time it takes to detect and respond to potential visual target events. Application: These results have important implications for the design and use of multisensory cues in air traffic management. © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

It is extremely frustrating to suffer blanket bans and many examples exist, including insurance, driving licenses, getting a job, keeping a job and family affairs.In this article, an example is given of how pilots with insulin treated diabetes are allowed to fly by taking the responsibility of using special blood glucose monitoring protocols. At this time the systems in the countries allowing flying for pilots with insulin treated diabetes are applauded, particularly the USA for private flying, and Canada for commercial flying. Encouraging developments may be underway in the UK for commercial flying and, if this materializes, could be used as an example for other aviation authorities to help adopt similar protocols. However, new restrictions implemented by the new European Aviation Authority take existing privileges away for National Private Pilot Licence holders with insulin treated diabetes in the UK. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

For each task, participants were provided with a map and instructed to select one of three provided features to help them decide if they were at a certain (incorrect) location. One feature was unique to the correct location; the other two features were consistent with locations in both the incorrect location and the correct location. The unique feature was therefore the 'correct' choice to make. Only orienteers chose the unique feature at a rate significantly higher than chance; all other groups performed either at or worse than expected by chance. Attempts to increase the rate of disconfirming choices were largely ineffective. Findings suggest that when they are lost, both pilots and psychology students, but not orienteers, adopt a confirmatory approach to ascertain their location, which may put pilots who are already lost at even greater risk. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

One particularly interesting example is that manual rotation actions facilitate mental rotations in the same direction. The present study extends this research in two fundamental ways. First, Experiment 1 demonstrates that not only manual rotations facilitate mental rotations but that mental rotations also facilitate subsequent manual rotations. Second, Experiments 2 and 3 targeted the mechanisms underlying this interplay. Here, manual steering wheel rotations produced salient visual effects, namely the rotation of either a plane or a horizon in an aviation display. The rotation direction of these visual effects either did or did not correspond to the direction of the manual rotation itself. These experiments clearly demonstrate an impact of sensory action effects: Mental rotations facilitate manual rotations with visual effects of the same direction (as the mental rotation), irrespective of the direction of the manual rotation. These findings highlight the importance of effect anticipation in action planning. As such they support the contentions of ideomotor theory and shed new light on the cognitive source of the interplay between visual imagery and motor control. © 2012 American Psychological Association."

Despite their past performance, in particular in aviation, accident investigations are criticized for their reactive nature and the lack of learning potential they provide. Although safety management systems are considered a modern method with a more prospective potential, they too are hard to judge by their quantitative performance. Instead of measuring both concepts along the lines of their output, this contribution explores the origin, context and notions behind both approaches. Both approaches prove to be adaptive to new developments and have the ability to shift their focus towards learning and cognition. In assessing their potential, accident investigations prove to cover a specific domain of application in the risk domain of low probability and major consequences, fulfilling a mission as public safety assessor. In order to make optimal use of their analytic and diagnostic potential, investigations should mobilize more complex and sophisticated scientific theories and notions, in particular of a non-linear nature. Consequently, they are neither reactive, nor proactive, but provide a specific approach to safety issues. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

We tested training speed and screen resolution in a project, sponsored by Defence Research and Development Canada, to develop components for prototype air mission simulators.Method: For this study, 54 participants used a single-screen PC-based flight simulation program to learn to chase and catch an F-18A fighter jet with another F-18A while controlling the chase aircraft with a throttle and side-stick controller. Screen resolution was varied between participants, and training speed was varied factorially across two sessions within participants. Pretest and posttest trials were at high resolution and criterion (900 knots) speed.Results: Posttest performance was best with high screen resolution training and when one ARTT training session was followed by a session of criterion speed training.Conclusion: ARTT followed by criterion training improves performance on a visual-motor coordination task. We think that ARTT influences known facilitators of transfer, including similarity to the criterion task and contextual interference.Application: Use high-screen resolution, start with ARTT, and finish with criterion speed training when preparing a mission simulation. © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Methods: A quantitative crosssectional study was conducted on 807 working pilots between October 2009 and October 2010 using a self-administered questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic data and information about workload. CMD prevalence was estimated with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 items (SRQ-20). Multiple logistic regression was used in statistical data analyses. Results: The overall prevalence of CMD was 6.7% with the cutoff point of 8 used in this study, i.e., scores greater than or equal to 8 in SRQ-20 defi ne positive cases. Using alternative cutoffs, the prevalence was 9.2% (cut off point 7) or 12% (cutoff point 6). Among the individuals who did not exercise, 10.2% presented suspected CMD. Among those with a heavy workload, 23.7% presented scores indicating suspected CMD. Only variables relating to workload and the practice of physical activity were signifi cantly correlated with the estimate of CMD after multivariate analysis. Regular physical exercise afforded a possible protective effect against suspected cases of CMD, while there was a higher prevalence of suspected cases among subjects with heavy workloads. Discussion: The inclusion of the topic of mental health among the targets and priorities of civil aviation in Brazil is imperative. Addressing issues such as the regular practice of physical activity and workload can contribute to achieving a better balance between fl ight safety and productivity. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

In addition, the unique occupational and environmental characteristics of flight attendant employment may have consequential occupational health and safety implications, including radiation exposure, cancer, mental ill-health, musculoskeletal injury, reproductive disorders, and symptoms from cabin air contamination. The respective roles of governments and employers in managing these are controversial. A structured literature review was undertaken to identify key themes for promoting a future agenda for flight attendant health and safety. Recommendations include breast cancer health promotion, implementation of Fatigue Risk Management Systems, standardization of data collection on radiation exposure and health outcomes, and more coordinated approaches to occupational health and safety risk management. Research is ongoing into cabin air contamination incidents, cancer, and fatigue as health and safety concerns. Concerns are raised that statutory medical certification for flight attendants will not benefit either flight safety or occupational health. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

On the downside, it introduces perceptual distortions and biases and inability to process symbolic information and alters motor abilities. As emergency human-machine interfaces (HMIs) will be used to bring a system under control, i.e. to avoid or minimise losses, they should be designed to accommodate the human capacities that have been altered by danger-induced emotional arousal. A model called direct perception-action coupling (DPAC) that combines direct perception and embodied cognition, which is not predicated on higher cognitive functions, has been developed to describe the available capacities of an operator under stress. Finally, the conceptual application of human performance theories under stress, through the DPAC model, to design emergency HMIs is discussed with examples. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Although exposure to mild hypoxia does not affect well-learned cognitive and motor performance of aircrew, it has been proposed that it can affect the performance of some complex cognitive performance tasks involving multiple demands typical of emergency tasks that may have to be performed by pilots. In order to simulate some of these complex cognitive demands, 25 student volunteers participated in an experiment which assessed performance of complex logical reasoning and and multiple memory tasks before and after 2 hours of exposure to normoxia and mild hypoxia. Performance for the more difficult components of the complex reasoning task, especially involving conflict decisions, were marginally significantly degraded by mild hypoxia. Since the effects were only marginally significant future studies should investigate the effects of mild hypoxia on more subtle complex decision-making tasks. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

That is, the meaning is not inherent to the relationship between words, signs and symbols that arise from negotiating a necessary and unavoidable. As the concepts of sense as discrete and static representations imply a notion of classical computing and design of a cognitive system corresponding conceptions of meaning construction as located and shared among agents implies notions of different computing and cognition. Several efforts have been developed to meet these demands. Among them are the Connectionism (also known as neural networks. Records on aspects of mental health and stress of flight professionals are present in the official reports of the organs of investigation of aviation accidents worldwide since its inception. Problems related to health physical and mental health of pilots (fatigue, stress, physiological and psychosocial problems) account for 19% of causal factors in aircraft accidents.

All this reflects on our quality of life with special emphasis upon a particular syndrome called Burnout. Aviation is no exception and packed into its processes each day more expeditious, promotes a perfect environment for the development and spread of the syndrome. Aim: To evaluate the quality of life, organizational climate, and the level of physical activity among employees of a Brazilian airline. Methods: A cross-sectional design was conducted with 8 subjects. Results: Total score on the WHOQOL quality of life questionnaire was 64.7 (SD 10.8), and the environmental field showed the lowest score. Nevertheless, the sedentary risk factor was performed in 25% of the sample. About the organizational climate, it can be seen that 6.12% of the sample was framed in ""Professional Exhaustive"", 29.60% in the condition of ""Warning"", and 64.37% in the condition of ""Professional Efficiency"". Conclusion: the study found a low quality of life, especially in the environmental category, sedentary people and a large proportion of employees in this Brazilian airline with negative scores on the Organizational Climate. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Accident investigation reports continue to highlight the relationship between restricted sleep and poor safety outcomes. However, to date we have a limited understanding of how sleep and HEA interact. A total of 302 sectors of normal airline flight operations were observed by trained observers, and instances of heightened emotional activity were recorded. During the cruise phase of each of these sectors, crew members were asked to calculate the amount of sleep they had obtained in previous 24 and 48 h. In the 302 sectors of normal flight operations, 535 instances of HEA were observed. Descriptive analyses of instances of HEA and sleep in the prior 24 and 48 h showed a significant relationship between the occurrence of HEA and recent sleep.

However, the practice of surgery contains far more than high-quality technical skills. These other skills are termed non-technical skills (NTS) and include cognitive and social skills such as decision making, situation awareness, professionalism, teamwork and communication. There is increasing evidence that deficiencies in NTS exist in surgical teams and that this can significantly affect team performance and patient safety. Clearly current models of surgical training do not adequately ensure the development of these skills and healthcare still ‘lags unacceptably behind other safety-critical industries such as aviation’ (House of Commons Health Committee, 2009). These NTS are not innate personality traits but can be taught and developed through training. Several authors and government bodies have called for improved training to address this skills gap and simulation has emerged as a powerful training tool to help achieve this (1, 2). This chapter will first discuss the importance of NTS in healthcare and assuring patient safety and also highlight deficiencies of NTS in surgical practice. Secondly, training methods to improve NTS will be discussed with an emphasis on high-fidelity simulation-based training, which is being increasingly used as a tool to develop and assess these skills in healthcare. © 2014 Prokar Dasgupta, Kamran Ahmed, Peter Jaye and Mohammed Shamim Khan editorial matter and selection."

This study analyzes all incapacitations occurring among UK commercial pilots, in flight and off duty, in 2004 to derive a baseline minimum annual incapacitation rate for the UK commercial pilot population. Method: The study cohort was all professional pilots holding a valid UK/JAR (Joint Aviation Requirements) Class 1 medical certificate and license in 2004. Three data sources were used to identify episodes of incapacitation: the statutory notification of prolonged illness, personal injury, or pregnancy to the UK Civil Aviation Authority; Mandatory Occurrence Reports (MORs) for in-flight medical incidents; and death certificates. The total number of incapacitations was expressed as a proportion of the number of professional pilots to give an incapacitation rate. Results: In 2004 there were 16,145 UK/JAR professional pilot license holders. Of the notified medical events, 36 presented as incapacitations; half were cardiac or cerebrovascular. In-flight incapacitations were predominantly of psychiatric cause. There were four sudden deaths. The type of incapacitation varied with age. A male pilot in his 60s had 5 times the risk of incapacitation of a male pilot in his 40s. The annual incapacitation rate was 40/16,145 = 0.25%. Discussion: Aeromedical emphasis on minimizing cardiovascular risk and monitoring the mental health of pilots remains appropriate. Age should influence the content and periodicity of regulatory aeromedical assessments. The demonstrated annual incapacitation rate of 0.25% may provide a basis for quantifying the acceptable risk for a pilot undertaking single pilot commercial air transport operations. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

This psychology of decision-making has received little formal attention in anaesthesiology literature, although it is widely appreciated in other safety cultures, such as aviation, and other medical specialities. We sought to identify which types of cognitive errors are most important in anaesthesiology. MethodsThis study consisted of two parts. First, we created a cognitive error catalogue specific to anaesthesiology practice using a literature review, modified Delphi method with experts, and a survey of academic faculty. In the second part, we observed for those cognitive errors during resident physician management of simulated anaesthesiology emergencies. ResultsOf >30 described cognitive errors, the modified Delphi method yielded 14 key items experts felt were most important and prevalent in anaesthesiology practice (Table 1). Faculty survey responses narrowed this to a 'top 10' catalogue consisting of anchoring, availability bias, premature closure, feedback bias, framing effect, confirmation bias, omission bias, commission bias, overconfidence, and sunk costs (Table 2). Nine types of cognitive errors were selected for observation during simulated emergency management. Seven of those nine types of cognitive errors occurred in >50 of observed emergencies (Table 3). ConclusionsCognitive errors are thought to contribute significantly to medical mishaps. We identified cognitive errors specific to anaesthesiology practice. Understanding the key types of cognitive errors specific to anaesthesiology is the first step towards training in metacognition and de-biasing strategies, which may improve patient safety. © The Author [2012].

We have demonstrated that the oxidative stress through AT <inf>1</inf> receptor in the brain activates sympathetic nervous system. The aim of the present study was to determine whether experimental jet lag causes sympathoexcitation via oxidative stress through AT <inf>1</inf> receptor in the cardiovascular center of the brainstem (rostral ventrolateral medulla; RVLM) or not. Experimental jet lag was made to normotensive (Wister-Kyoto rat; WKY rat) and hypertensive rats (stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats; SHRSP) by the exposure to a 12 hour phase advance for 5 days. In WKY, jet lag increases blood pressure and the activity of sympathetic nervous system via oxidative stress through angiotensin II type 1 receptor in the RVLM for 2 days only, and the changes are improved at 3 day after the initiation of jet lag. In SHRSP, jet lag also increases blood pressure and the activity of sympathetic nervous system via oxidative stress through angiotensin II type 1 receptor in the RVLM, and the changes are greater compared to those in WKY, and are maintained for the period of jet lag. These results suggest that experimental jet lag causes sympathoexcitation via oxidative stress through AT <inf>1</inf> receptor in the brain, especially in hypertension. © 2011 IEEE."
"Personality and motivational needs in Indian military pilots","2011","International Journal of Applied Aviation Studies","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869130326&partnerID=40&md5=7be49e05eff9aa235486fb5bf06195a3","Research on cultural differences provides a different aspect of the attributes in pilots that might affect job performance. Basic attributes of personality and motivation are of importance for military aviators to maintain optimal personal effectiveness, flying proficiency and safety in aviation. Ninety military pilots were assessed on the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS), and the Revised Neuroticism Extraversion and Openness Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). The results of this study showed that Indian aircrew were lower on achievement, dominance, change and heterosexuality when compared to American aircrew. They were significantly higher on other needs such as affiliation, deference, order, succorance, abasement and nurturance. The results on the NEO-PI-R showed that the group was significantly higher on neuroticism and significantly lower on extraversion and conscientiousness. These cross cultural differences can be attributed to the collectivistic nature of Indian culture as opposed to the individualistic nature of American culture. The findings imply that cultural factors are likely to influence personality and motivation and that this issue needs to be taken into account during aircrew selection, training and clinical evaluation."

The study sample consisted of 118 commercial airline pilots from China Southern Airlines Ltd. The results show risk tolerance displays an indirect effect on safety operation behavior through influencing hazardous attitude; risk perception has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between risk tolerance and safety operation behavior. Based on the above, it can be concluded that the low risk tolerance primarily influences safety operation behavior indirectly through affecting hazardous attitude. With risk perception increasing, the negative effects of risk tolerance on safety operation behavior are gradually reduced.

We conducted 2 experiments in which novices and expert pilots viewed simulated aircraft landing scenes. The scenes were interrupted by the display of a black screen and then started again after a forward or backward shift. The participant's task was to determine whether the moving scene had been shifted forward or backward. A forward misjudgment of the final position of the moving scene was interpreted as a representational momentum (RM) effect. Experiment 1 showed that an RM effect was detected only for experts. The lack of motion anticipation on the part of novices is a surprising result for the RM literature. It could be related to scene unfamiliarity, encoding time, or shift size. Experiment 2 was run with novices only. It was aimed at testing the potential impact of 2 factors on the RM effect: scene encoding time and shift size. As a whole, the results showed that encoding time and shift size are important factors in anticipation processes in realistic dynamic situations. © 2011 American Psychological Association."

Physiological reactions of air traffic controllers during the performance of training scenario were estimated. 39 participants - 14 experienced air traffic controllers and 25 students performed a 40-minute scenario, which included 3 stressful incidents: a rapid increase in air traffic density, low fuel level and plane engine failure. Students also performed the scenario after brief training. The results have shown that as expertise grows respondents show a significant decrease in duration and change in patterns of non-stationary phases of heart rate arising in response to the stressful incidents. These changes of parameters of non-stationary phases are connected with increased efficiency of air traffic controllers' cognitive performance in stressful conditions. The research has illustrated that the analysis of non-stationary phase parameters complements classical HRV measures and may be used for assessment of physiological responses of operators in Augmented Cognition applications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

"Somatic situation awareness: A model for sa acquisition under imminent threat and severe time stress","2011","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79956145682&partnerID=40&md5=2264e5d711c7199e20411e2fc204104a","Classical models of Situation Awareness (SA) describe it as a process involving self-agency, or as rooted in [externally directed] consciousness operating in a perceptual cycle. These models are robust for dynamic situations where events unfold gradually in the temporal dimension at a rate that is compatible with the ability of the human agent to process information, and where this information processing is largely unaffected by event-induced [aversive] emotional arousal. A model for SA acquisition for situations that express rapid dynamics for a limited duration, which are non-prototypical in nature, and involve high stakes, including danger-induced emotional arousal, does not exist. These types of situations are typically encountered in mission critical domains such as law enforcement, firefighting, aviation, combat, etc. In these situations, the traditional models of SA predicated on conscious perception of situation elements and processing of information may not be appropriate, because the [slow] speed and [high] bandwidth of consciousness are suboptimal for the occasion, thus preventing the agent from realizing successful outcomes. Furthermore, unconsciousness, which has largely been ignored by SA theorists, plays a critical role in acquiring SA under these circumstances. This paper presents a model for SA, referred to as Somatic Situation Awareness (SSA), for situations such as those described above. The SSA model shows that the incorporation of two key findings from psychology and neurosciences, unconscious or attention-driven orientation, and somatosensory processes, respectively, can adequately explain situation assessment for these special instances. In terms of the SA acquisition taxonomy, the aforesaid processes have been classified as belonging to the pre-cognitive phase. Next, the paper shows how this pre-cognitive phase of SA acquisition may influence the classical SA framework. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of SSA with regards to human-system design, computer cognition, technology and training. © 2011 IEEE."

A single rehearsal flight entailing a search for a target on the ground increased the minimum altitude in later flights, but this positive effect did not completely generalize when the target on the ground was changed.

However, it is not known whether stress acts by directly influencing the strength of the underlying memories or whether it influences the generation process that plays a critical role in tests such as free recall. To address this issue, we examined the effects of stress produced by skydiving on recognition memory for negative and neutral pictures. Relative to a non-stress control condition, post-encoding stress in males was found to increase recognition memory for neutral pictures. However, stress was not found to improve recognition for emotional pictures, nor was it found to influence recognition memory in female participants. Additional analysis of recognition performance suggested that stress increased familiarity-based recognition rather than recollection. This study indicates that stress can improve familiarity-based recognition, thus showing that stress directly increases the strength of the underlying memories. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

Accelerated technological and organizational changes in numerous professions lead to increase in jobrelated stress. Since these changes are particularly common in military aviation, this study examined the way military aviation crew experiences job-related stress during a regular aviation drill, depending on particular social-demographic factors and personal traits. Methods. The modified Cooper questionnaire was used to examine the stress related factors at work. The questionnaire was adapted for the aviation crew in the army environment. Personal characteristics were examined using the NEO-PI-R personality inventory. The study included 50 examinees (37 pilots and 13 other crew members) employed in the Serbian Army. The studies were performed during routine physical examinations at the Institute for Aviation Medicine during the year 2007. Statistical analysis of the study results contained descriptive analysis, one-way analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Results. It was shown that army aviation crew works under high stress. The highest stress value had the intrinsic factor (AS = 40.94) and role in organisation (AS = 39.92), while the lowest one had the interpersonal relationship factor (AS = 29.98). The results also showed that some social-demographic variables (such as younger examinees, shorter working experience) and neuroticism as a personality trait, were in correlation with job-related stress. Conclusion. Stress evaluation and certain personality characteristics examination can be used for the devalopment of the basic anti-stress programs and measures in order to achieve better psychological selection, adaptation career leadership and organization of military pilots and other crew members."
"Terrorists brought down the plane!-No, actually it was a technical fault: Processing corrections of emotive information","2011","Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79251610346&partnerID=40&md5=6f40ba1115950494e66b3698d7ff3298","It is well known that people often continue to rely on initial misinformation even if this information is later corrected and even if the correction itself is remembered. This article investigated the impact of emotionality of the material on people's ability to discount corrected misinformation. The focus was on moderate levels of emotionality comparable to those elicited by real-world news reports. Emotionality has frequently been shown to have an impact upon reasoning and memory, but the generality of this influence remains unclear. In three experiments, participants read a report of a fictitious plane crash that was initially associated with either an emotionally laden cause (terrorist attack) or an emotionally more neutral cause (bad weather). This initial attribution was followed by a retraction and presentation of an alternative cause (faulty fuel tank). The scenarios demonstrably affected participants' self-reported feelings. However, all three experiments showed that emotionality does not affect the continued influence of misinformation. © 2010 The Experimental Psychology Society."

Increasing prevalence of criminal prosecution is seen as a threat to the health and safety of employees and entire safety-critical systems in many industries, but initiatives to counter or mitigate the trend are local and haphazard. Social causes such as a greater societal risk consciousness and intolerance of failure are examined, as well as organizational consequences for disclosure and incident reporting. Psychological consequences of the criminalization of human error are evaluated in terms of employee ill-health, an area that is under-investigated. The criminalization of professional mistakes seems to be an increasingly prevalent phenomenon at the intersection of safety work, sociology, criminology and legal as well as social justice. This paper reviews possible research directions into the criminalization of professional mistake in aviation and healthcare, in the hope of stimulating debate and eventually legitimating it as a topic of study in its own right. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Automation has already been studied in a number of (sub-) disciplines and application fields: design, human factors, psychology, (software) engineering, aviation, health care, games. One distinguishing feature of the area we are focusing on is that in the field of interactive critical systems properties such as reliability, dependability and fault-tolerance are as important as usability or user experience. The SIG targets at two problem areas: first the engineering of the user interaction with (partly-) autonomous systems: how to design, build and assess autonomous behavior, especially in cases where there is a need to represent on the user interface both autonomous and interactive objects. An example of such integration is the representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (where no direct interaction is possible), together with aircrafts (that have to be instructed by an air traffic controller to avoid the UAV). Second the design and engineering of user interaction in general for autonomous objects/systems (for example a cruise control in a car or an autopilot in an aircraft). The goal of the SIG is to raise interest in the CHI community on these aspects and to identify a community of researchers and practitioners interested in those more and more prominent issues of interfaces for interactive critical systems. The expected audience should be interested in addressing the issues of integration of mainly unconnected research domains to formulate a new joint research agenda."

In this model, the results of training participants were used as basis of intelligent decision-making, through extracting the meta-information which caused training failure, the relevant knowledge chain could be searched out. Then by calculating the entropy value, the meta-information which caused training failure was sorted. Combined with cognitive theory, relevant meta-information was structured secondly so as to constitute new practical training base.

The project resulted in many ideas about the future of air transport. Besides the collection of about 100 ideas for innovative air transport concepts and elements, the need for an innovation process was expressed. Following the positive reaction of the aeronautical community about ""Out of the Box"", the EC has supported a study in 2008 named CREATE [2] to investigate what mechanisms and concepts can be developed to improve and encourage more long term (upstream) research projects in Aeronautics. CREATE also investigated, what actions need to be taken to initiate an ""incubation process"" with all the critical process elements needed to improve and develop the novel or already existing idea or the feasibility concept to such a maturity level, that the normal national and European funding instruments can be used to bring the idea/concept to the next and higher TRL level. This paper will describe a proposal for a process, which is proposed by a group of experts, in order to support chances for more radical innovative ideas and concepts in aeronautics than just the further optimization of a well established classical air transport system. The paper describes such a process where 3 different steps have been identified: First a creative step which may require contributions from several stakeholders and a mixture of participants, experienced personalities as well as young and innovative persons to properly define and shape the innovative idea/concept with the final aim to define an initial project proposal. Second a rigorous assessment procedure, which allows selecting the most promising concepts from a variety of different proposals. The final, and culminating part, is that of incubation. The assessment process has been defined after using the experience of several existing assessment processes, which are applied and installed today whenever basic or innovative research proposals have to be evaluated.

Techniques, such as the Analytical Hierarchical Process may be used as a substitute for this human judgment. Such modelling - if successful - could enable wind farm developers to cut costs, development time and project risk. Management of radar risk and forecasting mitigation costs is important. Radar Impact Assessments normally consist of two parts. A technical assessment that determines the actual effects on the radar using Pager Power's bespoke system Sightlines or other systems. This is followed by an operational assessment which determines the impact on the air traffic service. There are currently few methods for modelling operational impacts of wind turbines. Operational impacts are assessed by experts. Assessments made by different experts are often inconsistent due in part to their subjective nature. Unfortunately automating such assessments is not easy. Assessments are based on a large number of factors and a wealth of experience - meaning that a simple mathematical or flowchart type process might be unsuitable. There are however a number of mathematical techniques for making assessments usually made by human experts. A method which is now widely used is Analytical Hierarchical Process AHP. AHP is a structured technique for dealing with complex decisions based on mathematics and psychology. An AHP decision support system could be produced for quantifying the operational impact of a wind farm on radar."

Fifty-six participants were presented with a risky flight which involved searching for a wayward parachutist with minimal fuel on board their aircraft. A clear distinction in terms of 'risk perception' was evident between those pilots who elected to undertake the risky flight (36 participants) and those pilots who did not (20 participants).

The objective was to examine how the type of automation imperfection (miss vs. false alarm) affects ATSP performance and attention allocation. Background: Research has shown that the type of automation imperfection leads to differential human performance costs. Method: Participating in four 30-min scenarios were 12 full-performance-level ATSPs. Dependent variables included conflict detection and resolution performance, eye movements, and subjective ratings of trust and self confidence. Results: ATSPs detected conflicts faster and more accurately with reliable automation, as compared with manual performance. When the conflict probe automation was unreliable, conflict detection performance declined with both miss (25% conflicts detected) and false alarm automation (50% conflicts detected). Conclusion: When the primary task of conflict detection was automated, even highly reliable yet imperfect automation (miss or false alarm) resulted in serious negative effects on operator performance. Application: The further in advance that conflict probe automation predicts a conflict, the greater the uncertainty of prediction; thus, designers should provide users with feedback on the state of the automation or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of the data underlying the conflict probe algorithm. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

OBJECTIVE.: This preliminary study was undertaken to try and develop an understanding of the factors that may affect recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Clinical recovery from musculoskeletal disabilities is generally achieved after the patient undergoes definitive therapy and rehabilitation. However, a proportion of patients may continue to suffer from morbidity and pain long after clinical and radiological finality has been reached. In these cases, psychosocial factors may have played a contributory role. There has been no research documenting or studying such factors in aviation and pilots in particular. METHODS.: The study was carried out at the Department of Human Engineering from 2004 to 2006. A detailed questionnaire was designed to elicit basic clinical details and psychosocial factors at work and home. RESULTS.: A total of 57 male aircrew participated voluntarily in this study. Of these, 41 (71.9%) achieved normal recovery, whereas in the remaining 16 (28.1%), recovery was considered delayed. The mean age of aircrew in the normal recovery group (33.1 ± 4.6 years) was slightly higher than those in the delayed group (31.0 ± 3.2 years). All the aircrew who had delayed recovery had a spinal disability, whereas spinal disabilities constituted only 46.3% in the normal recovery group. Of the spinal disabilities in aircrew with delayed recovery, 12 had low backache. Aircraft accidents and ejection accounted for almost one-fifth of the total disabilities (n = 11, 21.9%). The respondents identified multiple sources of emotional support viz., friends, family, and parents. CONCLUSION.: A hypothetical model is proposed that possibly explains to some extent the role of psychosocial factors affecting recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities. Further research in psychological and emotional consequences of trauma, in particular ejection and the best means/timings to address these, is recommended. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Mental workload for 18 flight tasks was rated by experienced test pilots (hereinafter called ""expert ratings"") and by study participants' self-report on NASA's Task Load Index (TLX) scale. Pilot performance was rated by a check pilot. The standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN) significantly added 3.7% improvement over the TLX in distinguishing high from moderate-load tasks and 2.3% improvement in distinguishing high from combined moderate and low-load tasks. Minimum RRI in the task significantly discriminated high- from medium- and low-load tasks, but did not add significant predictive variance to the TLX. The low-frequency/high-frequency (LF:HF) RRI ratio based on spectral analysis of R-R intervals, and ventricular relaxation time were each negatively related to pilot performance ratings independently of TLX values, while minimum and average RRI were positively related, showing added contribution of these cardiac measures for predicting performance. Cardiac results were not affected by controlling either for respiration rate or motor activity assessed by accelerometry. The results suggest that cardiac assessment can be a useful addition to self-report measures for determining flight task mental workload and risk for performance decrements.

Background: Cross-training is an established method in which team members are trained with the goal of building shared knowledge. Perturbation training is a new method in which team interactions are constrained to provide new coordination experiences during task acquisition. These two approaches, and a more traditional procedural approach, are compared. Method: Assigned to three training conditions were 26 teams. Teams flew nine simulated uninhabited air vehicle missions; three were critical tests of the teams ability to adapt to novel situations. Team performance, response time to novel events, and shared knowledge were measured. Results: Perturbation-trained teams significantly outperformed teams in the other conditions in two out of three critical test missions. Cross-training resulted in significant increases in shared teamwork knowledge and highest mean performance in one critical test. Procedural training led to the least adaptive teams. Conclusion: Perturbation training allows teams to match coordination variability during training to demands for coordination variability during posttraining performance. Although cross-training has adaptive benefits, it is suggested that process-oriented approaches, such as perturbation training, can lead to more adaptive teams. Application: Perturbation training is amenable to simulation-based training, where perturbations provide interaction experiences that teams can transfer to novel, real-world situations. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Seven pilots (age: 34-60) participated in a one-session test on the Boeing 737-800 simulator. Physiological data were collected while pilots wore an ambulatory multi-channel recording device. Respiratory variables, including inductance plethysmography (respiratory pattern) and pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (P<inf>et</inf>CO<inf>2</inf>), were collected demonstrating change in CO<inf>2</inf> levels proportional to changes in flight task workload. Pilots performed a set of simulation flight tasks. Pilot performance was rated for each task by a test pilot; and self-report of workload was taken using the NASA-TLX scale. Mixed model analysis revealed that respiration rate and minute ventilation are significantly associated with workload levels and evaluator scores controlling for "" vanilla baseline"" condition. Hypocapnia exclusively occurred in tasks where pilots performed more poorly. This study was designed as a preliminary investigation in order to develop a psychophysiological assessment methodology, rather than to offer conclusive findings. The results show that the respiratory system is very reactive to high workload conditions in aviation and suggest that hypocapnia may pose a flight safety risk under some circumstances. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

It suggests that - contrary to popular portrayal - regulators of high technologies face an inevitable epistemic barrier when making technological assessments, which forces them to delegate technical questions to people with more tacit knowledge, and hence to 'regulate' at a distance by evaluating 'trust' rather than 'technology'. It then unravels some of the implications of this and its relation to our theories of regulation and 'regulatory capture'. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2010."

Commercial aviation has a similar task in preventing rare but catastrophic accidents. This article describes the systems in place in commercial aviation that allows that industry to prevent disasters and contrasts this with the situation in mental health. Conclusions: In mental health we should learn from commercial aviation by having: national policies to promote patient safety; a national body responsible for implementing this policy which maintains a database of safety occurrences, sets targets and investigates adverse outcomes; legislation in place which encourages clinicians to report safety occurrences; and a common method and language for investigating safety occurrences. © 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists."
"The advancement of a new human factors report - 'The Unique Report' - facilitating flight crew auditing of performance/operations as part of an airline's safety management system","2010","Ergonomics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-75649096360&partnerID=40&md5=6881efed0710ac18695e3db566ba1d3b","This paper presents the findings of research relating to the specification of a new human factors report, conducted as part of the work requirements for the Human Integration into the Lifecycle of Aviation Systems project, sponsored by the European Commission. Specifically, it describes the proposed concept for a unique report, which will form the basis for all operational and safety reports completed by flight crew. This includes all mandatory and optional reports. Critically, this form is central to the advancement of improved processes and technology tools, supporting airline performance management, safety management, organisational learning and knowledge integration/information-sharing activities. Specifically, this paper describes the background to the development of this reporting form, the logic and contents of this form and how reporting data will be made use of by airline personnel. This includes a description of the proposed intelligent planning process and the associated intelligent flight plan concept, which makes use of airline operational and safety analyses information. Primarily, this new reporting form has been developed in collaboration with a major Spanish airline. In addition, it has involved research with five other airlines. Overall, this has involved extensive field research, collaborative prototyping and evaluation of new reports/flight plan concepts and a number of evaluation activities. Participants have included both operational and management personnel, across different airline flight operations processes. Statement of Relevance: This paper presents the development of a reporting concept outlined through field research and collaborative prototyping within an airline. The resulting reporting function, embedded in the journey log compiled at the end of each flight, aims at enabling employees to audit the operations of the company they work for. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."
"Why CRM? Empirical and Theoretical Bases of Human Factors Training","2010","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860356409&partnerID=40&md5=344737880a976aa94f3ab7f0b2631fd9","One of the most striking developments in aviation safety during the past decade has been the overwhelming endorsement and widespread implementation of training programs aimed at increasing the effectiveness of crew coordination and flightdeck management. Crew Resource Management (CRM) is thus the application of human factors in the aviation system. Training in CRM involves communicating basic knowledge of human factor concepts that relate to aviation and providing the tools necessary to apply these concepts operationally. It represents a new focus on crew-level (as opposed to individual-level) aspects of training and operations. This chapter discusses why an industry would embrace change to an approach that has resulted in the safest means of transportation available and has produced generations of highly competent, well-qualified pilots. It examines both the historic, single-pilot tradition in aviation and the causes of error and accidents in the system. These considerations lead to the conceptual framework, rooted in social psychology, that encompasses group behavior and team performance. The study looks at efforts to improve crew coordination and performance through training. Finally, it discusses what research has revealed about the effectiveness of these efforts and the questions that remain unanswered. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Safety culture as a contemporary healthcare construct: Theoretical review, research assessment, and translation to human resource management","2010","Advances in Health Care Management","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856700575&partnerID=40&md5=cfe6eeebd1c64159ede71daf6da3c281","Through a number of comprehensive reviews, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recommended that healthcare organizations develop safety cultures to align delivery system processes with the workforce requirements to improve patient outcomes. Until health systems can provide safer care environments, patients remain at risk for suboptimal care and adverse outcomes. Health science researchers have begun to explore how safety cultures might act as an essential system feature to improve organizational outcomes. Since safety cultures are established through modification in employee safety perspective and work behavior, human resource (HR) professionals need to contribute to this developing organizational domain. The IOM indicates individual employee behaviors cumulatively provide the primary antecedent for organizational safety and quality outcomes. Yet, many safety culture scholars indicate the concept is neither theoretically defined nor consistently applied and researched as the terms safety culture, safety climate, and safety attitude are interchangeably used to represent the same concept. As such, this paper examines the intersection of organizational culture and healthcare safety by analyzing the theoretical underpinnings of safety culture, exploring the constructs for measurement, and assessing the current state of safety culture research. Safety culture draws from the theoretical perspectives of sociology (represented by normal accident theory), organizational psychology (represented by high reliability theory), and human factors (represented by the aviation framework). By understanding not only the origins but also the empirical safety culture research and the associated intervention initiatives, healthcare professionals can design appropriate HR strategies to address the system characteristics that adversely affect patient outcomes. Increased emphasis on human resource management research is particularly important to the development of safety cultures. This paper contributes to the existing healthcare literature by providing the first comprehensive critical analysis of the theory, research, and practice that comprise contemporary safety culture science."

Safety failings within these organizations have the potential to cause significant public harm. Significant safety improvements in other high risk organizations such as the aviation industry have led to the concept of a high reliability organization (HRO)-a high risk organization that has enjoyed a prolonged safety record. A strong organizational culture is common to all successful HROs, encompassing powerful systems of selection and training. Aircrew selection processes provide a good example of this and are examined in detail in this article using the Royal Air Force process as an example. If the lessons of successful HROs are to be applied to health care organizations, candidate selection to specialties such as surgery must become more objective and robust. Other HROs can provide valuable lessons in how this may be approached. © Société Internationale de Chirurgie 2010."

Applying some of the lessons learned may help make healthcare safer. From the perspective of an anaesthetic background and some thousands of hours of airline flying, I offer a personal perspective, try to give a sense of the place of human factors in airline operations and some of the current problems, and make some suggestions as to what the NHS and anaesthesia might learn from this. Although many of the ingredients for safe operation are frequently already present in our hospitals, and some individual clinical areas and departments achieve high levels of reliability and safety, I will emphasize my firm belief that we cannot expect improvements in human factors training and awareness to be fully effective in the healthcare setting without the parallel development of a simple and strong safety system across organizations. In the process, we may find that the safe hospital turns out somewhat differently to the safe airline. © The Author [2010]."

There is an increasing interest in studying the influence of emotions and its role as psychosocial factors in the work environment as they are able to act as facilitators or shock absorbers. The contrast of the theoretical models by using traditional parametric techniques requires a large sample size to the efficient estimation of the coefficients that quantify the relations between variables. Since the available sample that we have is small, the most common size in European enterprises, we used the maximum entropy principle to explore the emotions that are involved in the psychosocial risks. The analyses show that this method takes advantage of the limited information available and guarantee an optimal estimation, the results of which are coherent with theoretical models and numerous empirical researches about emotions and well-being.

Each of these disciplines places a different emphasis on the notion of what situation awareness is and how it manifests itself. The approach from psychology places situation awareness as something that can only exist in the minds of people in a system. This means that the unit of analysis is the individual and that team situation awareness is the summation of individual situation awareness. The engineering perspective puts situation awareness in the world, represented in the artefacts and objects that people use. This means that the unit of analysis is the things that people interact with. Finally, the systems ergonomics perspective places emphasis on the interaction between people and their artefacts in the world, to propose that situation awareness functions like distributed cognition. This means that the unit of analysis is the whole sociotechnical system. Each of these perspectives is presented and compared with reference to studies in aviation and other domains. It is concluded that the distributed cognition perspective of situation awareness offers the most comprehensive explanation of the phenomena observed in socio-technical systems. Sociotechnical systems theory allows exploration of the social and technical sub-systems independently, which offers a theoretical framework for aligning the three views of situation awareness. © 2010 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Virtual reality (VR) simulation was developed as an alternative to conventional training, such as active assistance and conventional laparoscopic training with artificially perfused organs (Pop-Trainer). VR simulation enables a wide range of repeatable laparoscopic techniques in variable virtual scenarios. For abdominal surgery four different simulation systems (MIST-VR®, LapSim®, Simsurgery®, Lap-Mentor®) are currently available and the modules allow simulation of abstract exercises to more advanced laparoscopic procedures, such as laparoscopic sigmoid resection. The effect of VR training on laparoscopic performance and its impact on non-technical skills was evaluated using the simulator LapSim® after a constructive validity study. Novices benefited most from VR training and performance in the operating room improved significantly after VR training. Good spatial perception and positive stress coping strategies also enhanced laparoscopic performance. VR simulation provides a tool to shift the laparoscopic learning curve outside the operating room and thus contributes to patient safety. It would be worthwhile to include VR training in the surgical curriculum. For economic reasons regional training centers seem to be an effective way to realize a broad implementation of VR simulation in surgical training. Application and development of VR simulators should be professionally promoted just as flight simulators in aviation. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2009."

This research aims to study the impact of civil aviation pilot's personality character and competency on organizational commitment. The result shows that the demographics of civil aviation pilots cause significant distinctions to all these subjects, especially training background. Meanwhile, the personality character, competency and organizational commitment of civil aviation pilots are all positively correlated."

In the 1940s and much of the 1950s, hardly a month went by without at least one blatantly pro-air power article appearing in general interest magazines. Public fascination with flight helped create and sustain exaggerated expectations for air power in the minds of both its official proponents and the American public. Articles in the Saturday Evening Post, Reader's Digest, and Life trumpeted the secure future assured by American air superiority. Military figures like Henry H. ""Hap"" Arnold and Curtis E. LeMay, radio-television personalities such as Arthur Godfrey, cartoon figures like Steve Canyon, and actors like Jimmy Stewart played key roles in the unfolding campaign. Movies like Twelve O'Clock High!, The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, and A Gathering of Eagles projected onto the public imagination vivid images confirming what was coming to be the accepted wisdom: that America's safety against the Soviet threat could best be guaranteed by air power, coupled with nuclear capability. But as the Cold War continued and the specter of the mushroom cloud grew more prominent in American minds, another, more sinister interpretation began to take hold. Call chronicles the shift away from the heroic, patriotic posture of the years just after World War II, toward the threatening, even bizarre imagery of books and movies like Catch-22, On the Beach, and Dr. Strangelove. Call's careful analysis goes beyond the public relations campaigns to probe the intellectual climate that shaped them and gave them power. Selling Air Power adds a critical layer of understanding to studies in military and aviation history, as well as American popular culture. © 2009 Texas A & M University Press. All rights reserved."

Design reviews are significant events in any engineering engagement, necessary to ensure that the design activities achieve the intended goals within the available budget and time. Yet the traditional means to perform a review seem to be limited in their adaptability to the contemporary engineering 'supply chain', in which multiple partners each with their own design responsibility participate. This paper proposes a framework which maintains the core of the traditional design review, but adds elements from the science of psychology to ensure its effectiveness under today's more complex circumstances, thereby bringing costs and rewards back into balance. The recommendations in this paper are supported by four case studies in which the first author participated as the Director of Engineering at Stork Fokker AESP and which is being expanded as part of current research at the Delft University of Technology, focusing on the psychological aspects of the engineering process.

Background: An extensive body of research exists concerning the informational variables that allow successful landing. In contrast, few studies have examined how the attention of pilots can be directed toward these sources of information. Method: In this study, 15 participants were asked to land a virtual Cessna 172 on 245 trials while trying to follow the glide-slope area as accurately as possible. Three groups of participants practiced under different feedback conditions: with self-controlled concurrent feedback (the self-controlled group), with imposed concurrent feedback (the yoked group), or without concurrent feedback (the control group). Results: The self-controlled group outperformed the yoked group, which in turn outperformed the control group. Removing or manipulating specific sources of information during transfer tests had different effects for different individuals. However, removing the cockpit from the visual scene had a detrimental effect on the performance of the majority of the participants. Conclusion: Self-controlled concurrent feedback helps learners to more quickly attune to the informational variables that allow them to control the aircraft during the approach phase. Applications: Knowledge concerning feedback schedules can be used for the design of optimal practice methods for student pilots, and knowledge about the informational variables used by expert performers has implications for the design of cockpits and runways that facilitate the detection of these variables. © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

Background: Risk management is an integral part of piloting. Many factors affect pilots risk management, including individual differences. Therefore, employing a unique methodology from social cognition, the present study examined the influence of attitude, as measured implicitly through the IAT, personality, and flight experience variables on pilots risk-taking behavior. Method: In addition to a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator, 35 pilots completed a battery of psychometric tests. Results: Among the 6 risk perception variables, 10 risk attitude variables, and 2 experience variables, only 2 variables were found to be significantly related with in-flight risk-taking behavior: everyday risk (risk perception) and the IAT effect (attitude). Of these, the IAT effect was the strongest predictor of flight behavior. Conclusion: The results indicate that implicit attitudinal measures, such as the IAT, provide a more accurate forecast of pilot behavior than do the more traditional explicit attitudinal or personality measures. Application: An implicit attitudinal measure can be proactively employed to identify pilots who are potentially more likely to engage in high-risk activities, hence permitting a more strategic approach to pilot training. © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

The FFM was used to determine whether a sample of clinically referred military aviators exhibited commonly occurring personality clusters. Methods: The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was used to evaluate 956 clinically referred U.S. Naval aviators and flight officers on the domains of neuroticism (N), extroversion (E), openness (O), agreeableness (A), and conscientiousness (C). The scores were subjected to model-based cluster analysis and emergent clusters were compared with respect to their scores and clinical outcomes. Results: A two-cluster model provided the best fit to the data. MANOVA indicated significant differences between the two cluster groups with respect to four of the five factors (N, E, A, and C). The greatest differences were for N and E, with the smaller group (Group 1, N 5 291) being significantly more neurotic and less extroverted than Group 2 (N 5 665). Cluster membership had more specificity (0.74) than sensitivity (0.59) for predicting adverse clinical outcome, with the probability of an adverse clinical outcome increasing from 0.14 to 0.28 for those in the neurotic and introverted Group 1. Conclusions: Elevated neuroticism and depressed extraversion were the defining traits of the personality cluster less suited for aviation duty (Group 1). Results support assessment of neuroticism and extroversion during clinical mental health evaluations related to military aviation duty.© by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA."

Because of the increase in computerization, an accurate and efficient monitoring of the automation poses a key challenge to future operators. As the German Aerospace Center's Department of Aviation and Space Psychology is responsible for personnel selection of pilots and air traffic controllers, our objective for the selection of future personnel is to distinguish good monitoring operators from bad operators. In order to identify good monitoring behavior we developed a simulation tool that represents tasks of pilots and controllers within a dynamic air traffic flow. Participants have either to monitor the automatic process or to control the dynamic traffic manually. Monitoring behavior is measured by recording eye movement parameters. The identification of accurate monitoring behavior enables us to adapt selection profiles to future ability requirements. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

Design: Prospective study of checklist use, error selfreporting, and a 10-point safety empowerment survey after participation in a crew resource management training intervention. Setting: Seven hundred twenty-two-bed university hospital; 247-bed affiliated community hospital. Participants: There were 857 participants, the majority of whom were nurses (50%), followed by ancillary personnel (28%) and physicians (22%). Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative checklist use over time; number and type of entries on a Web-based incident reporting system; and measurement of degree of empowerment (1-5 scale) on a 10-point survey of safety attitudes and actions given prior to, immediately after, and a minimum of 2 months after training. Results: Since 2003, 10 courses trained 857 participants in multiple disciplines. Preoperative checklist use rose (75% in 2003, 86% in 2004, 94% in 2005, 98% in 2006, and 100% in 2007). Self-initiated reports increased from 709 per quarter in 2002 to 1481 per quarter in 2008. The percentage of reports related to environment as opposed to actual events increased from 15.9% prior to training to 20.3% subsequently (P<.01). Perceived self-empowerment, creating a culture of safety, rose by an average of 0.5 point in all 10 realms immediately posttraining (mean [SD] rating, 3.0 [0.07] vs 3.5 [0.05]; P<.05). This was maintained after a minimum of 2 months. There was a trend toward a hierarchical effect with participants less comfortable confronting incompetence in a physician (mean [SD] rating, 3.1 [0.8]) than in nurses or technicians (mean [SD] rating, 3.4 [0.7] for both) (P>.05).

But information seeking occupies a central place in the pilots' work. And this activity is undergoing an important development: the transition from paper to electronic documents. A contribution to the assessment of this transition is presented here. The assessment is focused on deterioration of information access, understanding and exploitation, and their possible negative consequences in terms of reliability. The exploitation of the documentation by pilots, and particularly the information seeking activity, are described and linked to their contexts (i.e. the main tasks of flying that require information seeking). Then an users test is presented where some information-seeking tasks are evaluated in terms of cost and errors, by comparing electronic and paper documents. The results show that electronic documents provide new functions that seem useful but also that too many new functions generate difficulties. Then it seems that pilots need some time to learn how to use these new documents. Reducing attention needed to perform a task such as calculation is risky. Some aspects of information seeking by the pilots should be better analysed and evaluated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Born in 1925, most of his life spanned a century burdened with calamitous wars as well as revolutionary developments in science. Aviation played a large role in the century's wars and in the author's outlook on the world. He moved from a literary perspective, after his war experiences, to one governed by science, his earliest bent. During his career, which embodied the early development of both behavioral pharmacology and behavioral toxicology, he emphasized the critical need for precise measures, a point of view illustrated by his adoption of digital computer technology in 1962 as a means to secure such measures. The commentary also describes the author's views of some of the new directions open to neurotoxicology, such as the pursuit of questions about endocrine disruptors, countermeasures for brain aging, and epigenetics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Background: Social psychological phenomena have long been known to influence attitudes and behavior but have not been highlighted in accident investigation models. Method: Using a critical incident method, 28 pilots who flew in Alaska were interviewed. The participants were asked to describe a situation involving weather when they were pilot in command and found their skills challenged. They were asked to describe the incident in detail but were not explicitly asked to identify social pressures. Pressures were extracted from transcripts in a bottom-up manner and then clustered into themes. Results: Of the 28 pilots, 16 described social psychological pressures on their decision making, specifically, informational social influence, the foot-in-the-door persuasion technique, normalization of deviance, and impression management and self-consistency motives. Conclusion: We believe accident and incident investigations can benefit from explicit inclusion of common social psychological pressures. Application: We recommend specific ways of incorporating these pressures into the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System. Copyright © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

In our study we aimed to analyze, by means of the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ) and the Coping Responses Inventory (CRI), the personality profiles, stress-coping strategies and the relationship between them among Slovenian military pilots. The study involved 120 respondents: 30 of whom were military pilots in the experimental group, while the other 90 were in the control groups. The control groups included sport pilots, the general population and soldiers with no involvement in aviation. The members of the control group were selected with regard to the characteristics of the experimental group members, so that both groups were equivalent in terms of relevant factors (e.g. gender, age, health state, level of education etc), thus participating in a study of equivalent pairs. A statistical analysis identified statistically significant differences between the groups in the following BFQ dimensions: energy, conscientiousness and emotional stability; in the dimensions of CRI ‘cognitive avoidance’ (cognitive effort to avoid realistic consideration of a problem); and ‘emotional discharge or emptying’ (behavioural attempts to alleviate tension by venting negative emotions). Results revealed that certain personality characteristics were differentially and significantly related to specific stress coping strategies adopted by military pilots. © Društvo psihologov Slovenije 2009."

This theory is then used as a framework for a model that can fit controller intervention decisions. The performance theory proposes that controllers apply safety margins to ensure separation between aircraft. These safety margins are formed through experience and reflect the biasing of decisions to favor safety over accuracy, as well as expectations regarding uncertainty in aircraft trajectory. In 2 experiments, controllers indicated whether they would intervene to ensure separation between pairs of aircraft. The model closely predicted the probability of controller intervention across the geometry of problems and as a function of controller experience. When controller safety margins were manipulated via task instructions, the parameters of the model changed in the predicted direction. The strength of the model over existing and alternative models is that it better captures the uncertainty and decision biases involved in the process of conflict detection. © 2009 American Psychological Association."

However, some studies have demonstrated age-related sparing on tasks where individuals have substantial experience, often attained over many decades. Here, the authors examined whether decades of experience in a fast-paced demanding profession, air traffic control (ATC), would enable older controllers to perform at high levels of proficiency. The authors also investigated whether older controllers would show diminished age-related decrements on domain-relevant cognitive abilities. Both young and old controllers and noncontrollers performed a battery of cognitive and ATC tasks. Results indicate that although high levels of experience can reduce the magnitude of age-related decline on the component processes that underlie complex task performance, this sparing is limited in scope. More important, however, the authors observed experience-based sparing on simulated ATC tasks, with the sparing being most evident on the more complex air traffic control tasks. These results suggest that given substantial experience, older adults may be quite capable of performing at high levels of proficiency on fast-paced demanding real-world tasks.

Participants were presented with aviation scenarios and asked to recall the scenarios alone or in collaboration with a fellow participant of the same expertise level. Performance in the collaborative condition was compared to nominal group conditions (i.e., pooled individual performance). Results suggest that expertise differentially impacts collaborative memory performance. Non-experts (non-pilots and novices) were relatively disrupted by collaboration, while experts showed a benefit of collaboration. Verbal protocol analyses identified mechanisms related to collaborative skill and domain knowledge that may underlie experts' collaborative success. Specifically, experts were more likely than non-experts to explicitly acknowledge partner contributions by repeating back previously made statements, as well as to further elaborate on concepts in those contributions. The findings are interpreted according to the retrieval strategy disruption theory of collaborative memory and theories of grounding in communication."

Signal modality (visual, auditory) and task demand (low, high) were also manipulated. Warning effectiveness was indexed by accuracy and reaction time (RT) recorded during training and dual task test phases. Thirty-six participants were trained to recognize 4 natural and 4 symbolic indicators, either visual or auditory, paired with critical incidents from an aviation context. As hypothesized, accuracy was greater and RT was faster in response to natural indicators during the training phase. This pattern of responding was upheld in test phase conditions with respect to accuracy but observed in RT only in test phase conditions involving high demand and the auditory modality. Using the experiment as a specific example, we argue for the importance of considering the cognitive contribution of the user (viz., prior learned associations) in the warning design process. Drawing on semiotics and cognitive psychology, we highlight the indexical nature of so-called auditory icons or natural indicators and argue that the cogniser is an indispensable element in the tripartite nature of signification."

Retention of skills and knowledge after neonatal resuscitation courses (NRP) is known to be problematic. The use of cognitive aids is mandatory in industries such as aviation, to avoid dependence on memory when decision-making in critical situations. We aimed to prospectively investigate the effect of a cognitive aid on the performance of simulated neonatal resuscitation. Methods. Thirty-two anaesthesia residents were recruited. The intervention group had a poster detailing the NRP algorithm and the control group did not. Video recordings of each of the performances were analysed using a previously validated checklist by a peer, an expert anaesthetist, and an expert neonatologist. Results. The median (IQR) checklist score in the control group [18.2 (15.0-20.5)] was not significantly different from that in the intervention group [20.3 (18.3-21.3)] (P=0.08). When evaluated by the neonatologist, none of the subjects correctly performed all life-saving interventions necessary to pass the checklist. A minority of the intervention group used the cognitive aid frequently. Conclusions. Retention of skills after NRP training is poor. The infrequent use of the cognitive aid may be the reason that it did not improve performance. Further research is required to investigate whether cognitive aids can be useful if their use is incorporated into the NRP training."

Two consecutive studies were conducted to construct a biocybernetic adaptive system for a professional flight simulator, based on autonomic measures. Workload was varied through different stages of turbulences. In a first study with 18 participants, electrodermal responses of experimental subjects oscillated very close to the individual set point, demonstrating that workload level was adjusted as a result of adaptive control, which was not the case in yoked control subjects without adaptive automation. Combining electrodermal responses with heart rate variability in a second study with 48 participants further enhanced the adaptive power which was seen in even smaller set point deviations for the experimental compared to the yoked control group. We conclude that the level of arousal can be adjusted to avoid hypovigilance by combining autonomic measures in a closed loop. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Thepresent study aimed atevaluating theperception oflight stimulus via the Critical Flicker Fusion threshold (CFF) measurements among aviation pilots. Materials and Methods: Thestudy was carried out under hypoxic conditions corresponding to 5000m altitude, for aperiod of 30min, without theuse ofsupplemental oxygen. Fourteen volunteer pilots, 23-30 years ofage, were examined in thehypobaric chamber (HC). Themeasurements were performed atnormobaria and attheinitial and final phase of hypoxia. Heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SaO<inf>2</inf>) were monitored. Results: The high altitude hypoxia was found to produce adecrease in the CFF threshold F(3.39) = 3.207, p< 0.05, and SaO<inf>2</inf> F(3.39) = 52.651, p< 0.001, as well as HR increase F(3.39) = 7.356, p< 0.001.

Likewise, thehigher theincrease in HR, thehigher thedecrease in CFF r= -0.491 p< 0.05. Conclusions: Under hypoxic conditions, theperceptual ability of thepilots is gradually decreasing. This has been confirmed by the findings of thephysiological examinations. Theauthors express anopinion that it would be advisable to introduce CFF measurement into thehypobaric chamber tests as it allows individual assessment ofthepilot's perceptual ability under conditions ofincomplete physiological compensation ofthehigh altitude hypoxia."

Among these are perceptions of risk, attributions of skill vs. luck, self-discipline, and information seeking in hazardous situations. Over the past two decades, researchers have examined the relationship of LOC to hazardous attitudes, involvement in hazardous events, and other variables related to aviation safety. Research has found aviators to be significantly more internal in LOC than the general population, internality being associated with self-attributions of competency and self-confidence. This research has been cross-sectional and has typically employed small samples of civil aviators. Questions have been raised about psychometric properties of earlier (ipsative) versions of the hazardous attitude scales, and the resulting dependency between the five attitudinal categories. This review examines extant LOC research in aviation psychology, most of which addresses LOC in the context of hazardous attitudes. It examines concepts from attribution theory, (e.g., optimism bias; illusion of unique invulnerability), and argues that these are consistent with the processes underlying the maintenance of LOC and hazardous attitudes. It is recommended that integration of LOC and attribution theory should provide an enhanced explanation of the motivational bases for risk taking and decision making among aviators. © 2008, FAA Academy."

In-flight decision making error is a long time recognized major avenue leading to incidents and accidents. Through the past three decades, tremendous and costly efforts have been developed to attempt to clarify causation, roles and responsibility as well as to elaborate various preventative and curative countermeasures blending state of the art biomedical, technological advances and psychophysiological training strategies. In-flight related statistics have not been shown significantly changed and a significant number of issues remain not yet resolved. Fine Postural System and its corollary, Postural Deficiency Syndrome (PDS), both defined in the 1980's, are respectively neurophysiological and medical diagnostic models that reflect central neural sensory-motor and cognitive controls regulatory status. They are successfully used in complex neurotraumatology and related rehabilitation for over two decades. Analysis of clinical data taken over a ten-year period from acute and chronic post-traumatic PDS patients shows a strong correlation between symptoms commonly exhibited before, along side, or even after error, and sensory-motor or PDS related symptoms. Examples are given on how PDS related central sensory-motor control dysfunction can be correctly identified and monitored via a neurophysiological ocular-vestibular-postural monitoring system. The data presented provides strong evidence that a specific biomedical assessment methodology can lead to a better understanding of in-flight adaptive neurophysiological, cognitive and perceptual dysfunctional status that could induce in flight-errors. How relevant human factors can be identified and leveraged to maintain optimal performance will be addressed."

Background: Relevance is a pervasive term used in several domains, such as pragmatics, information science, and psychology. Quantifying the relevance of information can be helpful in effective display design. Displays should be designed so that the more relevant information is more easily accessed. Method: This procedure focuses on computing the relevance of a piece of information by taking into account three aspects of tasks that use the information: the number of different tasks that make use of the information, the frequency of occurrence of those tasks, and the criticality of those tasks. The methodology can be used to compute the aggregate relevance of a piece of information for a particular component of a system or for the entire system. This methodology was illustrated using the domain of air traffic control (ATC). Results: In support of the validity of the methodology, we were able to confirm the value of weather information and traffic information in ATC towers. Conclusion: The method can be used to derive information relevance, a characteristic of information that has implications for display design for any domain. Application: Designers can use information about aggregate relevance to design information displays that feature the most relevant information.

The herein presented methodology and measurement equipment were developed and tested in numerous terrestrial and space experiments using a simulation of a spacecraft docking on a space station. However, in this study the method was applied to a comparable terrestrial task-the flight simulator test (FST) used in the DLR selection procedure for ab initio pilot applicants for passenger airlines. This provided a large amount of data for a statistical verification of the space methodology. For the evaluation of the strain level of applicants during the FST psychophysiological measurements were used to construct a ""psychophysiological arousal vector"" (PAV) which is sensitive to various individual reaction patterns of the autonomic nervous system to mental load. Its changes and increases will be interpreted as ""strain"". In the first evaluation study, 614 subjects were analyzed. The subjects first underwent a calibration procedure for the assessment of their autonomic outlet type (AOT) and on the following day they performed the FST, which included three tasks and was evaluated by instructors applying well-established and standardized rating scales. This new method will possibly promote a wide range of other future applications in aviation and space psychology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Cognitive function following exposure to contaminated air on commercial aircraft: A case series of 27 pilots seen for clinical purposes","2008","Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-51049112949&partnerID=40&md5=23e8aeeae83e649bd35045c858ac6bc5","Background. Cabin air on commercial aircraft is sometimes contaminated with hydraulic fluids, synthetic jet engine oils and combusted or pyrolized materials. The incidence of contaminated air events is hard to quantify as commercial aircraft do not have air quality monitoring systems on board. In the UK, around 350 aircrew have advised their union that they may be suffering physical and psychological ill health following exposure to contaminated air. Design. This paper presents a case series of 27 pilots referred for psychological assessment. The general aim of the assessment was to determine whether pilots show evidence of cognitive impairment and whether this relates to exposure history. Materials and method. All pilots underwent neuropsychological and adult mental health assessment, undertaken by 12 examiners, instructed to search for alternative explanations other than exposure to toxic fumes for any symptoms reported. Results. Pilots reported alarming cognitive failures at work such as being unable to retain or confusing numerical information from Air Traffic Control. Nine pilots were excluded from further analysis because they had a medical or psychiatric condition which might otherwise explain these difficulties. In the remaining 18 pilots, language, perceptual skills and general intellectual ability were preserved, but performance on tests of psychomotor speed, attention and executive functioning was below expected levels. Conclusions. The cognitive deficits identified in this cohort of pilots cannot be attributed to factors such as mood disorder or malingering. However, the evidence available in this study does not enable firm conclusions to be drawn regarding a causal link with contaminated air; the cohort of pilots was self-selected and only crude indices of exposure were available. Further research is warranted given the scientific uncertainty regarding the health effects of inhalation of heated or pyrolized engine oil. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd."

Methods: The evaluation of environmental noise level, questionnaire survey, and health examination were performed for 917 residents. The study population consisted of four groups: subjects who lived in the village close to the fighter airbase (high exposure), subjects who lived along the course of fighters (intermediate exposure), and subjects near a helicopter airbase, and the control group. Results: The prevalence of the aircraft noise related accident and irritable bowel syndrome in the exposure groups were higher than that of the control group. The risks of noise induced hearing loss, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were higher in the exposed groups than in the control group. The prevalence of anxiety disorder and primary insomnia were higher in the exposed groups than in the control group. Prevalence odd ratios of the risk for primary insomnia after adjusting age, sex, agricultural noise, and occupation were 4.03 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.56-10.47] for the subject near the helicopter airbase, 1.23 (95% CI 0.40-3.76) for those intermediately exposed to fighter noise, and 4.99 (95% CI 2.14-11.64) for those highly exposed to fighter noise. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that the aircraft noise may have adverse effects on hearing function, cardiovascular health and mental health. Therefore, it seems to be needed to take proper measures including the control of the aircraft noise and the management of the exposed people' s health."

The aim of this study was to derive norms for people suffering from fear of flying completing the FAS and FAM. Methods: The sample is composed of 2072 individuals suffering from fear of flying and 1012 non-patients. Means, standard deviations and percentile ranks for raw FAS and FAM subscale scores will be presented. Normative data are provided enabling the comparison of individual scores. Results: The results showed a conspicuous difference between the patient and non-patient samples. As a whole the patient group scored higher on the scale assessing the level of anxiety experienced in different flight or flight-related situations and on the scale measuring the symptoms of anxiety or anticipatory anxiety in flight situations than the normal controls. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the FAS and FAM questionnaires can be applied in the investigation of fearful flyers and the normal population. A considerable number of flying phobics obtained scores in the clinically significant range on the subscales assessing anticipatory anxiety, in-flight anxiety, generalized flight anxiety, somatic complaints and cognitive complaints. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In two experiments, participants made rapid judgements about the number of items present in a visual display. Within each display, items were grouped into a canonical representation (e.g., triangle, square, and pentagon) or were arranged linearly. In both experiments, grouping information facilitated enumeration performance, replicating previous findings in the literature. In Experiment 2, the facilitative effect of grouping information was found to be greater for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) than for matched novices, though they were no better than novices on linear arrays. This may be because linear, like canonical arrays, hold unique numerosity information, but only when they contain the minimum number of points necessary to define a line (i.e., 2). So ATCs' performance on linear arrays containing more than two items does not benefit from a facilitative effect of grouping information. That their experience of being ATCs, in terms of years served, was shown to account for the expertise effect suggests that such visuospatial expertise is acquired through frequent exposure to spatial arrays. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

(1987). Between hope and fear: The psychology of risk. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 20, 255-295] tolerance of risk may be governed by sensitivity to either the opportunities for gain or threats of loss involved. Methods: In the initial study, qualified pilots were presented with 36 written flight scenarios that varied in the levels of opportunity and threat present. The pilots rated the likelihood that they would undertake each flight. Pilots were largely risk averse, as their ratings were all significantly influenced by threat. Results: The pilots whose ratings were significantly influenced by opportunity had been involved in more hazardous aviation incidents than the other pilots. In the final study, 32 qualified pilots completed both the risk tolerance measure and a simulated flight into adverse weather. The pilots who continued flying into adverse weather were less risk averse compared to the pilots who diverted. This further highlighted the link between risk tolerance and risk-taking, and suggested that some pilots may fly into adverse weather because of a greater tolerance of risk. Impact on Industry:The studies provide evidence that a measure of risk tolerance can predict potential accident involvement amongst general aviation pilots. © 2008 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd."

Background: Veridical displays represent realistic scenes. State space displays represent nonveridical n-dimensional information based on informative coordinate axes plus variable features such as color and shading. Empirical investigation of state space displays is relatively new to human factors research. Method: Twelve licensed general aviation pilots flew flight scenarios, trying to deviate as little as possible from a preassigned course while still maintaining standard en route separation from traffic. Flight performance using only a veridical cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) was compared with performance using the CDTI augmented by a 4-D nonveridical state space collision avoidance system (CDTI+4CAS). Results: Using moderate traffic density and complex traffic geometry, the CDTI+4CAS condition showed performance superiority over the baseline CDTI-only condition for five of five dependent measures of maneuver efficiency, four of four measures of maneuver safety, and six of nine measures of user workload. Conclusion: Results suggest that nonveridical information display may enhance operator performance on a control task involving simultaneous processing of multidimensional information. Application: Nonveridical information displays have potential application wherever human control of multidimensional processes is involved. Copyright © 2008, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society."

A knowledge representation is used in which pre- and postconditions are attached to actions. This model captures improved performance due to learning not only in terms of shorter solution times and lower error rates during the task but also in an increased flexibility to solve similar problems and robustness against unexpected events. In 3 experiments using a complex aviation task, the authors contrasted instructions that explicitly stated pre- and postconditions with conventional instructions that did not. The instructions with pre- and postconditions led to better and more robust performance than other instructions, especially on problems that required transfer. The parameters of the model were estimated to obtain a quantitative fit of the results of Experiment 1, which was then successfully used to predict the results of Experiments 2 and 3. © 2008 American Psychological Association."
"Risk Management by Early Recognition of Warning Signs in Patients in Forensic Psychiatric Care","2008","Archives of Psychiatric Nursing","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-47149093014&partnerID=40&md5=7b1a760bae7141dfafe394e17b0a5b2b","Purpose: To clarify the concept of early recognition for the field of forensic nursing. The concept is based on the proposition that patient behavior deteriorating toward aggression is idiosyncratic but nevertheless reconstructable like a ""signature."" Once reconstructed, this signature can be used to detect ""early signs"" of deterioration and thus prevent violent behavior. Concept: Early recognition is approached from the perspective of deteriorating behavior. Special attention is paid to the social and interpersonal factors related to the individual behaving violently. From this perspective, the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of the patient can indicate the onset of aggression, and early recognition of these warning signs can help thwart such deterioration. The aviation metaphor of a ""black box"" is used to emphasize the importance of attention to early warning signs. Patients in forensic care must draw upon their previous experiences (i.e., their own black boxes) to gain insight into their violent behavior and the warning signals for this. The emphasis is on the cooperation between the patient and the nurse in the application of risk management strategies. The Early Recognition Method provides an approach in which patients and nurses also gradually attune their perspectives on aggressive behavior. Conclusion: The concept of early recognition is important because it extends the idea of early intervention to include enabling patients to control their own behavior. Early recognition has strong practical implications for forensic nurses as it allows them to attenuate aggression by assisting patients with the detection of early warning signs. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Older and younger expert and novice pilots read at their own pace scenarios describing simpler or more complex flight situations. Then in a standard interview they discussed the scenario problem and how they would respond. Protocols were coded for identification of problem and solutions to this problem, and frequency of elaborations on problem and solution. Scenario comprehension was measured as differential reading time allocation to problem-critical information and scenario memory by the accuracy of answering questions about the scenarios after the interview. All groups accurately identified the problems, but experts elaborated problem descriptions more than novices did. Experts also spent more time reading critical information in the complex scenarios, which may reflect time needed to develop elaborate situation models of the problems. Expertise comprehension benefits were similar for older and younger pilots. Older experts were especially likely to elaborate the problem compared to younger experts, while older novices were less likely to elaborate the problem and to identify appropriate solutions compared to their younger counterparts. The findings suggest age invariance in knowledge-based comprehension relevant to pilot decision making. © 2008 Psychology Press."

At low temperatures, tunneling time increases with increasing carrier density. At high temperatures, no dependence of tunneling time on carrier density was shown. This unique behavior is well explained by the thermodynamic effect between excitons and free carriers as a function of carrier density on the tunneling process. At low temperatures, a larger fraction of excitons at a higher carrier density, which have a relatively slow tunneling time in contrast to free electrons, leads to a slow tunneling time. The independence of the tunneling time at high temperatures is attributed to the insensitivity of the exciton population to the increased carrier density. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA."

Method: Three measurements were performed: during the medical examination, 6 weeks later during consultation with the physician and 12 weeks after the first examination. Rescue workers (n=1736) and residents (n=339) involved in the disaster participated. Standardized questionnaires on health complaints and concerns were administered. Results: Both groups reported increased health anxiety and somatic sensitivity after 12 weeks. Residents reported more posttraumatic stress symptoms, whereas rescue workers seemed to have gained a better quality of life and were somewhat reassured. Participants who attended the consultation with the physician showed increased reassurance scores after 6 weeks, but their worries had increased again on follow-up. However, nonattendees reported more health anxiety on follow-up. More participants judged participation to have had a positive impact, instead of a negative impact, on their health.

"Who is too old for shift work?

For older night workers, the International Labour Organization has recommended options for transferring to day work or early retirement, but few States have adopted these measures. For commercial air transport pilots, the International Civil Aviation Organization has implemented a series of regulatory measures that could manage the risks associated with aging, including a mandatory retirement age, regular medical assessments for fitness to fly, and limits on the duration of duty and rest. Each of these approaches has strengths and weaknesses. The mandatory retirement age is effectively arbitrary, has been controversial, and was recently increased from 60 to 65 yrs for one member of a two-person cockpit crew. Medical assessments offer a more individualized approach, but to improve safety, they must address aspects of health and physical or mental function that affect work performance and safety outcomes. The traditional focus has been on cardiovascular risk factors, although cardiac incapacitation is not a cause of accidents in a two-person cockpit aircraft. On the other hand, while pilot fatigue is an acknowledged cause of accidents, there is currently no requirement to consider issues associated with fatigue or sleep problems in fitness-to-fly medical assessments. Older long-haul pilots show greater sleep fragmentation than their younger colleagues and those in the general population. Sleep becomes more fragmented with increasing age, but the functional significance of this remains unclear. Among younger adults, experimental sleep fragmentation leads to increased sleepiness and degradation of performance and mood. Greater sleep loss is reported by older long-haul pilots, as well as other older shift workers, compared to younger people working similar duty patterns. Experimental sleep restriction causes a degradation of performance and mood that is cumulative and dose-dependent. In addition, a recent large-scale flight simulation study indicates that the duration of sleep obtained by individual pilots is an independent predictor of crew performance in a two-person cockpit. Based on these considerations, we propose that fatigue and sleep-related issues should become a standard part of fitness-for-work medical assessments, particularly for older shift workers. A multi-layered approach is proposed, with a routine structured sleep history leading to referral to specialist sleep services where appropriate. Criteria for specialist referral and medical retirement should be related to the workplace risk represented by an older worker. Additional research is needed to develop and validate sleep-related criteria for assessing fitness for work. For example, a better understanding of the effects of sleep fragmentation on the waking function of older workers might lead to a fragmentation threshold for fitness for work. The potential negative effects of unemployment and early retirement also need to be taken into account when considering the options for managing the occupational health and safety needs of older shift workers.

It soon became apparent that the way to protect the occupant of an aircraft from the effects of ascent to altitude was to enclose either the individual, or the cabin, in a sealed or pressurized environment. Of primary concern in commercial airline transport operations is the selection of a suitable cabin pressurization schedule that assures adequate oxygen partial pressures for all intended occupants. For the past several decades, 8000 ft has been accepted as the maximum operational cabin pressure altitude in the airline industry. More recent research findings on the physiological and psycho-physiological effects of mild hypoxia have provided cause for renewed discussion of the "" acceptability"" of a maximum cabin cruise altitude of 8000 ft; however, we did not find sufficient scientific data to recommend a change in the cabin altitude of transport category aircraft.

The control condition was sitting in silence, while the experimental condition was preferred music listening. Dependent variables included heart rate, mean arterial pressure, state anxiety, and perceived air traffic activity. Results indicated that in both the control and experimental conditions state anxiety levels significantly decreased over time (p < .05), with no difference in decrease between the conditions. There were no significant differences in physiological measures found between or within groups. However, a significant interaction effect revealed that the group with High-Trait Anxiety and Introversion experienced no decrease in state anxiety over time.

"Determinants of conflict detection: A model of risk judgments in air traffic control","2008","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-40449115093&partnerID=40&md5=b6dd7b09d44f01d009f95627f67faea2","Objective: A model of conflict judgments in air traffic control (ATC) is proposed. Background: Three horizontal distances determine risk judgments about conflict between two aircraft: (a) Dt<inf>0</inf> is the distance between the crossing of the aircraft trajectories and the first aircraft to reach that point; (b) Dt<inf>h</inf> is the distance between the two aircraft when they are horizontally closest; and (c) Dt<inf>v</inf> is the horizontal distance between the two aircraft when their growing vertical distance reaches 1,000 feet. Methods: Two experiments tested whether the variables in the model reflect what controllers do. In Experiment 1, 125 certified controllers provided risk judgments about situations in which the model variables were manipulated. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between the model and expertise by comparing a population of certified controllers with a population of ATC students. Results: Across both experiments, the model accounted for 44% to 50% of the variance in risk judgments by certified controllers (N = 161) but only 20% in judgments by ATC students (N = 88). There were major individual differences in the predictive power of the model as well as in the contributions of the three variables. In Experiment 2, the model described experts better than novices. Conclusion: The model provided a satisfying account of the data, albeit with substantial individual differences. It is argued that an individual-differences approach is required when investigating the strategies involved in conflict judgment in ATC. Application: These findings should have implications for developing user-friendly interfaces with conflict detection devices and for devising ATC training programs.

The new law, says that pilots can fly until age 65 and there are no restrictions on domestic operations, on international flights, because of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), rules at least one person on flight deck still must be under 60. The change took place and the age 60 rule ended because of shifts in priorities, power, and personalities in the nation's capital. The retirement age provision is originally included in a larger bill to reauthorize FAA programs. The delay with STS-122 meant a corresponding delay in hauling ESA's Columbus laboratory to the ISS and even Columbus is an issue of prestige to some in Europe."

At the time of the interdepartmental meeting prior to the law of June 1941, it is the only department to ask for and obtain a more restrictive revision of the text. Very minute inquests enable the department to check that no civil servant or military man managed to escape the law. There are various reasons to this attitude : this department which is very anxious about its efficiency, is essential for the government, and cares to gain the favour of the German services on which the civilian as well as the military aviation district depend; it can also be pointed out that this district endeavours to dismiss the politics of nationalization of the Popular Front to which personalities of Jewish origin were associated. This article presents results backed up by figures of these politics of exclusion in the Air Force Office, and moves on to the very specific problem of the aviation industries among which the exclusion of Jews was enforced in a discretionary way."

Caffeine is one method employed by pilots on the flight deck to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with fatigue. The present study sought to investigate the effects of caffeine on pilot performance during a demanding task. Employing a repeated measures design, forty-two pilots were randomly divided into three groups (Omg/kg, 3mg/kg and 5mg/kg of caffeine) and completed a base-line task followed by a test task, thirty minutes post caffeine consumption. Both experimental tasks involved pilots completing games on Space Fortress - a computer-based research tool developed at the University of Illinois - Cognitive Psychophysiology Laboratory for the study of complex skills. The results failed to reveal any difference in pilots' performance from the consumption of caffeine. The results are discussed from both an applied and experimental perspective."

Objective: To dynamically monitor the changes in mean cerebral blood flow velocity in different brain regions of high performance fighter pilots during mental arithmetic tasks and consecutive performance tasks. Design, time and setting: The present neurophysiological trial, based on controlled observation, was performed at the Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Institute of Aviation Medicine, Air Force of China between January 2003 and December 2005. Participants: Forty-five males, high performance fighter pilots, averaging (27.6 ± 2.5) years, were recruited for this study. Methods: The mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery of subjects was dynamically tested using transcranial Doppler during 5- hour mental arithmetic tasks and during 5- hour consecutive performance tasks. The neurobehavioral ability index was analyzed throughout each trial according to the number of correct responses, false responses, and lost responses. Simultaneously, cerebral cognitive fatigue-induced lethargy was assessed by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Main outcome measures: Changes in mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery; neurobehavioral ability index of mental arithmetic and consecutive performance tasks; Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores. Results: During mental arithmetic tasks, the mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery increased during hour 2 and decreased after hour 4. There was no significant change in mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery. During hour 4, cerebral cognitive fatigue was observed and, simultaneously, Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores demonstrated the presence of fatigue. During such a stage, the neurobehavioral ability index decreased, indicating a decline in performance ability. During consecutive performance tasks, the mean cerebral blood flow velocity declined earlier in the posterior cerebral artery compared to the middle cerebral artery. Conclusion: Five- hour mental arithmetic tasks have few effects on cerebral functions and do not lead to a significant change in mean cerebral blood flow velocity. Five-hour consecutive performance tasks can induce cerebral cognitive fatigue, and a marked decline in mean cerebral blood flow velocity."

Our study aimed at estimating the role of temperamental traits as components of pilots’ personality in eye-hand co-ordination. The assumption was that differences in the escalation of the level of temperamental traits, as measured with the Formal Characteristic of Behaviour— Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI), will significantly influence eye-hand co-ordination. At the level of general scores, enhanced briskness proved to be the most important trait for eye-hand co-ordination. An analysis of partial scores additionally underlined the importance of sensory sensitivity, endurance and activity. The application of eye-hand co-ordination tasks, which involve energetic and temporal dimensions of performance, helped to disclose the role of biologically-based personality traits in psychomotor performance. The implication of these findings for selecting pilots is discussed. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Alexithymia significantly moderated the pre- to postjump fluctuation of state anxiety such that only alexithymic skydivers' anxiety diminished as a consequence of performing a skydive. This suggests that skydiving is an effective means of emotion regulation for alexithymic women. However, the significant rise in anxiety shortly after landing suggests that any emotional benefits are short-lived. No anxiety fluctuations emerged for nonalexithymic skydivers. The Alexithymia x Time interaction remained significant when controlling for age, experience, and trait anxiety.

Recent attention has focused on standardizing the content of pathology reports, particularly for common malignancies, to facilitate transmission of required information. Comparatively little attention has been focused on the format of reports - the arrangement of headlines, text blocks, and other report elements to optimize communication. Objective. - To provide guidance to report designers and authors about how to format reports to maximize the speed, fidelity, and ease of information transfer. Data Sources. - Review of relevant literature from commercial publishing and aviation and the fields of cognitive psychology and pathology, supplemented with an analysis of 10 000 pathology reports and the author's personal experience as a practicing pathologist. Conclusions. - Four evidence-based and time-tested principles can help pathologists format information to communicate more effectively: (1) use of diagnostic headlines to emphasize key points, (2) maintenance of layout continuity with other reports and over time, (3) optimization of information density for readers, and (4) reduction of extraneous information or ""clutter."" Practical advice is also provided to help pathologists minimize corruption of formatting as reports are transmitted electronically between medical information systems."

Items representing each of the themes were prepared and administered to 940 Australian commercial pilots. Results: Data from half of the sample (N = 468) were used in an exploratory factor analysis that produced a 3-factor model of Management commitment and communication, Safety training and equipment, and Maintenance. A confirmatory factor analysis on the remaining half of the sample showed the 3-factor model to be an adequate fit to the data. Discussion: The results of this study have produced a scale of safety climate for aviation that is both reliable and valid.

Such elements may be other drivers, the condition of the street or traffic signs. For each of these elements drivers do not just have to perceive them but they must understand them according to their relevance to their goals. In addition, drivers must also make assumptions about the future actions or states of these elements. For example, perceiving a car coming from the right when entering a crossroads is far from being enough in order to react accordingly. The driver must interpret this car according to its relevance to his own goal, that is, safely passing the crossroads. He has to take into account whether he or the car from the right has to give way. But even this is not enough to select the appropriate action. If the other car has to give way, the driver will try to assess from the speed of the car whether the other car will indeed stop. A concept that has recently become rather popular in aviation psychology and that aims at describing and integrating these different cognitive processes is called situation awareness. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London."

The questionnaire included the 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Weinstein's noise sensitivity questionnaire, and questions regarding disturbances of daily life due to aircraft noise exposure. As a result of the survey, 179 responses were collected from a residential area under the flight path of the new runway, and 113 responses were collected from the control area. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied in order to examine the mental health effects of aircraft noise exposure taking respondents' noise sensitivity into consideration. The analysis revealed that the sensitive group showed a significant dose-response relationship between the psychiatric disorders detected by GHQ-28 and aircraft noise exposure. Furthermore, the relationship between the psychiatric disorders and the disturbances of daily life was analysed by multiple logistic regression analysis. The psychiatric disorders were found to be significantly associated with the disturbances caused during the period from evening to night (1800-2300 hours). The results suggest that reduction in the aircraft noise exposure during these hours would effectively mitigate the mental health effects observed in this area."

With a large percentage of the nation's air traffic controllers retiring within the next five years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will be hiring new controllers from many of the Collegiate Training Initiative (CTI) schools. Currently, the FAA is hiring new trainees from 14 CTI schools in the United States [1]. Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) is currently one of 14 CTI schools identified. It is important for the Federal Aviation Administration to have a selection process that accurately selects individuals most qualified for the position. Previous research has suggested that certain types of people are best fit for the air traffic control specialist position. The purpose of this research was to explore the relationships between air traffic management student success and anxiety and personality type. The study examined relationships between anxiety, personality type, and radar performance and final exam grades on ATC student academic success, in a sample of EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University ATC students. The results show that students have lower anxiety levels and are more extraverted than the general population of college students but did not support the hypothesis that students with low anxiety levels or extraverted personality types are more successful in the CTI program."

This paper deals with the policy of the University's Medical Faculty during the Nazi period, when it faced specific demands and opportunities. While the University's restructuring had been initiated by some active National Socialists, this process was pragmatically supported by the Medical Faculty as a whole in order to gain advantages from its location. In particular, the Faculty (1.) institutionalized racial hygiene - a chair for one of the most radical representatives of this subject in Germany was requested - and (2.) established collaboration with the ""Wehrmacht"". The newly opened up perspectives for research were seen as an opportunity. In fact, from 1940 the University of Gießen was frequented again by many medical students; in 1943, the Berlin Academy for Military Medicine relocated some institutes and scientists to the University of Gießen, as the capital had become too unsafe for them because of increasing air raids. © Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart."
"Performance enhancement in an uninhabited air vehicle task using psychophysiologically determined adaptive aiding","2007","Human Factors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36749037719&partnerID=40&md5=fc5fe65f69cbc0ebfc94bb0b7c7d3f9b","Objective: We show that psychophysiologically driven real-time adaptive aiding significantly enhances performance in a complex aviation task. A further goal was to assess the importance of individual operator capabilities when providing adaptive aiding. Background: Psychophysiological measures are useful for monitoring cognitive workload in laboratory and real-world settings. They can be recorded without intruding into task performance and can be analyzed in real time, making them candidates for providing operator functional state estimates. These estimates could be used to determine if and when system intervention should be provided to assist the operator to improve system performance. Methods: Adaptive automation was implemented while operators performed an uninhabited aerial vehicle task. Psychophysiological data were collected and an artificial neural network was used to detect periods of high and low mental workload in real time. The high-difficulty task levels used to initiate the adaptive automation were determined separately for each operator, and a group-derived mean difficulty level was also used. Results: Psychophysiologically determined aiding significantly improved performance when compared with the no-aiding conditions. Improvement was greater when adaptive aiding was provided based on individualized criteria rather than on group-derived criteria. The improvements were significantly greater than when the aiding was randomly provided. Conclusion: These results show that psychophysiologically determined operator functional state assessment in real time led to performance improvement when included in closed loop adaptive automation with a complex task. Application: Potential future applications of this research include enhanced workstations using adaptive aiding that would be driven by operator functional state."

The society puts a great strain on these organizations to rigorously manage the risks inherent in the technology they use and the products they produce. In this book, an organizational psychology view is taken to analyse what are the typical challenges of daily work in these environments. The analysis is based on a literature review about human and organizational factors in safety critical industries, and on the interviews of Finnish safety experts and safety managers from four different companies. In addition to this, personnel interviews conducted in the Finnish nuclear power plants are utilised. The authors suggest eight themes that arise as common organizational challenges across the industries, e.g. how the personnel understands the risks and what the role of rules and procedures in guiding the work activities is. The primary aim of this book is to contribute to the nuclear safety research and safety management discussion. However, the book is equally suitable for risk management, organizational development and human resources management specialists in different industries. The purpose is to encourage readers to consider how the human and organizational factors are seen in the field they work in. Copyright © VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland 2007."

Companies embrace it because it saves them money and teams work better. You cannot be perfect but you can mitigate losses caused by errors by having as many layers of defence as possible. You can also do this by: ■ Being aware of different personalities and how team members react under stress - take time to find out about your team members and look at your own personality and behaviour. ■ Encouraging feedback from our team to ensure we maintain situational awareness and make informed and agreed decisions - take time to look at past incidents and ask questions of your team when things have gone wrong and when they have gone right. ■ Communicating our plans, encouraging further input and modifying decisions accordingly - take time to brief and de-brief for a task. ■ Admitting our mistakes and gaining the trust of our team. ■ Giving the team the credit and asking for ways to improve. By following these rules, your team will efficiently complete tasks as a cohesive body, aware of everyone's input and worth. CRM is not just a theory. I have seen it in practice. Some might say it is common sense, but the thing about common sense is that it is not so common.

Background: Research has suggested certain biases against automation that influence human interaction with automation. We differentiated preconceived biases from post hoc biases and examined their effects on advice acceptance. Method: In Study 1 we examined operators' trust in and perceived reliability of humans versus automation of varying pedigree (expert vs. novice), based on written descriptions of these advisers prior to operators' interacting with these advisers. In Study 2 we examined participants' post hoc trust in, perceived reliability of, and dependence on these advisers after their objective experience of advisers' reliability (90% vs. 70%) in a luggage-screening task. Results: In Study 1 measures of perceived reliability indicated that automation was perceived as more reliable than humans across pedigrees. Measures of trust indicated that automated ""novices"" were trusted more than human ""novices""; human ""experts"" were trusted more than automated ""experts."" In Study 2, perceived reliability varied as a function of pedigree, whereas subjective trust was always higher for automation than for humans. Advice acceptance from novice automation was always higher than from novice humans. However, when advisers were 70% reliable, errors generated by expert automation led to a drop in compliance/reliance on expert automation relative to expert humans. Conclusion: Preconceived expectations of automation influence the use of these aids in actual tasks. Application: The results provide a reference point for deriving indices of ""optimal"" user interaction with decision aids and for developing frameworks of trust in decision support systems.

Background: Cockpit displays of traffic information (CDTIs) are being designed for use in airplane cockpits as responsibility for safe separation becomes shared between pilots and controllers. Of interest in this work is how characteristics of the alarm system such as threshold, modality, and number of alert levels impact concurrent task (flight control) performance and response to potential conflicts. Methods: Student pilots performed a tracking task analogous to flight control while simultaneously monitoring for air traffic conflicts with the aid of a CDTI alert as the threshold, modality, and level of alert was varied. Results: As the alerting system became more prone to false alerts, pilot compliance decreased and concurrent performance improved. There was some evidence of auditory preemption with auditory alerts as the false alarm rate increased. Finally, there was no benefit to a three-level system over a two-level system. Conclusion: There is justification for increased false alarm rates, as miss-prone systems appear to be costly. The 4:1 false alarm to miss ratio employed here improved accuracy and concurrent task performance. More research needs to address the potential benefits of likelihood alerting. Application: The issues addressed in this research can be applied to any imperfect alerting system such as in aviation, driving, or air traffic control. It is crucial to understand the performance consequences of new technology and the efficacy of potential mitigating design features within the specific context desired.

Members of the high status group showed an increase in adjustment over time, lower in-group bias and a stronger identification with the new merged organization. Path analyses further confirmed that identification with the new merged organization mediated the associations between perceptions of fairness and in-group bias as well as changes in adjustment over time.

Simulated signal lights and arrays were compared against dark and against dimly lighted backgrounds, and through simulated fog. Results: The results confirm that LED signal lights are brighter than incandescent signals at matched luminous intensities. Brightness relationships were unaffected by background light level, and by the number of signals viewed, but the simulated fog reduced the brightness difference between the incandescent and LED signal lights. Conclusions: The present results could not be accurately predicted by several previously published models of brightness appearance, probably because of differences in experimental conditions. We present a new model that can be used to predict signal light brightness for blue, white, and green signal colors. Except for very short-wavelength blue signal lights, the model was able to accurately predict the present brightness data as well as those from previously published independent experiments. This validation lends confidence to the generality of the model for predicting blue, white, and green signal light brightness, but different colors (e.g., yellow or red) remain to be tested and modeled using this approach.

Underlying SA in a domain are domain-independent cognitive abilities in perception, memory, attention and executive control. Individuals with lower underlying ability perform relatively poorly in complex dynamic real-world tasks. The first experiment examined whether cognitive skills training could overcome limitations in underlying SA ability that impact on complex dynamic task performance. Participants were taught a mix of cognitive management strategies (e.g. divided and focused attention and visual search) in a simulated air traffic control task. A second experiment investigated the link between underlying SA ability, TRACON and SAGAT, a widely used measure of domain-specific SA. In a third experiment, the focus was on encouraging participants to plan ahead and consider the interrelations of elements (aircraft) in the environment. Whilst both training methods ameliorated the negative impact that lower SA ability had on complex dynamic task performance, the results of the third study indicated that this may have been achieved through improved planning behaviour. Finally, participants with higher underlying SA ability performed well irrespective of training condition."

Particular emphasis is given to her performance on serial neuropsychological assessments while both on and off of the medication. Case Presentation: Each testing occasion included a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological functioning, coupled with a blinded flight evaluation by a standardization pilot. The first testing occasion was on day 6 of menses while the aviator was taking 25 mg sertraline PO QD. The second testing occasion was completed 1 mo later, on day 6 of menses, while off the sertraline. The aviator's performance was compared with normative data at each testing occasion, as well as for possible significant change between testing occasions. Discussion: An interpretation of this aviator's overall neuropsychological performance is discussed, with particular attention given to the potential cognitive effects of sertraline. In light of previously published aeromedical considerations related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use by aviators, the aeromedical considerations regarding this aviator's use of sertraline for PMDD are also highlighted.

We reviewed videotaped procedures where malpractice was alleged and resolved in court to evaluate potential contributing factors. We evaluated possible sources of complications related to cognitive science, systems error, equipment issues, and surgeon selection and training. The way the human brain's hard-wiring shapes information processing, as well as perceptual learning, can influence the risk of surgical complications. Situation awareness and principles derived from aviation crew resource management may be adapted to help avoid systems error. The current process used to select gynecologic surgeons and the structure of surgical training may need to be reconsidered. © 2007 AAGL."
"Fixed versus dynamic orientations in environmental learning from ground-level and aerial perspectives","2007","Psychological Research","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33947704563&partnerID=40&md5=5b99661381959ffe1e10c5b781cac656","Ground-level and aerial perspectives in virtual space provide simplified conditions for investigating differences between exploratory navigation and map reading in large-scale environmental learning. General similarities and differences in ground-level and aerial encoding have been identified, but little is known about the specific characteristics that differentiate them. One such characteristic is the need to process orientation; ground-level encoding (and navigation) typically requires dynamic orientations, whereas aerial encoding (and map reading) is typically conducted in a fixed orientation. The present study investigated how this factor affected spatial processing by comparing ground-level and aerial encoding to a hybrid condition: aerial-with-turns. Experiment 1 demonstrated that scene recognition was sensitive to both perspective (ground-level or aerial) and orientation (dynamic or fixed). Experiment 2 investigated brain activation during encoding, revealing regions that were preferentially activated perspective as in previous studies (Shelton and Gabrieli in J Neurosci 22:2711-2717, 2002), but also identifying regions that were preferentially activated as a function of the presence or absence of turns. Together, these results differentiated the behavioral and brain consequences attributable to changes in orientation from those attributable to other characteristics of ground-level and aerial perspectives, providing leverage on how orientation information is processed in everyday spatial learning. © Springer-Verlag 2007."

Replicating dangerous conditions particularly involving heavy machinery in the real world can be dangerous and costly. The use of VR is therefore appealing across many industries such as aviation, mining, and rail. However, while the number of training prototypes increase less focus is being given to appropriate evaluation of the training provided via this technology. Increasing skills acquisition and performance does not depend solely on the appropriate design of simulation training. Of equal importance are strong performance measures which can ultimately feedback on the success or otherwise of training and highlight any deficits to guide ongoing improvements. To ensure cognitive skills acquired in a virtual training environment (VTE) are transferable to the real world, training objectives need to be tied directly to realistic scenario events which in turn are directly linked to measures of specific required behaviors. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Method: The medical literature was reviewed and supplemented with internet searches for relevant information. Organizations including the Federal Aviation Administration, International Air Transport Association, Transportation Safety Board of Canada, and the Canadian Transportation Agency were contacted for unpublished information. Three cases of in-flight psychiatric emergencies in which two of the authors were involved are presented along with a review of relevant literature pertaining to the etiology and medical management of passenger misconduct. Recommendations for the in-flight management of disruptive passengers are discussed. Results: Incidents of in-flight passenger misconduct represent a serious threat to passenger safety. The three cases presented highlight the difficulties involved in managing incidents of passenger misconduct in the context of limited resources and treatment options aboard aircraft. Ambiguity remains in regard to the responding physician's medico-legal obligations (and liabilities) during the management of an unruly passenger. However, liability risks appear minimal at this time. Conclusions: Awareness of the causes of passenger misconduct is required to adequately prevent, identify, and treat in-flight cases of passenger misconduct. Although most physicians will not be obligated to respond, liability issues do not appear to be a major factor preventing the offer of medical assistance.

"CROSSFIRE: An IDE for operational training","2007","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027502554&partnerID=40&md5=fda65d4639e1512254f1fafb4f9bfbf3","We consider operational-level training to be targeted at decision makers; increasing the cognitive readiness of commanders, directors, or staff members in a military or civil organization. Operational-level training is very different from tactical training. Time, space, and forces may be very realistic or highly abstracted or aggregated, depending on the fidelity required to offer the targeted training opportunity. Displays can be symbolic or text-oriented, reflecting a closer approximation of realistic information. The time-model is turn-taking, and turns can simulate any fixed units of simulated time: hours, days, weeks, etc. We are in the final stages of developing a cognitivereadiness trainer for senior Air Force decision makers. The target training audience is senior decision makers in the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC), the Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staff, and the Combined Force Air Component Commander (CFACC) staff right up to the CAOC Director, the COMAFFOR and CFACC. The trainer is called CFACC Ace and it is being developed for the Air Force Research Laboratories, in Mesa, Arizona. It is the first trainer developed on CROSSFIRE, a new product being developed by MÄK Technologies. CROSSFIRE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the development of operational-level trainers. In CFACC Ace, the ability to model the entire area of operations and all of the individuals, organizations, and non-human factors that influence the decisions of the trainee, is key to developing realistic scenarios specifically designed to address training dealing with human behaviors, risk-management, resource allocation over time, effects-based operations, and many other instances where extended periods of simulated time are required to realistically play out trainee decision results in a an operational decision-making environment. CROSSFIRE is based on Eclipse, an open-source framework for building IDE's. Eclipse makes it economically feasible to build full-featured IDE's for specialized applications like joint staff training, or any other operational- level decision-making environment. CROSSFIRE features a distributed, agent-based architecture, with a powerful, customized modeling language specifically designed for operational-level scenario development and cognitive training. CROSSFIRE is also being used to develop a Joint Task Force staff trainer for Joint Forces Command (JFCOM). The trainer is designed to familiarize individual augmentees with the doctrinal and procedural workings of a task force. In this adaptation, the training environment is a Combined Task Force (CTF) staff simulating the organization, physical layout, processes, meetings, and battle rhythm of a modern CTF staff organization dealing with a difficult mission. But the training environment goes farther. It simulates the behavior or the individuals on the staff: the CTF commander, his chief of staff, the intelligence director, the operations director, etc. Each of these individuals can have unique personalities and knowledge and the trainee not only learns about how a staff works in terms of doctrine and battle rhythm, he also learns to deal with the personal interactions required to function effectively in such an organization."

Bruxism can cause pain and irreversible damage to the teeth, periodontium, masticatory muscles, and temporo-mandibular joint. Variables such as general stress, work-related stress, and personality traits have been increasingly considered as initiating, predisposing, and perpetuating factors for bruxism. We sought to evaluate the potential of work-related stress and personality factors to induce bruxism among military pilots and non-pilot officers. Methods: Subjects were 57 healthy male Israel Air Force officers (mean age 25.8 ± 4.3 yr). Of these, 17 were jet-pilots, 18 helicopter-pilots, and 22 non-pilot officers. Tooth-wear was classified according to a six-point scale. In addition, the subjects responded to a battery of psychological questionnaires for self-assessment of stress at the workplace and their coping behavior. Results: Bruxism of clinical importance (i.e., with dentin exposure) was found in 69% of the aircrew members but only 27% of the non-pilot group. No difference was found between groups regarding stress levels. Discussion: Military aircrews may be relatively vulnerable to deleterious bruxism as well as other signs of chronic stress. Among bruxers, pilots tended to show coping strategies that were significantly more emotional and less task-oriented than non-pilots, whereas non-bruxers showed no significant differences in coping behavior. This study suggest that integrating dental and psychological preventive intervention may be helpful. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association."

In particular, we created a trauma team course for novices, and allowed 15 students to practise team skills in 5 full-scale scenarios. Students' team behaviour was video-recorded and students' attitude towards safe teamwork was assessed using a questionnaire before and after team practice. Results: Nine of 10 observed team skills improved significantly in response to practice, in parallel with a global rating of team skills. In contrast, no change in attitude toward safe teamwork was registered. Conclusion: The use of team skills in 5 scenarios in a full-scale patient simulator environment implementing a training method based on targets and known principles in cognitive psychology improved individual team skills but had no immediate effect on attitude toward safe patient care. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

In the last years the performance assessment was successfully combined with a psycho-physiological approach for the objective assessment of the levels of physiological arousal and psychological load. These methods are based on statistical reference data. For the enhancement of the statistical power of the evaluation methods, both were actually implemented into a comparable terrestrial task: the flight simulator test of DLR in the selection procedure for ab initio pilot applicants for civil airlines. In the first evaluation study 134 male subjects were analysed. Subjects underwent a flight simulator test including three tasks, which were evaluated by instructors applying well-established and standardised rating scales. The principles of the performance algorithms of the docking training were adapted for the automated flight performance assessment. They are presented here. The increased human errors under instrument flight conditions without visual feedback required a manoeuvre recognition algorithm before calculating the deviation of the flown track from the given task elements. Each manoeuvre had to be evaluated independently of former failures. The expert rated performance showed a highly significant correlation with the automatically calculated performance for each of the three tasks: r<inf>t 1</inf> = .883, r<inf>t 2</inf> = .874, r<inf>t 3</inf> = .872, respectively. An automated algorithm successfully assessed the flight performance.

DESIGN: Air Show attendees (N = 157) were recruited by advertisements in the local media and completed an Internet-administered battery of questionnaires. RESULTS: Based on previously established cut-offs, 22 percent respondents had clinically significant PTSS and 24 percent had clinically significant depressive symptoms. Clinically significant symptoms were associated with posttrauma impairment in social and occupational functioning. Acute distress was associated with several variables, including aspects of Air Show trauma exposure, severity of prior trauma exposure, low posttrauma social support (ie, negative responses by others), indices of poor coping (eg, intolerance of uncertainty, rumination about the trauma), and elevated scores on anxiety sensitivity, the personality trait of absorption, and dissociative tendencies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that clinically significant acute distress is common in the aftermath of witnessed trauma. The statistical predictors (correlates) of acute distress were generally consistent with the results of studies of other forms of trauma. People with elevated scores on theoretical vulnerability factors (eg, elevated anxiety sensitivity) were particularly likely to develop acute distress."

We refined a closed-loop adaptive system for varying the strength of turbulence in a professional simulator. In the experimental condition, twenty-four subjects flew three blocks with ten 2-min flight sections under varying turbulences. Each of the three blocks applied different combinations of autonomic measures for adaptive automation. Physiological responses were calculated every 2 min for adjusting the turbulence strength for the next 2 min, dependent on an individual setpoint. Another twenty-four yoked control subjects flew the same sequence of turbulences as the corresponding experimental subjects without adaptive automation. By combining nonspecific skin conductance responses and heart rate variability, experimental subjects' skin conductance responses oscillated very close to the individual setpoint, indicating a constant vigilance level as a result of adaptive control compared to yoked control subjects. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007."

Prominent examples are die programs directed by Yerkes in World War I to develop the Army Alpha test and several programs in World War II, including The American Soldier diat assessed soldiers' attitudes during the war; a program for selecting agents for the Office of Strategic Services; and the Aviation Psychology Program to select and classify applicants for flight training in the Army Air Forces. Highlights of these programs are presented here, with special attention given to by far the largest, the Air Forces program. After World War Il, many of the hundreds of psychologist veterans became prominent research psychologists. Most became university professors. Among those who continued to work in applied settings was John Flanagan who had served as Chief of the Army Air Forces Psychology Branch. (After the war, Saul Sells succeeded Flanagan as Head of the Aviation Psychology program.) Flanagan founded the American Institutes for Research (AIR), the earliest mission of which was to select flight personnel for civilian airlines. Another part of the AIR mission was to enhance civilian air safety by assuring the widespread use of Flanagan's critical-incident procedures (or near-accident reports) that now serve to reduce accident rates in a variety of industries as well as in aviation.

Many people seem to believe that there is no scientific consensus about climate change and that individual behavioural change is irrelevant in the face of uncertainty. Such a 'psychology of denial' seems particularly strong in the context of air travel, the fastest growing transport sector. This paper seeks to understand this phenomenon by analysing the discourses surrounding air travel. Four major industry discourses are identified: air travel is energy efficient and accounts only for marginal emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>; air travel is economically and socially too important to be restricted; fuel use is constantly minimized and new technology will solve the problem, and air travel is treated unfairly in comparison to other means of transport. The validity of these claims is evaluated based on data and material presented in the scientific literature. Results show that there are substantial gaps between the discourses and the reality of aviation's environmental performance, which might partially explain the controversial understanding of air travel and its environmental consequences among the public. © 2007 S.

"A causal modeling framework for assessing organizational factors and their impacts on safety performance","2006","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892638971&partnerID=40&md5=30efbca2923027d14022a03036e3794e","Management and organizational factors are increasingly cited as major contributors to operational safety problems in complex technological systems. A number of major events have revealed elements of organizational factors and safety culture to be among the primary or contributing causes. This paper describes a causal modeling framework to understand how organizational safety management practices can be measured, how those practices are linked to the human performance, and how this linkage impacts total risk outcome of the system. The proposed causal model is built on a combination of selected theories and methodologies in diverse domains of management, organizational psychology, human performance reliability, and risk analysis. It includes a macro-level framework of interactions of Business Management Practices (BMPs) and Safety Management Practices ( SMPs). The causal model focuses on SMPs and their detailed paths of influence, defined in such a way to facilitate developments of reliable predictors of safety performance. SMPs are the systematic and planned management-driven activities that aim at controlling hazards by preventing and/or intervening in the causation process of accidents and incidents. In the proposed, the SMPs are represented through ""outward"" and ""perceived"" factors. The former are those that can be assessed by objective auditing, interview and observation. The latter are the perceptions of people regarding safety management practices, as assessed by perception surveys. Although these two dimensions are interrelated, they are causal factors of human action through different paths of influence. In developing a representation of the SMPs for use in the model, the following points are considered: (1) different dimensions of the SMPs and their interdependency, (2) different measurement approaches, and (3) possible paths of influence. The full set of these aspects has not been considered in previous safety-oriented causal models. Some models have used safety management factors, mostly outward SMPs. Others have concentrated on safety climate factors, primarily perceived SMPs. Some of the methods have tried to combine the two, but failed to consider their interdependency, apply proper measurement approaches, and/or specify appropriate paths of influence. The proposed approach is the combination of a cross-level safety analysis and multi-layered safety modeling approach. It starts from outward SMPs (organization level), which impact the team (group level) and create team performance. The effects of human actions and other team factors (e.g. resources) on the team performance are represented through team effectiveness model. The Outward SMPs affect all team effectiveness factors (e.g. human actions and resources). Perceived SMPs are the reflection of Outward SMPs on a human model (individual level). The multi-layered safety modeling approach is adopted from Hybrid Causal Logic (HCL) developed by Mosleh et al [1]. HCL is a combination of Event Sequence Diagrams (ESDs), Fault Trees (FTs) and Baysian Belief Net (BBNs). Team performance is integrated to the component performance model (failure events in FTs) using the Omega Factor approach [2]. The fault tree outputs (hardware (HW) and human (HU) failure rates) are plugged into the ESDs. The model is based on the following three hypotheses: (1) ""Perceived SMPs"" mediate the effects of ""Outward SMPs"" on human action, (2) the effects of ""Outward SMPs"" and ""Perceived SMPs"" on human action are mediated by the individual's psychological, cognitive and physical states, and (3)""Perceived SMPs"" is a function of ""Outward SMPs"", the nature of industry (e.g., aviation, nuclear), size of organization, the department or division (e.g., maintenance), the job responsibility (e.g., technicians, engineers, inspectors), knowledge, and some other personal factors (e.g., age, gender). As a final step, based on these hypotheses and utilizing the IDAC model [3], detailed paths of influence of ""outward SMPs"" to human action are proposed. As the research leading to the development of the methodology was done for the US Federal Aviation Administration, an actual example of the methodology from the aviation field is used to demonstrate its features and advantages. © 2006 by ASME."

The society puts a great strain on these organisations to rigorously manage the risks inherent in the technology they use and the products they produce. In this book, an organisational psychology view is taken to analyse what are the typical challenges of daily work in these environments. The analysis is based on a literature review about human and organisational factors in safety critical industries, and on the interviews of Finnish safety experts and safety managers from four different companies. In addition to this, personnel interviews conducted in the Finnish nuclear power plants are utilised. The authors come up with eight themes that seem to be common organizational challenges cross the industries. These include e.g. how does the personnel understand the risks and what is the right level for rules and procedures to guide the work activities. The primary aim of this book is to contribute to the Finnish nuclear safety research and safety management discussion. However, the book is equally suitable for risk management, organizational development and human resources management specialists in different industries. The purpose is to encourage readers to consider how the human and organizational factors are seen in the field they work in. Copyright © VTT 2006."

Design errors that are attributable to human-system interaction failures are not pure engineering design issues, but a multidisciplinary subject with related other areas such as management, psychology, physiology or ergonomics. To identify such design errors (called design-induced errors) in accident reports is important for designing more reliable systems. However, the lack of precise definitions of the concept of design-induced error and the diversity of expression of such failures make it difficult to retrieve relevant documents from accident reports. This paper describes how an ontology and annotation scheme can help to overcome such limitations. Engineering designers can be assisted by the developed ontology and annotation scheme to reason on the issues of design induced error. © 2006 IEEE."

Background: Identifying variables that predict skilled performance in a complex task aids in understanding the nature of skill and also aids in the selection of operators to perform that task. SA is thought to be an important predictor of performance. SA is often thought to be based on underlying cognitive mechanisms. Method: Three performance measures taken from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Air Traffic Scenarios Test, the low-fidelity simulation component of the FAA's controller selection battery, were used as criterion variables in a hierarchical regression. After predicting performance based on a battery of cognitive (e.g., intelligence, working memory, spatial memory) and noncognitive tests (e.g., cognitive style, personality, demographics), we added measures of SA. Results: SA did provide increases in prediction, but only when measured with the Situation Present Assessment Method, an on-line query method. When the same questions were asked offline, SA did not enter the model in two cases and improved prediction by only 2% in the third. Conclusion: Thus, some measures of SA do show incremental validity, even against a backdrop of a large number of cognitive variables. Application: On-line measures of SA can be a worthwhile addition to standard batteries of tests used to predict performance in cognitively oriented industrial tasks.

From the early beginning of use of our Centrifuge, use in selection was primary task. As a functional ""endpoints"" we use criteria: loss of peripheral vision, extreme pulse rate (above 180 b.p.m.), arrhythmias and loss of consciousness. The key-method in selection the candidate who tolerates +Gz stress on the best way is selection by common selective centrifuge ""Test of linear increasing of acceleration"" (TOLIA). We used gradual onset rate (GOR - 0.1 G/s) and maximum/peak value: +5.5 Gz, +6.0 Gz and 7.0 Gz. Applied peak value depends on the goal of the test. The lowest peak value is for candidates planned for Air Academy, higher peak value is for those pilots planned for training to supersonic combat aircrafts and the highest peak value is for pilots who are planned to fly High performance combat aircrafts. We examined 2192 candidates in the last 20 years. Eleven subjects experienced G-LOC episodes. All episodes of G-LOC had occurred occasionally and without warning symptoms (loss of peripheral vision, gray out, blackout). The percentage of subjects having G-LOC episodes was 0.50%. Nine subjects experienced G-LOC during primary selection (+5.5 Gz), one G-LOC were observed at secondary selection (+6.0 Gz) and one G-LOC was observed during tertiary selection (+7 Gz). G-LOC is the only ""endpoint"" in the centrifuge selection which disqualifies the candidate at once and forever for planned flying duties. The other ""endpoints"" (loss of peripheral vision, heart rate above 180 b.p.m., arrhythmias) allow one more testing, not less than seven days later. © 2006 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest."

The aim of the first study was to explore a set of psychophysiological measures with respect to ATC workload sensitivity and feasibility at the workplace. Nearly all physiological measures showed the expected changes during work. Significant positive correlations were found between cardiovascular responses and the number of aircraft under control, especially heavy, fast, climbing, and descending aircraft. The following en-route (Study 2) and tower (Study 3) simulations identified the relative impact of air traffic features. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, self-reported concentration, and upset were significantly higher in the simulations with 12 aircraft continuously under control compared to only 6. A high versus low number of potential conflicts between aircraft in the en-route setting (Study 2) also caused significant increases of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, self-reported concentration, and upset. On the basis of these results, a new workload model for air traffic controllers was suggested and implemented. © 2006 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies."

Presented is a naval flight officer whose personality traits were a threat to these key tenets and ultimately warranted removal from flight status. Case Report: A naval flight officer was twice referred to Human Factors Boards (HFBs) after concerns were raised about her emotional stability in and out of the cockpit. Her history revealed multiple clinical presentations revealing personality characteristics that should have raised immediate concern about her aeronautical adaptability. Formal psychiatric evaluation after her second HFB confirmed the presence of personality traits incompatible with aviation duty, but not until she had served nearly 4 yr as an aviation officer. Discussion: Aeronautical adaptability is a U.S. Naval term used to describe an individual's ability to work successfully in the aviation environment. Naval aviation personnel are considered not aeronautically adaptable/adapted if diagnosed with a ""personality disorder or prominent personality traits that adversely affect flight safety, mission completion, or crew coordination."" The Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army endorse similar concepts. Except for the U.S. Navy definition, aeronautical adaptability does not include formal DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, and, thus, flight surgeons and aviation medical examiners often make difficult aeromedical dispositions based on vague and subjective criteria. Conclusions: Determining aeronautical adaptability is not a simple, solitary process. It requires heightened suspicion, continual surveillance of suspect aviators, and collaboration from aviation medical professionals to ensure aviation safety.

Thus, this study was carried out to investigate whether small, non-intrusive sports recorders can be used for in-flight data collection for research purposes. Data was collected from real and simulated flights with student pilots using the Polar Team System sports recorder and the Vitaport II, a clinical and research recording device.

A better understanding of accident factors allows for better development of preventive measures. This study analyzes ultralight accidents with respect to significant factors related to active and latent failures, as referred to in Reason's Swiss cheese model of human error. Methods: There were 66 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ultralight accident reports that were examined from 1985-2004. Contextual information about active and latent failures was identified, compiled, and cross-referenced with pilot, aircraft, and accident information for evidence of significant relationships. Results: Pilots with less than 40 make/model-specific flying hours were significantly more likely to crash fatally (χ2 = 9.07; p < 0.005; df = 1) than other pilots and/or because of losing control (χ2 = 7.24; p < 0.05; df = 1) than other accident causes. In contrast, pilots with 40 or more make/model-specific flying hours were significantly more likely to crash as a result of engine failure (χ2 = 9.33; p < 0.005; df = 1). Loss of control as an active failure was usually associated with such latent failures as strong winds and insufficient mission planning, while the engine failure accidents involved inadequate maintenance. Conclusion: In order to reduce accident prevalence, ultralight self-regulation organizations should focus on training in mission planning, aircraft familiarity, and proper maintenance procedures. Further research should concentrate on explaining the prevalence of the active and latent failures shown here and determining the effects of the FAA's new light sport aircraft category. © by Aerospace Medical Association."

The traditional approach to the development of these skills requires pilots to directly engage with potentially hazardous events. Using low-flying as a context, the present study sought to test whether engagement with hazards in a simulated environment, together with feedback concerning performance, would improve pilots' risk assessment during a subsequent simulated test flight. The results indicated that engagement with the hazards, rather than the provision of feedback per se, was associated with behavior that reduced the risk to the aircraft, while maintaining operational performance. It was concluded that exposure to hazards within a simulated environment could provide the basis for the development of risk assessment skills amongst less experienced pilots. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Aims: This study attempted to ascertain how much subjective fatigue short-haul pilots reported, and makes comparisons between low-cost and scheduled airline pilots. Methods: Pilots completed anonymous questionnaires (encompassing aviation factors, flight experience and a fatigue scale) posted on the Professional Pilots' Rumours Network website. Results: Data were collected from 162 short-haul pilots and statistical adjustment for operational factors was made. Seventy-five percent reported severe fatigue and 81% reported the fatigue to be worse than 2 years ago. Eighty percent considered their thought processes were reduced while flying. Severe fatigue was reported more frequently by low-cost airline pilots than scheduled airline pilots (P = 0.05) and fatigue ratings were higher in this group (P = 0.03). Pilots who reported regularly flying into their 'discretion' hours had lower physical and psychological health, and overall fatigue scores, and poorer self-rated general health. Flying into discretion time occurred no more frequently in low-cost airline pilots than scheduled airline pilots. Conclusions: Identifiable fatigue problems are reported by short-haul pilots, but this cannot be attributed solely to the work schedules of low-cost airlines as regular use of discretion time appears to be associated with fatigue regardless of airline. © 2006 Oxford University Press."

A troublesome aftermath followed, with rumors on potential toxic exposures and health consequences. Health concerns remained even though no excess morbidity was predicted in retrospective risk evaluations. This study aimed to assess to what extent the rescue workers attribute long-term physical complaints to this disaster, including its aftermath, and to examine associations between such attribution and types of exposure and background variables. Methods: Historic cohort study that collected questionnaire data on occupational disaster exposure, attribution of physical complaints, and background variables on average 8.5 years postdisaster. For the present study the workers who were exposed to the disaster were selected from the historic cohort, i.e. the professional firefighters (n = 334), police officers (n = 834), and accident and wreckage investigators (n = 241) who performed disaster-related tasks. Results: Across the three occupational groups, a consistent percentage (ranging from 43% to 49%) of exposed workers with long-term physical complaints attributed these to the disaster, including its aftermath. Those with more physical complaints attributed these to a stronger degree. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that attribution was significantly more often reported by firefighters who rescued people, and by police officers who reported the identification and recovery of or search for victims and human remains, clean-up, or security and surveillance of the disaster area; who witnessed the immediate disaster scene; who had a close one affected by the disaster; and who perceived the disaster as the worst thing that ever happened to them. Age, sex and educational level were not significantly associated with attribution. Conclusion: This study provides further cross-sectional evidence for the role of causal attribution in post-disaster subjective physical health problems. After on average 8.5 years, almost a third (32%) of all the exposed workers, and almost half (45%) of the exposed workers with physical complaints, attributed these complaints to the disaster, including its aftermath. The similarity of the results across the occupational groups suggests a general rather than an occupation-specific attribution process. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether causal disaster attribution leads to persistence of post-disaster complaints and health care utilization. © 2006 Slottje et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the first section, some general considerations regarding the issues studied in the field of Aviation Psychology are reviewed. Starting from Freud's early contributions on the genesis of phobias of the 1890s, concerning the separation of phobias from obsessions and the concept of anxiety neurosis, the psychodynamics of phobias is discussed, especially regarding the concept of evolutionary hierarchy of anxiety suggested by Gabbard (2000). In this perspective, the author suggests a phenomenological picture of fear of flying and a detailed description of the psychological situation of the person affected by fear of flying: the feelings of persecution and emphatic isolation, the repression of aggressive drives, the social pressure and the impossibility of physical movements are examined. Fear of flying is a typical example of over-determination of the neurotic symptom."

If flight display symbols are to be safely recognized by pilots, it is necessary that they can be easily discriminated from each other. Sometimes psychophysical measurements can answer this question, but computational modeling may be required to assess the numerous conditions and even help design the empirical experiments that may be needed. Here we present an image discrimination model that includes position compensation. The model takes as input the luminance values for the pixels of two symbol images, the effective viewing distance, and gives as output the discriminability in just-noticeable-differences (d') and the x and y offset in pixels needed to minimize the discriminability. The model predictions are shown to be a useful upper bound for human symbol identification performance. © 2006 SPIE-IS&T."

The irony is that this level of sensitivity stands in contrast to the significant changes in vehicle 'feel' accompanying modern trends in automotive design, such as drive-by-wire and increased automation. The aim of this paper is to move the debate from the anecdotal to the scientific level. This is achieved by using the Brunel University driving simulator to replicate some of these trends and changes by presenting (or removing) different forms of non-visual vehicle feedback, and measuring resultant driver situational awareness (SA) using a probe-recall method. The findings confirm that vehicle feedback plays a key role in coupling the driver to the dynamics of their environment (Moray 2004), with the role of auditory feedback particularly prominent. As a contrast, drivers in the study also rated their self-perceived levels of SA and a concerning dissociation occurred between the two sets of results. Despite the large changes in vehicle feedback presented in the simulator, and the measured changes in SA, drivers appeared to have little self-awareness of these changes. Most worryingly, drivers demonstrated little awareness of diminished SA. The issues surrounding vehicle feedback are therefore similar to the classic problems and ironies studied in aviation and automation, and highlight the role that ergonomics can also play within the domain of contemporary vehicle design. © 2006 Taylor & Francis."

It comprises track-to-train communications and intelligent on-board systems providing an unprecedented degree of support to the train driver. ERTMS is designed to improve safety, capacity and performance, as well as facilitating interoperability across the European rail network. In many ways, particularly from the human factors perspective, ERTMS has parallels with automation concepts in the aviation and automotive industries. Lessons learned from both these industries are that such a technology raises a number of human factors issues associated with train driving and operations. The interaction amongst intelligent agents throughout the system must be effectively coordinated to ensure that the strategic benefits of ERTMS are realised. This paper discusses the psychology behind some of these key issues, such as Mental Workload (MWL), interface design, user information requirements, transitions and migration and communications. Relevant experience in aviation and vehicle automation is drawn upon to give an overview of the human factors challenges facing the UK rail industry in implementing ERTMS technology. By anticipating and defining these challenges before the technology is implemented, it is hoped that a proactive and structured programme of research can be planned to meet them. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

However, little is known about whether or not different populations exhibit similar levels of individual variability. In the present study, we examined individual variability in performance impairment due to sleep loss in a highly select population of military jet pilots. Ten active-duty F-117 pilots were deprived of sleep for 38 h and studied repeatedly in a high-fidelity flight simulator. Data were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA to quantify individual variability. Statistically significant, systematic individual differences in the effects of sleep deprivation were observed, even when baseline differences were accounted for. The findings suggest that highly select populations may exhibit individual differences in vulnerability to performance impairment from sleep loss just as the general population does. Thus, the scientific and operational communities' reliance on group data as opposed to individual data may entail substantial misestirnation of the impact of job-related Stressors on safety and performance.

STUDY SELECTION: A total of 13 studies were reviewed, including 5 studies of teamwork, communication, and safety attitudes in aviation; 2 studies comparing these factors in aviation and health care; and 6 studies of assertive behavior and decision making by nurses. Studies lacking methodological rigor or focusing on medication errors and deviant behavior were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pilot attitudes regarding interpersonal interaction on the flight deck predicted effective performance and were amenable to behavior-based training to improve team performance. Nursing knowledge was inconsistently accessed in decision making. Findings regarding nurse assertiveness were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation of training concepts and safety methods from other fields will have limited impact on perinatal safety without an examination of the contextual experiences of nurses and other health care providers in working to prevent patient harm."

This paper describes a new capability for generating multiple human performance predictions from a single task specification as a function of different performance objective functions. As a demonstration of this capability, the Cognitive Constraint Modeling approach was used to develop models for several tasks across two interfaces from the aviation domain. Performance objectives are explicitly declared as part of the model, and the CORE (Constraint-based Optimal Reasoning Engine) architecture itself formally derives the detailed strategies that are maximally adapted to these objectives. The models are analyzed for emergent strategic variation, comparing those optimized for task time with those optimized for working memory load. The approach has potential application in user interface and procedure design. Copyright 2006 ACM."

Two psychiatrists were called in immediately. One provided a medico-psychological assistance in the military camp of Port-Bouët, where runaway expatriates were regrouped. The intensity of the shock due to the aggressive behaviour of people lived with peacefully until then was shown by a particular psychopathology, both individual and collective. All wanted to escape from the chaos and wanted to leave immediately; but seats in planes were limited. For ten days violence erupted everywhere, outside as well as inside.

HIV+ participants performed significantly worse than the HIV- participants on the UFOV, particularly on the Divided Attention subtest. Poor UFOV performance was associated with higher accident rates in the past year, with a trend for NP impairment to also predict more accidents. The highest number of accidents occurred in the group with a ""high risk"" UFOV designation and NP impairment; this category correctly classified 93% of HIV+ participants as to who did, and did not, have an accident.

Previously, we used synthetic Aviator Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS-9) imagery to demonstrate that the capacity to detect motion-defined form was degraded at low levels of illumination (see Macuda et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2004). To validate our simulated NVG results, the current study evaluated observer's ability to detect motion-defined form through a real ANVIS-9 system. The image sequences consisted of a target (square) that moved at a different speed than the background, or only depicted the moving background. For each trial, subjects were shown a pair of image sequences and required to indicate which sequence contained the target stimulus. Mean illumination and hence image noise level was varied by means of Neutral Density (ND) filters placed in front of the NVG objectives. At each noise level, we tested subjects at a series of target speeds. With both real and simulated NVG imagery, subjects had increased difficulty detecting the target with increased noise levels, at both slower and higher target speeds. These degradations in performance should be considered in operational planning. Further research is necessary to expand our understanding of the impact of NVG-produced noise on visual mechanisms."

The authors found that when targets were sampled with replacement and repetition, participant screeners relied on recognizing familiar targets and had great difficulty using category-general knowledge. The authors observed a ""heartbeat"" in detection performance - it improved while test images repeated but dropped sharply when unfamiliar targets from the same categories appeared. This reliance on familiarity illuminates the processes of categorization under conditions of visual complexity and suggests limits on those processes.

Fatigue countermeasures are usually employed by a relatively small number of military members engaged in sustained or continuous operations when sleep is not an option. Clinical treatments are available at any time as required to treat medical conditions. The issue of importance for the operational community, with regard to both clinical use of psychopharmaceuticals and performance maintenance through fatigue countermeasures, should be whether the medication impairs operationally relevant performance, assuming the disorder for which the medication is prescribed does not in itself prohibit operational duties. Applied research paradigms are generally discussed for assessing and transitioning pharmaceutical compounds from the laboratory to the operational environment. Tier 1 focuses on quantifying the impact of stressors and interventions in healthy members of the general population, while Tier 2 testing would use military or operationally matched volunteers in simulated or actual field environments. The section papers address two areas of operational relevance-the Caldwell and Caldwell paper presents guidelines for the use of fatigue countermeasures, and the Rowland paper discusses the potential effects of ketamine, an agent intended to replace morphine as a battlefield analgesic, on cognition.

In the use of personality scales for selection, the impact of social desirability (SD) has been cited as a concern. Study 1 addressed the impact of SD on responses to the Personality Characteristic Inventory (PCI) and NEO-FFI. This was achieved by contrasting scores from active astronauts (N=65) with scores of successful astronaut applicants (N=63), and between pilots applicants (N=1271) and pilot research subjects (N=120). Secondly, personality scores were correlated with scores on the Marlow Crown Social Desirability Scale among applicants to managerial positions (N=120). The results indicated that SD inflated scores on PCI scales assessing negative interpersonal characteristics, and impacted on four of five scales in NEO-FFI. Still, the effect sizes were small or moderate. Study 2 addressed performance implications of SD during an assessment of males applying to work as rescue personnel operations in the North Sea (N=22). The results showed that SD correlated negatively with cognitive test performance, and positively with discrepancy in performance ratings between self and two observers. In conclusion, caution is needed in interpreting personality scores in applicant populations. SD may be a negative predictor for performance under stress. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Flight attendants, as an occupational group, had a distinctive exposure to September 11. In addition to work-related exposure in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, flight attendants have experienced major and ongoing changes in their work environment and job description and many have been exposed to potentially traumatic incidents on the job. Analysis of survey and focus group data from flight attendants in the Association of Flight Attendants showed high reported stress and related mental health and behavioral impacts among flight attendants since September 11. A significant new finding is that the effect of continued trauma in the flight attendants' work environment impacted their ability to recover from the original trauma associated with the events of that day. This study highlights the role of the after-effects of a traumatic event on trauma response and suggests that direct exposure, as traditionally defined, is not necessarily a primary mediating factor in trauma response for this occupational group. © 2005 Chevron Publishing."

Specifically, personality trait data collected from astronauts, pilots, Antarctic personnel, and other groups over a 15-yr period is discussed with particular emphasis on research in space and space analogue environments. The UT Human Factors Research Project conducts studies in personality and group dynamics in aviation, space, and medicine. Current studies include personality determinants of professional cultures, team effectiveness in both medicine and aviation, and personality predictors of long-term astronaut performance. The Project also studies the design and effectiveness of behavioral strategies used to minimize error and maximize team performance in safety-critical work settings. A multi-year personality and performance dataset presents many opportunities for research, including long-term and follow-up studies of human performance, analyses of trends in recruiting and attrition, and the ability to adapt research design to operational changes and methodological advances. Special problems posed by such long-duration projects include issues of confidentiality and security, as well as practical limitations imposed by current peer-review and short-term funding practices. Practical considerations for ongoing dataset management include consistency of assessment instruments over time, variations in data acquisition from one year to the next, and dealing with changes in theory and practice that occur over the life of the project. A fundamental change in how research into human performance is funded would be required to ensure the ongoing development of such long-duration research databases."
"Phobic fear of flying in aircrews: Epidemiological aspects and comorbidity","2005","Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20044380374&partnerID=40&md5=d0f9b0b4aa9e60dd37c23cd08309ab94","Background: Phobic fear of flying may affect aircrew members during any phase of their flying careers. Symptoms are beyond voluntary control and may lead patients to avoid flying and seek medical advice. Methods: Of 1101 psychiatric files from our institute for 1985-2002, 1 50 represented cases of fliers who suffered from phobic fear of flying. Data collected from those files included assessment of fear-evoking situations, type of aircraft, class of aircrew duties, aircraft accident history, past medical history, age, and associated psychiatric comorbidity. Results: We compared a group of 56 pilots with 94 other aircrew members. Results included 143 cases of flight phobia behavior and 7 cases of anxiety about parachuting. Flight phobia was less frequent among pilots (37.4%) than the other aircrew members (62.6%). We found a history of aircraft accident to the patient or an acquaintance in 25% of the cases. Observed comorbid psychiatric disorders (54%) consisted of depressive disorders (22%), anxiety disorders (16%), and personality disorders (7.4%). Fixed-wing pilots and aircrews members had a higher incidence of depression than did rotary-wing pilots and crew-members (p < 0.05). Rotary-wing pilots and crewmembers had a higher rate of anxiety disorders (p < 0.05). Discussion: Flight phobia encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical origins that may lead pilots or other aircrew members to refuse to fly. We recommend a careful psychiatric evaluation and close follow-up to adequately diagnose fliers with flight phobic reactions, as well as establishing adequate medical and/or psychological treatment.

In the aftermath there were speculations about the cause of the crash, potential exposures to hazardous materials due to the disaster and the health consequences. Starting in 2000, the Epidemiological Study Air Disaster in Amsterdam (ESADA) aimed to assess the long-term health effects of occupational exposure to this disaster on professional assistance workers. Methods/Design: Epidemiological study among all the exposed professional fire-fighters and police officers who performed disaster-related task(s), and hangar workers who sorted the wreckage of the aircraft, as well as reference groups of their non-exposed colleagues who did not perform any disaster-related tasks. The study took place, on average, 8.5 years after the disaster. Questionnaires were used to assess details on occupational exposure to the disaster. Health measures comprised laboratory assessments in urine, blood and saliva, as well as self-reported current health measures, including health-related quality of life, and various physical and psychological symptoms. Discussion: In this paper we describe and discuss the design of the ESADA. The ESADA will provide additional scientific knowledge on the long-term health effects of technological disasters on professional workers. © 2005 Slottje et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
"Luminous efficiency and the measurement of daytime displays, signals, and visors","2005","Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-18244397207&partnerID=40&md5=5dcdb902ebc21a38358aa343f4554368","Purpose: Measurements concerning the usability or safety of optical equipment are based on assumptions regarding luminous efficiency. The current luminous efficiency functions are derived from human sensitivity experiments taken at low light levels compared with the outdoor day-time environment. The amount of error induced by extrapolating from low light level data to high light level applications is not known. We sought to determine whether standard luminous efficiency curves CIE V(λ) and CIE Heterochromatic Brightness Matching are appropriate for measuring day-use optical equipment such as display phosphors, lasers, LEDs, and laser eye protection, which are becoming more common in aviation. Methods: Flicker photometry and successive heterochromatic brightness matching were used to measure changes in luminance efficiency functions with increasing levels (1, 10, 100, and 1000 ft.) of light adaptation. Results: Luminous efficiency was found to depend on both the method and the reference intensity with which the measurements were taken. For heterochromatic brightness matching, luminous efficiency increased for longer wavelengths as reference intensity increased. Peak luminous efficiency shifted from approximately 540 nm to greater than 600 nm with increasing intensity. Peak luminous efficiency was constant for flicker photometry across all intensities, but the function narrowed slightly at 100 fL. Conclusion: Luminous efficiency curves measured at high reference intensities are substantially different from the standard luminous efficiency functions. Caution should be used when measuring spectrally narrow and bright sources such as lasers and LEDs with a V(λ) corrected photometer because the measured luminance may correlate poorly with perceived brightness."
"Wrist vibration affects the production of finely graded forces","2005","Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-18244383522&partnerID=40&md5=e78f6b92890b0d35d148fcf04d61c5f1","Introduction: It is still unclear how central commands and afferent feedback interact to produce finely graded forces. To explore this question, we experimentally degraded afferent responsiveness using wrist vibration. Methods: Subjects grasped an isometric joystick with their preferred hand and produced forces of different magnitudes and directions according to visually presented vectors. In one condition, the dorsal and palmar sides of the wrist were vibrated at 80 Hz to degrade proprioception; in another condition, the wrist was not vibrated. Results: Response magnitude averaged 2.46 kg of force (kgf) without, and decreased to 1.90 kgf with vibration. The coefficient of magnitude variation was vibration-independent and averaged 0.30 kgf. The directional error of responses and its standard deviation were also vibration-independent, averaging -2.6° and ± 17°, respectively. Subjects' maximum voluntary force was 9.77 kgf without, and decreased to 8.83 kgf with vibration. Conclusion: Our findings clearly indicate that afferent feedback plays a role in the production of finely graded forces, probably by facilitating descending motor commands."

This study focuses on an aeroplane crash on an Amsterdam suburb. The ongoing Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam has one pre-disaster and several post-disaster observations, making it possible to study changes in health, taking pre-disaster health characteristics into account. Methods: Three exposure groups are distinguished: those living within a radius of 1km from the disaster (initial n = 39), those living between a radius of 1 and 2km from the disaster (initial n = 56), and those living in the rest of the city of Amsterdam (initial n = 508). Health measures include general health, health in comparison with age peers, functional limitations, disability and cognitive functioning. These measures are based on self-ratings, interviewer observations, or both. Results: Older persons living closest to the disaster area are likely to experience health decline in the wake of a disaster, over and above the health decline that would occur normally with aging. The disaster-associated health decline is small, and most obvious in the ability to perform actions (such as mobility), but is not observed in either disability in daily functioning, nor in self-perceptions of health. Cognitive functioning even shows a short-term improvement. Conclusion: These findings suggest substantial resilience in older adults, despite their common health problems. © The Author 2005.

Cross-campus collaborations with UNO's world-renowned aerospace program provide the students with many experiential learning opportunities that satisfy EAC/ABET EC2000 design, multidisciplinary teamwork, and communication skill outcomes. Examples of ongoing systems engineering projects include AEROCam, a multispectral imager designed for flight in UND Aviation small aircraft; AgCam, a two-band imaging sensor to be installed in the International Space Station for capturing precision agriculture data; and a radio-controlled Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with a three-meter wingspan, capable of flying four-kilogram scientific payloads. A major benefit of working on these multidisciplinary projects is that the students must learn to communicate well in order to be successful on a large team, which is virtually impossible to teach without some form of experiential learning opportunity. Undergraduates who excel at designing complex electrical subsystems must also understand the importance of the integration and test process when building a much larger system containing electrical, mechanical, and software components. From a ""real world"" perspective, these projects provide the same technical challenges, team environment, personality conflicts, and ever-changing workforce as industry. Briefcase studies will be provided for these three systems engineering projects, as well as several other projects initiated at the University of North Dakota. Judging by the success of recent UND B.S.E.E. graduates working as systems engineers, the Aerospace Focus program has been a worthwhile endeavor, but it requires an enormous amount of faculty energy."
"Advancing circadian rhythms before eastward flight: A strategy to prevent or reduce jet lag","2005","Sleep","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17244378201&partnerID=40&md5=47c40c1181e7301bae61328b4bc6139f","Study Objectives: To develop a practical pre-eastward flight treatment to advance circadian rhythms as much as possible but not misalign them with sleep. Design: One group had their sleep schedule advanced by 1 hour per day and another by 2 hours per day. Setting: Baseline at home, treatment in lab. Participants: Young healthy adults (11 men, 15 women) between the ages of 22 and 36 years. Interventions: Three days of a gradually advancing sleep schedule (1 or 2 hours per day) plus intermittent morning bright light (one-half hour -5000 lux, one-half hour of < 60 lux) for 3.5 hours. Measurements and Results: The dim light melatonin onset was assessed before and after the 3-day treatment. Subjects completed daily sleep logs and symptom questionnaires and wore wrist activity monitors. The dim light melatonin onset advanced more in the 2-hours-per-day group than in the 1-hour-per-day group (median phase advances of 1.9 and 1.4 hours), but the difference between the means (1.8 and 1.5 hours) was not statistically significant. By the third treatment day, circadian rhythms were misaligned relative to the sleep schedule, and subjects had difficulty falling asleep in the 2-hours-per-day group, but this was not the case in the 1-hour-per-day group. Nevertheless, the 2-hours-per-day group did slightly better on the symptom questionnaires. In general, sleep disturbance and other side effects were small. Conclusions: A gradually advancing sleep schedule with intermittent morning bright light can be used to advance circadian rhythms before eastward flight and, thus, theoretically, prevent or reduce subsequent jet lag. Given the morning light treatment used here, advancing the sleep schedule 2 hours per day is not better than advancing it 1 hour per day because it was too fast for the advance in circadian rhythms.

In the early 1920s Brigadier General William ""Billy"" Mitchell and a group of Army Air Service officers tried to force the creation of an independent air force against presidential wishes. They forged political alliances, used propaganda to arouse public sentiment, and circumvented their superiors to appeal directly to congressmen. Mitchell, a flamboyant, popular, and powerful personality, led these efforts and was ultimately court-martialed. Following Mitchell, aviation leaders were careful to avoid distressing presidents, Congresses, and an American public upset at Mitchell's challenges to civilian control. Tensions persisted, however, and the Air Corps took another step backward when Major General Benjamin Foulois misled Congress and the president and revived the image of the Air Corps as a radical element. Not until Major Generals Oscar Westover and ""Hap"" Arnold, a former radical himself, abandoned the crusade for immediate independence and emphasized cooperation within the Army and with civilian authorities did the Air Corps develop a stable and cooperative relationship with the president and Congress. Rondall R. Rice demonstrates that during the interwar period, civil-military relations between Army aviation leaders and civilian officials developed unevenly from confrontation to cooperation. © 2004 by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

A review of the aviation literature highlights the significance of Human Factors and its relevance to the recruitment and training of ab initio pilots. However, research in the field is criticized for failing to account for existing power relations and the potential effects of a new discursive format. This article uses the concept of discourse associated with Michel Foucault to analyse empirical data from interviews wilh individuals involved in ab initio pilot training at a European flying college. The analysis illustrates how staff at the training college use the rhetoric of Human Factors to enhance their own contribution and status, without fundamentally changing existing practices. Although this reinforces existing power relations, the Human Factors discourse also potentially empowers a different set of management employees. By illustrating the conflicting values and interests of two sets of managers and trainers at the college, the article is able to demonstrate the negative effects of the new discursive format on male ab initio pilots. It also discusses attitudes to female pilots, contributing to the debate about the ability of management discourses to promote gender equality within commercial organizations. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004."

Communication failures are an extremely common cause of inadvertent patient harm. The complexity of medical care, coupled with the inherent limitations of human performance, make it critically important that clinicians have standardised communication tools, create an environment in which individuals can speak up and express concerns, and share common ""critical language"" to alert team members to unsafe situations. All too frequently, effective communication is situation or personality dependent. Other high reliability domains, such as commercial aviation, have shown that the adoption of standardised tools and behaviours is a very effective strategy in enhancing teamwork and reducing risk. We describe our ongoing patient safety implementation using this approach within Kaiser Permanente, a non-profit American healthcare system providing care for 8.3 million patients. We describe specific clinical experience in the application of surgical briefings, properties of high reliability perinatal care, the value of critical event training and simulation, and benefits of a standardised communication process in the care of patients transferred from hospitals to skilled nursing facilities. Additionally, lessons learned as to effective techniques in achieving cultural change, evidence of improving the quality of the work environment, practice transfer strategies, critical success factors, and the evolving methods of demonstrating the benefit of such work are described."

Moreover, corporate aviation departments and commercial air carriers have vested interests in hiring those applicants who have the propensity to perform effectively in a team environment. As a continuation of ongoing research in pilot resource selection, the authors have examined the efficacy of binary logistic regression in screening candidates for instructor pilot upgrade by analyzing psychological surveys of 77 commercial pilots based on the Big Five Personality Inventory, the Leadership Intelligence Quotient (LIQ) Self-Assessment and three select attribute scales (Mach V, locus-of-control, and self-monitoring scales). Results of this research indicated a significant relationship between leader decision-making and personality attributes complementing team formation. In this particular study, 36 experienced instructor pilots and 41 line pilots were categorized with an overall accuracy of 93 percent employing a two-variable model based on Machiavellian view and self-monitoring as independent or predictor variables. These results underscored the efficacy of logistic regression as a statistical methodology in human resource selection and these psychological dimensions as a means of screening pilot candidates for program assignment. The demand among commercial air carriers and corporate aviation for greater consistency and validity of aircrew resource selection methods grows continuously. In the past, the emphasis has been on evaluating technical qualifications and operational experience. There has been no shortage of applicants meeting the basic standard in these areas. The challenge today and in the future is to go beyond that stage of evaluation to develop more effective means of measuring the social aspects of the human variable in the aviation safety equation. Selection protocols are under close, continuous scrutiny and now include personality and temperament characteristics related to crew coordination and team assimilation (Chidester, 1991). Research suggested that in the past selection protocols have suffered in predictive validity with content remaining basically unchanged (Damos, 1995). These protocols in the past have indicated higher predictive validity in the training program, not in the operational environment (Damos, 1996). Effective screening of pilot candidates, whether the purpose is to identify instructor upgrades or to select hires, will improve the return on investment of sunk costs related to training (Hackman, 1993). © 2004, FAA Academy."

In Norway, the Aeromedical Section of the Civil Aviation Authority assesses whether pilots are medically fit to fly. This study presents the reasons for medical disqualification among the Norwegian commercial pilot population during a 20-yr period. Methods: Files on all disqualified commercial pilots were reviewed and subdivided into age groups and diagnostic categories. Different disqualification rates were calculated. Results: From the study population of 48,229 pilot-years, 275 pilots were permanently grounded, which gives a 20-yr average disqualification rate of 5.7 per 1,000 pilot-years. Discussion and Conclusions: For cardiovascular diseases the disqualification rate was lower after 1997 than before, which is explained by improved treatment and more lenient requirements. In the diagnostic categories, neurology, musculoskeletal, and psychiatric diseases, the disqualification rate increased after 1997. This fact is probably not attributed to more stringent health requirements, but possibly to the attitudes of the pilots, who have become more critical with respect to their subjective perception of their working environment and psychosocial factors."

Method: Exposed disaster workers (N= 207) and unexposed comparison subjects (N=421) were examined at 2, 7, and 13 months after an airplane crash. Results: Exposed disaster workers had significantly higher rates of acute stress disorder, PTSD at 13 months, depression at 7 months, and depression at 13 months than comparison subjects. Those who were younger and single were more likely to develop acute stress disorder. Exposed disaster workers with acute stress disorder were 3.93 times more likely to be depressed at 7 months. Those with high exposure and previous disaster experience or who had acute stress disorder were more likely to develop PTSD. Similarly, those who were depressed at 7 months were 9.5 times more likely to have PTSD. Those who were depressed at 13 months were 7.96 times more likely to also meet PTSD criteria. More exposed disaster workers than comparison subjects obtained medical care for emotional problems at 2, 7, and 13 months. Overall, 40.5% of exposed disaster workers versus 20.4% of comparison subjects had acute stress disorder, depression at 13 months, or PTSD. Conclusions: Exposed disaster workers are at increased risk of acute stress disorder, depression, or PTSD and seek care for emotional problems at an increased rate."

The aftermath of this incident showed that psychological and physical health problems can still occur many years later. The main failure of the aftercare of the Bijlmer disaster lay in the coordination of aid and the monitoring of health problems. In Enschede steps were taken to redress these problems. An information and advice centre (IAC) was set up to monitor the well-being of the victims, and to provide them with information and, where necessary, assistance. It is responsible for limiting the effects of the disaster. A total of 13,000 people have consulted the IAC. A residents' association was formed. This gave the victims a common voice during the process of attempting to restore normality in their lives. A specialized mental health-care unit was founded to treat disaster-related disorders using evidence-based treatments. So far approximately 1,300 people have consulted this body. A longitudinal study has been set up to map the consequences of the disaster and to advise aid organizations. This will also give information on the extent to which these methods have been able to limit the long-term consequences."
"Why people 'freeze' in an emergency: Temporal and cognitive constraints on survival responses","2004","Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2442684235&partnerID=40&md5=1195b5bcf1a8fa7e55a42e27945c2826","Background: Many witnesses attest that victims of a disaster often perish despite reasonable possibilities for escaping because their behavior during the initial moments of the accident was inappropriate to the situation. Frequently witnesses report victims 'freezing' in the face of danger. Objective: The aim of this paper was to identify the possible factors underpinning 'freezing' behavior in disaster victims. Methods. Witness testimonies, survivor debriefings, and official inquiry reports from shipwreck and aircraft emergencies were analyzed for their behavioral content. Results: It was found that 'freezing' behavior was a frequently cited response by witnesses to a disaster. 'Freezing' causes evacuation delays which increase the danger, establishing a closed loop process and further extending evacuation delays. This behavior can be accounted for by considering the temporal constraints on cognitive information processing in a rapidly unfolding, real-time environment. Conclusion: Cognitive limitations help to explain why survival training works and why there is a need for a survival culture to be developed. They also highlight the need to understand the behavior of children under threat as being different from that of adults due to the different stages of their neurological and cognitive development. There are implications for the development of proactive, rather than passive, life support equipment."

Observers participated in five sessions of a task requiring them to search for knives hidden in x-ray images of cluttered bags. Sensitivity and response times improved reliably as a result of practice. Eye movement data revealed that sensitivity increases were produced entirely by changes in observers' ability to recognize target objects, and not by changes in the effectiveness of visual scanning. Moreover, recognition skills were in part stimulus-specific, such that performance was degraded by the introduction of unfamiliar target objects. Implications for screener training are discussed."

Methods: Qualitative study in which 26 current and former women flight attendants participated: three focus groups of 6-7 participants each and six in-depth individual interviews. The session themes included positive and negative aspects of the job; relationships with colleagues, superiors, and passengers; perception of occupational risk for serious diseases; compatibility of work and family; and experiences of work related sources of stress and their effect on health. A transcript based analysis of the focus groups and interviews was used to identify emerging themes related to risk factors for mental health problems. Results: The participants indicated that mental health was a major concern. Several work related risk factors possibly related to adverse outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, were highlighted. These included isolation and solitude, fears of being inadequate partners and mothers due to job demands, passenger relationships, and lack of protection by employers with respect to workplace exposures and violent passengers. The information gained was used to develop a mental health module for inclusion in the health survey questionnaire which included questions on history of severe depression or anxiety, suicidal ideation or attempt, substance abuse, workplace sexual harassment, social support, leisure time activities, relationship with a partner, and role as mother. Conclusions: Employing qualitative methods to identify work related sources of psychosocial stress enabled development of pertinent questionnaire items for a cross-sectional epidemiological study of women flight attendants. Follow up qualitative research may be necessary in order to put the cross-sectional study findings into context and to explore actions or strategies for preventing work related health problems evidenced from the survey."

Unlike major air carriers, air tour operators are not required by law to develop plans for dealing with fatal accidents and many do not have one. When a tour operator without advance planning and preparation experiences a fatal crash, the result is often chaos.

The consequences dominate the risk profiles for nuclear power and for many other technologies. We need to quantify the probability of human error for the system as an integral contribution within the overall system failure, as it is generally not separable or predictable for actual events. We also need to provide a means to manage and effectively reduce the failure (error) rate. The fact that humans learn from their mistakes allows a new determination of the dynamic probability and human failure (error) rate in technological systems. The result is consistent with and derived from the available world data for modern technological systems. Comparisons are made to actual data from large technological systems and recent catastrophes. Best estimate values and relationships can be derived for both the human error rate, and for the probability. We describe the potential for new approaches to the management of human error and safety indicators, based on the principles of error state exclusion and of the systematic effect of learning."

In addition to personality, various levels of flight difficulty are considered in order to investigate their potential interaction effect in terms of student pilots' mental workload measured in heart rate, altitude deviation, NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) and subjective degree of personality harmony. Based on an experiment performed in a real flight situation, we found significant effects of personality combinations in terms of all four outcome measures. Both group C types of instructors and students who are concrete, realistic and have mechanical skills turn out to be the ideal flight crew combination. A structural equation model, fitted to analyse causality among the four response variables, implied that as the heart rate increased, the altitude deviation increased. In addition, as the altitude deviation and personality harmony increased, NASA-TLX increased. The results of this study are expected to provide a theoretical basis for manning the flight crew combinations and thereby enhancing the efficiency of flight training."

Degraded states of operator functioning can lead to errors and overall suboptimal system performance. Accurate assessment of operator functional state is crucial to the successful implementation of an adaptive aiding system. One method of determining operators' functional state is by monitoring their physiology. In the present study, artificial neural networks using physiological signals were used to continuously monitor, in real time, the functional state of 7 participants while they performed the Multi-Attribute Task Battery with two levels of task difficulty. Six channels of brain electrical activity and eye, heart and respiration measures were evaluated on line. The accuracy of the classifier was determined to test its utility as an on-line measure of operator state. The mean classification accuracies were 85%, 82%, and 86% for the baseline, low task difficulty, and high task difficulty conditions, respectively. The high levels of accuracy suggest that these procedures can be used to provide accurate estimates of operator functional state that can be used to provide adaptive aiding.

New concepts implemented with a view to increasing capacity and efficiency should at least be safety-neutral. Because of the enormous impact of the introduction of new air traffic management systems, their basic concepts have to be evaluated prospectively. With the increasing automation during the nineties, the concept of situation awareness (SA) became accepted as a potential indicator for safety. Among the considerable number of methods that have been developed to measure SA, no method has been validated or applied to evaluate future ATM-concepts like the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The approach of SAGAT is based on the assumption that the set of task environments' elements that are relevant for SA is independent of the dynamics within the task environment. Empirical evidence was found that this assumption can not be held in the ATC-domain. A new method to measure SA in ATC, called SALSA, has been developed. This measure takes into account that air traffic controllers use an event based mental representation of the air traffic. The SALSA and the SAGAT SA-measure have been compared in an evaluation study of a new ATM-concept. Results indicate that the method SALSA is feasible and more suitable than SAGAT to evaluate prospectively future ATM-concepts with regards to their impact on safety. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

First we explored the impact of deliberate practice on pilot decision-making performance for crisis flying scenarios that had been practiced in their entirety. Then we looked at the impact of deliberate practice in which one aspect of the crisis scenario - the particular malfunction - was unpracticed. We analyzed pilot decision-making performance in response to 160 airborne mechanical malfunctions. We initially found that deliberate practice significantly improves decision-making performance for wholly practiced crises but does not improve decision-making performance when the specific malfunction has not been practiced. We then split decision making for each crisis into two phases: assessment and action selection. For wholly practiced crisis scenarios, additional deliberate practice positively impacts each decision-making phase. However, for part-practiced scenarios, deliberate practice appears to differentially affect phase of error. Specifically, pilots with more deliberate practice erred in action selection, whereas less-practiced pilots erred in assessment.

Data from 7 air traffic controllers were used to train and test artificial neural network and stepwise discriminant classifiers. Very high levels of classification accuracy were achieved by both classifiers. When the 2 task difficulty manipulations were tested separately, the percentage correct classifications were between 84% and 88%. Feature reduction using saliency analysis for the artificial neural networks resulted in a mean of 90% correct classification accuracy. Considering the data as a 2-class problem, acceptable load versus overload, resulted in almost perfect classification accuracies, with mean percentage correct of 98%. In applied situations, the most important distinction among operator functional states would be to detect mental overload situations.

The aim of the study presented is to introduce Rasmussen's model of human behavior as a practical framework for the definition of the training objectives, needs, and means in MIS. Methods: Rasmussen distinguishes three levels of human behavior: skill-, rule-, and knowledge-based behaviour. The training needs of a laparoscopic novice can be determined by identifying the specific skill-, rule-, and knowledge-based behavior that is required for performing safe laparoscopy. Future objectives of VR laparoscopy trainers should address all three levels of behavior. Results: Although most commercially available simulators for laparoscopy aim at training skill-based behavior, especially the training of knowledge-based behavior during complications in surgery will improve safety levels. However, the cost and complexity of a training means increases when the training objectives proceed from the training of skill-based behavior to the training of complex knowledge-based behavior. Conclusion: In aviation, human behavior models have been used successfully to integrate the training of skill-, rule-, and knowledge-based behavior in a full flight simulator. Understanding surgeon behavior is one of the first steps towards a future full-scale laparoscopy simulator."

Summary Background Data: Powerful conceptual advances have been made in understanding the nature and limits of human performance. Applying these findings in high-risk activities, such as commercial aviation, has allowed the work environment to be restructured to substantially reduce human error. Methods: The authors analyzed 252 laparoscopic bile duct injuries according to the principles of the cognitive science of visual perception, judgment, and human error. The injury distribution was class I, 7%; class II, 22%; class III, 61%; and class IV, 10%. The data included operative radiographs, clinical records, and 22 videotapes of original operations. Results: The primary cause of error in 97% of cases was a visual perceptual illusion. Faults in technical skill were present in only 3% of injuries, Knowledge and judgment errors were contributory but not primary. Sixty-four injuries (25%) were recognized at the index operation; the surgeon identified the problem early enough to limit the injury in only 15 (6%). In class III injuries the common duct, erroneously believed to be the cystic duct, was deliberately cut. This stemmed from an illusion of object form due to a specific uncommon configuration of the structures and the heuristic nature (unconscious assumptions) of human visual perception. The videotapes showed the persuasiveness of the illusion, and many operative reports described the operation as routine. Class II injuries resulted from a dissection too close to the common hepatic duct. Fundamentally an illusion, it was contributed to in some instances by working too deep in the triangle of Calot. Conclusions: These data show that errors leading to laparoscopic bile duct injuries stem principally from misperception, not errors of skill, knowledge, or judgment. The misperception was so compelling that in most cases the surgeon did not recognize a problem. Even when irregularities were identified, corrective feedback did not occur, which is characteristic of human thinking under firmly held assumptions. These findings illustrate the complexity of human error in surgery while simultaneously providing insights. They demonstrate that automatically attributing technical complications to behavioral factors that rely on the assumption of control is likely to be wrong. Finally, this study shows that there are only a few points within laparoscopic cholecystectomy where the complication-causing errors occur, which suggests that focused training to heighten vigilance might be able to decrease the incidence of bile duct injury."

In this aviation education application of A-l theory, it was found that aircraft pilots and pilot trainees had a distinct cognitive style preference in that they were a fairly adaptive group when compared to population norms. This fact has implications for curricular design which are discussed herein. © 2003, FAA Academy."

From his forty-four years of pilot experience and thirty-one years as a professor of psychology and human factors engineering, Jeff Koonce addresses the questions of how to apply sound human factors principles to the training of pilots and to one’s personal flying. He takes a positive approach to the subject, emphasising safety and good practice. While problem areas are acknowledged, and the book points out how certain problems may result in mishaps, it avoids focusing on individual accidents. This is equally useful for the pilot wanting to make a systematic study of the human factors issues behind safe flying, as for the instructor or serious student needing an authoritative text. © 2002 Jefferson M.

The members were drawn from airport and airline sectors, regulators as well as aircraft manufacturers, and were tasked with writing a report on their vision for the future direction of European Aeronautical research. One of the important goals mentioned in the report: ""European Aeronautics: A Vision for 2020"", is to have a European ATM system that can handle 16 million flights per year with 24-hour operation of airports and a more flexible and efficient use of European airspace. In the last decade a lot of ATM research, both in Europe and the US, has explored the application of distributed decision making and autonomous aircraft operations. Initially, the goal of this research, as defined in 1994 by the RTCA, was to increase flight efficiency in terms of fuel and time. As one of the pioneers, the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR in co-operation with NASA and the FAA, investigated the boundaries of the new concept of Free Flight with airborne separation assurance. A prototype airborne separation assurance system was tested in current and higher simulated en-route traffic densities. Surprisingly, the system was able to handle all simulated traffic densities, even the extremely high ones. At the same time the Vision 2020 report was published by the Group of Personalities expressing the need for higher airspace capacity. The NLR research results suggested that airborne separation assurance could not only increase fuel and time efficiency, but also dramatically increase en-route airspace capacity. These results have been confirmed by various international research projects. The envisioned end-state, after implementation of Free Flight, implies a role change of Air Traffic Control towards Air Traffic Management. This paper will not only describe this possible end-state and its benefits but also discuss the various paths to reach it. © 2003 by National Aerospace Laboratory, the Netherlands.

Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) has been applied in various domains such as medicine, aviation and military to help analysts develop an in-depth understanding of complex socio-technical systems. CWA may open up a new era for computer scientists who wish to model complex environments where human behaviours are the core elements. Conventional heuristics and reasoning algorithms fail at a point where uncertainties must be included in the simulated human decision-making processors. In order to achieve realism, it is important for such processors to be able to choose the most viable course of action after generating several plans that allow for uncertainty in the domain. Each plan can either be equally weighted, ranked with different importance level or ranked according to personality types (eg. high risk or conservative personalities). In this paper, our aim is to show what information should be fused from the cognitive model which is integrated into a BDI (Believe, Desires and Intention) intelligent agent framework, JACKm. In our case, we are modelling the command & control (C2) and decision-making of a company commander in the battlefield. A mechanised infantry, company attack scenario is used as a case study to demonstrate the functionality and capability of the intelligent agents. © 2003 ISlF."

However, on nearly every personality factor a significant difference was found between the general population norms and the sample of Pilot Incumbents and Applicants. The Pilot Incumbent/Applicant group scored significantly more intelligent, emotionally stable, and mature in comparison to the general population norms. We believe that it is the high-risk nature of this occupation that leads applicants, wishing to pursue this field, to assess very carefully their own person-job fit and self-select themselves, thus ultimately producing this very distinct ""pilot personality profile"" described in 1995 by Bartram."

Although therapeutic levels for most drugs are typically reported in the scientific literature for blood and plasma, blood specimens are received in only approximately 70% of our cases. Therefore, it is imperative for an accident investigator and forensic toxicologist to be able to estimate drug concentrations in an aviation accident victim's blood from available tissue drug concentrations. This is exemplified by a recent aviation fatality in which butalbital was identified in the muscle tissue of a pilot. In this case, no blood was available for analysis, but investigators needed to know the approximate butalbital concentration expected in the victim's blood. Certain side effects of butalbital, such as drowsiness, sedation, dizziness, and a feeling of intoxication, could affect pilot performance and become a significant factor in an aviation accident. Thus, our laboratory determined the distribution of butalbital in various postmortem tissues and fluids. The distribution coefficients for butalbital, expressed as specimen/blood ratios, were found to be as follows: 0.66 ± 0.09 (muscle, n = 4), 0.98 ± 0.09 (kidney, n = 4), 0.87 ± 0.06 (lung, n = 4), 0.75 ± 0.03 (spleen, n = 4), 0.96 ± 0.07 (brain, n = 3), 2.22 ± 0.04 (liver, n = 4), and 0.91 ± 0.17 (heart, n = 2). The results obtained from our limited number of cases suggest that muscle, kidney, lung, spleen, brain, liver, and heart could be used, in a cautious and conservative fashion, to estimate butalbital blood concentrations."

The primary objective is aviation safety. According to David McKenas, Corporate Medical Director for American Airlines, ""The bottom line for us, through an individualized, case-by-case assessment, is to determine whether or not an individual poses a significant safety risk in the performance of pilot duties [relative to] a normal commercial airline population . . . Significant safety risk is the key criterion."" A second objective is to return air crew personnel back to flight status as quickly as possible. The livelihood of the pilot or other air crew personnel depends upon the outcome of the evaluation and the specific recommendations made by the psychologist, neuropsychologist, or psychiatrist providing examinations. CogScreen has proven beneficial in facilitating the return of military pilots to active flying status. Recently, a commercial pilot who sustained a head injury was permitted to return to duty sooner than was previously possible, after he was able to demonstrate that he had returned to his baseline level of CogScreen performance. Emphasis has been made on having only qualified examiners provide psychological examination of air crew personnel. Psychologists and psychiatrists who provide these services must have knowledge of the cognitive, psychomotor, perceptual, and interpersonal demands of the pilot's job. Familiarity with the aviator personality type is highly recommended. Additionally, psychologists providing these evaluations should have expertise with the psychological and neuropsychological tests that provide a sensitive measure of the abilities required for aviation performance. They should be capable of interpreting test results relative to either baseline testing (where it exists) or relative to aviator norms. If aviator norms are unavailable, the results should be interpreted relative to appropriate age and education norms for the general population. In addition, examiners providing these services must be able to effectively and clearly communicate the findings of the evaluation. This involves describing the examinee's current level of functioning across the cognitive, perceptual, motor, and interpersonal ability domains required for job performance. The normative data used to interpret test results should be specified. Similarly, the sources of collateral information used in developing the report should be specified. The report should provide recommendations for use by the ultimate decision maker (i.e., FAA, airline). In addition, the ""raw"" (unstandardized) test scores should be included with the report to facilitate review of the results by FAA or airline consultants. The evaluator should avoid presentation of the results in a biased manner. In reporting the results of the evaluation the examiner must provide an objective, dispassionate, and comprehensive assessment, taking into consideration all of the information provided: test results, interview results, and review of medical and employment records. The psychological evaluation of air crew personnel is a critical component of aviation safety. The flying public and the airlines rely upon the providers of these examinations to assess the suitability and well-being of the air crew who are responsible for the lives of hundreds if not thousands of individuals."

Pilots were directly affected by these events though it is too early to comprehend the specific psychological and occupational repercussions. While psychologists have written much on the selection of commercial and military aircrew, surprisingly little has been published on the mental health of pilots. They are a unique occupational group in terms of their selection, training, lifestyle, frequent competency and medical checks, as well as the nature and changing demands placed on them. Their 'office' is normally a cramped flight deck on board an aircraft at altitudes of thousands of feet. While some aspects of their job and lifestyle appear attractive to some, their working conditions are, at worst, inhospitable and unpleasant. This paper provides an overview of current research on the mental health of pilots, gathered from a number of different fields and specialities within commercial and military aviation. The review covers their lifestyle, psychological requirements for medical certification, psychological problems amongst air crew, personality factors, disruption to personal relationships, reactions to incidents and accidents, alcohol and drug misuse, suicide by aircraft and environmental challenges. Flight crew should have easy access to psychological support; however, many pilots are distrusting of mental health professionals. Further research is needed to improve an understanding of mental health issues among pilots, especially in order to better understand the psychological impact of the terrorist attacks upon them."

The time lags between critical variabtes require prediction in an uncertain World. The interrelated concepts of situation awareness and workload are central to aviation psychology. Three components of situation awareness are spatial awareness, system awareness, and task awareness. Each of these components has real-world implications, spatial awareness for instrument displays, system awareness for keeping the operator informed about actions that have been taken by automated systems, and task awareness for attention and task management. Task management is directly related to mental workload, as the competing demands of tasks for attention exceed the operator's limited resources."

The relationship of chronological age to self-rated changes in cognition has been studied extensively. However, the relationship of these changes to age-related changes in piloting skills is not well understood. Objective: This study aims to determine whether airline pilots report age-related changes in cognitive abilities, and whether these changes are related to self-rated changes in piloting skills. Methods: A total of 1310 airline pilots (28-59 yr, mean age = 45.5 yr; mean total flight time = 11,992 h) currently employed by a major U.S. commercial air carrier participated in the study. A 13-item Aviation Experience Survey (AES) was completed by each pilot, using 5-point Likert ratings and yes/no responses comparing current cognitive abilities (e.g., concentration, reaction speed) and piloting skills (e.g., piloting in adverse weather, decision making while flying) with those of 10 yr ago. Results: Cognitive abilities and piloting skills were more likely to be rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" than 10 yr ago by pilots age 39 or under than by pilots in their 40s and 50s, who were more likely to rate their abilities and skills as ""the same."" Fewer than 20% of pilots in any age group rated their cognitive abilities or piloting skills as ""worse"" or ""much worse"" than 10 yr ago. Pilots who reported more anxiety or stress while flying reported more negative changes in abilities, skills, and health status regardless of age. Conclusions: Self-ratings of cognition and piloting skills vary by age, but older pilots are not more likely to report negative changes in their abilities and skills than younger pilots. Further research is needed to verify whether these self-appraisals reflect true changes in skills over time."

There are few studies, however, of the normal physiological response to virtual environments or reactions to different virtual environments. The goal of this study is to analyze nonphobic participants' physiological reactions to two virtual environments: driving and flying. Eleven nonphobic participants were exposed to each virtual environment for 15 min. Heart rate, skin resistance, and skin temperature were measured during physiological monitoring, and the Presence and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores were obtained after each exposure. This study found that skin resistance and heart rate variability can be used to show arousal of participants exposed to the virtual environment experience and that such measures generally returned to normal over time. The data suggest that skin resistance and heart rate can be used as objective measures in monitoring the reaction of non-phobic participants to virtual environments. We also noted that heart rate variability could be useful for assessing the emotional states of participants."

If the actual system behavior and the operator's 'mental model' are both described as finite state transition systems, then mechanized techniques known as 'model checking' can be used automatically to discover any scenarios that cause the behaviors of the two descriptions to diverge from one another. These scenarios identify potential surprises and pinpoint areas where design changes, or revisions to training materials or procedures, should be considered. The mental models can be suggested by human factors experts, or can be derived from training materials, or can express simple requirements for 'consistent' behavior. The approach is demonstrated by applying the Murø state exploration system to a 'kill-the-capture' surprise in the MD-88 autopilot. This approach does not supplant the contributions of those working in human factors and aviation psychology, but rather provides them with a tool to examine properties of their models using mechanized calculation. These calculations can be used to explore the consequences of alternative designs and cues, and of systematic operator error, and to assess the cognitive complexity of designs. The description of model checking is tutorial and is hoped to be accessible to those from the human factors community to whom this technology may be new. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd."

The notion is used intuitively in the pertinent literature, but with surprisingly different meanings. We present a rigorous way of modelling the human and the machine in a shared-control system. This enables us to propose a precise definition of “mode” and “mode confusion”. In our modelling approach, we extend the commonly used distinction between the machine and the user’s mental model of it by explicitly separating these and their safety-relevant abstractions. Furthermore, we show that distinguishing three different interfaces during the design phase reduces the potential for mode confusion. A result is a new classification of mode confusions by cause, leading to a number of design recommendations for shared-control systems which helpto avoid mode confusion problems. A further result is a foundation for detecting mode confusion problems by model checking. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002."

Nowadays, the designer can choose among a great variety of models, e.g., behavioural models and competence models, and these models are available in a large range of granularity from quasineuropsychological models of memory to framework models of dynamic cognition. However, despite -or maybe because of- the variety of models, modelling the operator is still a land of contrasts within the industry, with multiple forms and meanings, and as result a feeling persists that these models, which are meant to be useful, are difficult to incorporate into the design process or the operations. This conference focuses on the development and use of cognitive models of human reliability, and tries to understand the biases and limitations of their use in design of safe systems within the industry. It is divided into three sections. The first section details the range of existing cognitive models of human reliability and proposes a classification of these models into four main categories: error production models, error detection and recovery models, systemic models, and integrated safety ecological models. The example of the Aviation Industry shows how difficult it has been in the recent past to incorporate the most advanced of these models into design, even though the same Industry has long complained that such cognitive operators' models were not available. The second section tries to explain the reason for the relative failure. It shows the inter-dependency existing between the category of cognitive model, the safety paradigm, and the strategy for design. Severe drawbacks may occur each time a model is used with the wrong safety paradigm or the wrong strategy for design. It also shows that the more cognitively-based the model is, the less it is incorporated into design. The lack of education in psychology for designers, as well as the lack of a clear procedure for incorporating such models into design, are among the most important factors explaining this lack of success. The third and last section points to the new directions in cognitive modelling to improve the fit between operator modelling and design requirements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002."

Data indicate that sensor fusion did not improve performance relative to that obtained with single-band imagery on a target detection task but did facilitate object recognition, judgments of spatial orientation, and scene recognition. Observers' recognition and orientation judgments were improved by the emergent information within the image-fused imagery (i.e., combining dominant information from two or more sensors into a single displayed image).

Having answered the Norwegian translation of the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised, a group of 75 students, 56 (five women) military aviation cadets and 19 (10 women) graduate students, received a random T-score profile and were asked to rate their agreement on a 7-point scale. For all personality traits, i.e., facets and domains measured by the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised, positive correlations ranging from .08 to .64 were found between the agreement ratings and the similarity between the random false scores and the actual scores. The respondents identified and rejected random T scores that deviated far from their actual scores, which works against the Barnum effect. Correct identification correlated negatively with Neuroticism (r = -.41) and positively (r = .53) with Conscientiousness."

Method: The Armstrong Laboratory Aviator Personality Survey (ALAPS) was administered to 312 designated naval aviators and flight officers from a variety of aircraft communities. The sample included O-3/O-4 elite aviators who were selected for their squadron billets based on superior performance, O-5/O-6 aviators selected for command positions, and 59 flag officers. Results: The junior aviators scored higher on the factor associated with Dogmatism and lower on the factor associated with Team Orientation and Socialness. This pattern was reversed for the flag officers, while O-5/O-6 aviators received intermediate scores on each of these factors. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates a correlation between specific ALAPS factors and experience, rank, age, and flight time. The combination of high Dogmatism, low Team Orientation, and low Socialness in junior aviators could suggest lower openness to crew input and increased risk for mishaps."

While the authorities' management of the emergency created by the initial crash was effective, the long-term crisis management performance was considerably less effective. It is argued that, particularly in hazardous materials emergencies, considerable management attention is required in the long-term aftermath rather than seeking a quick declaration of ""all clear"" or determination that the crisis is over. This paper examines the roles of all actors in the crisis and addresses the nature of communications in the ""disaster after the disaster"". The evolution of a ""toxic fear"" among citizens is documented and the social psychology of crisis management in the aftermath is examined. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

The few available data are scattered and frequently anecdotal. Methods: The authors reviewed all case reports of fliers evaluated at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine's Aeromedical Consultation Service (ACS) between 1981-96 for possible return to flying duties after a suicide attempt, and prepared a representative case report. Results: Between 1981 and 1996, the ACS evaluated 14 trained aviators (pilots and other aircrew members, excluding flight surgeons) who had attempted suicide. Of these, 11 (79%) ultimately received a recommendation for return to flying duties. Conclusions: In most instances the underlying stressors included failed intimate interpersonal relationships, administrative or legal problems, psychiatric disorders, death of spouse, or job conflicts. Evidence of abuse of alcohol or other substances was found in 54% of an earlier, larger data set of attempters. Some data on aircrew suicide completion were available and are reported. The top medical priorities after such attempts should be to diagnose what is wrong, and to treat it. In spite of the common assumption that a suicide attempt inevitably ends a military flying career, some attempters can return to safe and effective flying duty after appropriate psychotherapy. If the flier regains physical and mental health and maintains them for at least 6 mo after treatment, then that flier may be evaluated by an outside aeromedical psychiatric consultant such as the ACS (to avoid transference issues between flier and therapist) for possible return to flying duties. Waiver action should be based on the underlying psychiatric diagnosis, not the suicidal attempt itself. Follow-up may be accomplished through periodic mental health evaluations in conjunction with routine physical examination procedures. Issues involving substance abuse and security clearances must be handled through the appropriate channels."

Team personality compositions (average levels and diversity), based on the five factor model (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), were compared for high- and low-performing teams. Results supported the hypothesis that high-performing teams would exhibit higher mean levels of extraversion than low-performing teams, but did not support predictions related to neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and team personality diversity.

There are deviations between 3.7 and 45.8 in hospital stay. They have Mortality between 4.9 and 5.6. From those between, a 51% and a 54% can be avoided. Only a 27% can be considered as negligence. Deviations happen only a few times because of an isolated personal human factor, but they are associated with many different ocassional and underlying reasons. The analysis of those reasons is essential to understand and to help preventing repetition of that facts. Adverse events does not in many cases mean a training failure but an error in the way that a physician act at a certain moment. The cognitive psychology tries to explain the way that memory behaves, reasoning, and human performance. Adverse events could be not so often, if all the efforts could be driven in direction of prevention, and not in direction of legal punishment. The industry have a lot of experience in applying norms, which could be adapted to any sanitary system, as it is shown in civil aviation industry. All the sanitary personnel should collaborate and this is fundamental to know the facts and the circumstances. However it requires confidentiality and absence of retaliation. It is a fact that there are deviations and its importance requires a cultural change to transform a traditionally defensive attitude into a collaborating conduct in order to improve the quality of the attendance."

To investigate the influence of an aircraft crash near the South of Limburg, the Netherlands, on the perceived physical and psychological health and annoyance of local residents. Design. Controlled, blinded, follow-up questionnaire survey. Method. Three months before an aircraft crash occurred, randomly selected local residents and control subjects who lived approximately 20 km from the crash site were asked to complete a health questionnaire. The study was repeated one year after the crash. The aim of the survey was not mentioned in the questionnaire. The questionnaire asked about demographic features, physical health, psychological health and environmental nuisance. In the first survey, 544/926 (59%) questionnaires were successfully returned, and after the disaster this figure was 677/900 (75%). Linear regression modelling was used to check whether or not any differences in outcome were due to confounding demographic variables. Results. There was no significant difference in the perceived physical and psychological health of local residents before and after the aircraft crash. A year after the crash, the nuisance level of aircraft noise reported by local residents had markedly increased. Aircraft noise was the major cause of disturbance. More than 1 in 3 residents perceived daily aircraft noise as a nuisance compared with 1 in 6 before the crash. The scores of local inhabitants for annoyance due to aircraft odour and dust doubled after the crash. Compared with control subjects, local inhabitants scored more than 20 times higher for annoyance due to aircraft odour and 40 times higher for annoyance due to dust. The reported nuisance caused by road traffic noise, odour and dust also increased, although to a lesser extent. Conclusion. Health was not influenced by the aircraft crash. A year after the crash, there was a strong drop in tolerance of aircraft nuisance. There was also a reduction in the tolerance of comparable nuisance due, for example, to road traffic, although this change was less marked."

Schwartz, a cancer patient at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), founded the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center at MGH. The Schwartz Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery, which provides hope to the patient, support to caregivers, and sustenance to the healing process. The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. Medical errors are difficult to discuss. Significant medical errors occur in approximately 3% of hospitalizations. Two-thirds are preventable. Despite an entrenched belief that doctors should he infallible, errors are inevitable. Dr. Wendy Levinson of the University of Chicago facilitated a discussion of the impact medical errors have on staff. Staff broke into small groups to share their personal experience and then discussed common themes: the sense of shame and guilt, the punitive culture, guidelines for disclosure to patients and colleagues, and changes in medical practice that can prevent future mistakes. Auditing and improving systems has led to considerable improvements in the field of aviation safety. However, in medicine people are more important than the process. While we should never cease to aim for the very best in delivered care, we must acknowledge how prone we all are to mistakes and that we can learn from and prevent errors. Openly sharing experiences in a confidential setting, such as the Schwartz Rounds, helps defuse feelings of guilt and challenges the culture of shame and isolation that often surrounds medical errors."

Evidence from a number of industrial psychology studies indicates that workers’ perceptions of risk are influenced by the context and culture of their work environment, leading to different ‘worlds of risk’ between professional groups and levels of seniority within the work organization. If perception of risk and safety is not a unified phenomenon within organizational settings, how does one achieve the ‘shared attitudes, perceptions and beliefs with respect to risk and safety’ which are considered fundamental to the development and propagation of a good safety culture? Safety is a dynamic phenomenon that requires continual monitoring from a number of different perspectives in order to prevent incidents. Within the work environment, the ability to communicate to others about potential hazards and the ability to take cognisance of such warnings is fundamental for controlling risks. Professional and social barriers, however, can often prevent such a positive state being achieved. This paper outlines the evidence for the existence of safety subcultures in organizational settings and how conflict and misunderstandings between individuals and teams can lead to accidents and incidents. It is proposed that a type of human factors training (Crew Resource Management), first developed in the aviation industry and now expanded to other domains, may play an important role in improving industrial safety by teaching relevant skills such as communication, leadership, team-working, personal limitations and decision making. CRM may help to break down the barriers that exist between subcultures, allowing personnel with different perspectives on the work situation to share information and work together as a team to resolve problems. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd."

This stimulated the North American government to create national plans to deal with the problem and to form the Quality of Health Care in America Committee composed by outstanding politicians, health care administrators and scientific and medical societies. Several general considerations can be drawn from a MEDLINE review: 1. Between 3.7% and 45.8% of inpatients suffer adverse events. Mortality ranges between 4.9% and 5.6%. Between 51% and 54% of these deaths are preventable. Only 27% can be classified as negligence. 2. Medical error, adverse events, adverse incidents, malpractice or negligence are different ways of defining the subject under study. 3. Adverse events are rarely due to human error alone but are usually associated with a series of coinciding and underlying causes that must be analyzed to understand and prevent repetition. 4. In most cases, human error does not indicate lack of training but rather a failure to act appropriately in a particular moment. Cognitive psychology attempts to explain and throw light on the mechanisms governing human memory, reasoning and performance. 5. Reduction of these events will not be achieved by litigation but rather by prevention. The measures put into practice by industry, and more specifically by civil aviation, could be adapted to the health system. 6. Collaboration among health care personnel is fundamental to understanding the facts and the circumstances in which they occur. This requires confidentiality and the absence of reprisals. 7. Because of the importance of adverse events, a change in medical culture is required to transform a traditionally defensive attitude into one of collaboration to improve quality of health care."

The present study directly compared these types of control with respect to ATCo mental workload, conflict detection, and memory. Eighteen ATCos participated in an air traffic control simulation of Free Flight procedures under moderate and high traffic load. Dependent variables included accuracy and timeliness in detecting potential conflicts, accepting and handing off aircraft, mental workload (as assessed by a secondary task, heart rate variability, and subjective ratings), and memory for aircraft location. High traffic density and passive control both degraded conflict detection performance.

In such cases, the pilot is in a high state of psychological and physiological arousal and tends to focus on one problem, while ignoring more critical information. This study examined the effect of training in physiological self-recognition and regulation, as a means of improving crew cockpit performance. Seventeen pilots were assigned to the treatment and control groups matched for accumulated flight hours. The treatment group contained 4 pilots from HC-130 Hercules aircraft and 4 HH-65 Dolphin helicopter pilots; the control group contained 3 pilots of HC-130s and 6 helicopter pilots. During an initial flight, physiological data were recorded on each crewmember and an instructor pilot rated individual crew performance. Eight crewmembers were then taught to regulate their own physiological response levels using Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE). The remaining participants received no training. During a second flight, treatment participants showed significant improvement in performance (rated by the same instructor pilot as in pretests) while controls did not improve. The results indicate that AFTE management of high states of physiological arousal may improve pilot performance during emergency flying conditions."

Some theories argue for scalability by making the implicit assumption that complex tasks consist of many smaller parts, which are learned according to basic learning principles. Surprisingly, there has been rather sparse empirical testing of this crucial assumption. In this article, we examine this assumption directly by decomposing the learning in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air-Traffic Controller Task (Ackerman, 1988) from the learning at the global level all the way down to the learning at the keystroke level. First, we reanalyze the data from Ackerman (1988) and show that the learning in this complex task does indeed reflect the learning of smaller parts at the keystroke level. Second, in a follow-up eye-tracking experiment, we show that a large portion of the learning at the keystroke level reflects the learning even at a lower, i.e., attentional level. © 2001 Academic Press."

Among them prioritized are purposeful character building and training of future crew members already in childhood and youth. The primary goal is to bring up personality with anthropocosmic thinking as a professional quality that will eventually determine personal and professional reliability. Within the system of psychological support, the central place should be given to monitoring of crew mental heath and behavior, and preventive an corrective measures.

Subjects were 20 male pilot trainees (F (fail) group: mean age 22.6 ± 1.5 years) who were obliged to give up their flight trainings between 1985 and 1996 because of their insufficient technical skills. The control group was made up of 125 male pilot trainees (P (pass) group: mean age 22.4 ± 1.7 years) who were the successful classmates of the unsuccessful trainees. We investigated the differences of the results of group Rorschach test given for employment screening between the two groups. All results of the scores in group Rorschach test were within normal limits both in P group and F group. There, however, were following significant differences between the two groups: (1) F group showed more Key- responses than P group (F group: 4.9±2.1 P group: 3.4±2.0, p < 0.01). (2) F group showed more k responses than P group (F group: 0.2±0.4 P group: 0.02±0.1, p < 0.01). (3) P group showed more FC' responses than F group (F group: 1.4±1.0 P group: 2.2±1.2, p < 0.01). (4) F group showed more cF responses than P group (F group: 1.6±1.2 P group: 1.0±0.9, p < 0.05). (5) P group showed higher form level than F group (F group: 120.6±15.8 P group: 128.2±12.6, p < 0.05). The pilot trainees in F group were suggested to have vulnerability to be nervous and anxious in an inexperienced situation, to decline their ability to cope objectively and effectively with a new situation, and to increase desire for dependence upon others."

Three different personality types for captains were classified based on a previous cluster analysis (3). Crews were comprised of three crewmembers: captain, first officer, and second officer/flight engineer. A total of 72 pilots completed a 1.5-d full-mission simulation of airline operations including emergency situations in the Ames Manned Vehicle System Research Facility B-727 simulator. Crewmembers were tested for perceived stress on four dimensions of the NASA Task Load Index after each of five flight legs. Crews were divided into three groups based on rankings from combined error and rating scores. High performance crews (who committed the least errors in flight) reported experiencing less stress in simulated flight than either low or medium crews. When comparing crew positions for perceived stress over all the simulated flights no significant differences were found. However, the crews led by the 'Right Stuff' (e.g., active, warm, confident, competitive, and preferring excellence and challenges) personality type captains typically reported less stress than crewmembers led by other personality types."

Pilot selection procedures were augmented with the introduction of computer-based testing to assess pilot aptitude. Training procedures have changed in an effort to modernize the training fleet and provide better, more specialized training earlier in the training process. Results: Despite several studies showing the utility of USAF pilot aptitude tests for predicting training performance, results of a recent policy capturing study suggest that this information is often ignored by pilot candidate selection boards. The two largest sources of USAF pilot trainees relied heavily on measures of officership when making selection decisions. Cumulative research findings suggest that USAF pilot selection decisions could be improved by making better use of currently available personnel attribute data. Further improvements could be expected from the addition of a structured selection interview and measures of personality."

In the scientific and professional literature, there is little information about how these facilities operate and what the components of their treatment programs are. This paper is the first review to date to provide this information. Method: There were 212 airlines and treatment facilities approached for information on treatment programs for flying phobia, 43 of which were active in this field. Extensive information could be obtained from 15, which were the best known and well-developed. Information was collected both with a questionnaire and by meeting representatives from 15 international fear of flying treatment facilities that participated in the First International Conference on Fear of Flying (Feb. 1996). Results: Fear of flying among passengers is a phenomenon with epidemic proportions, effecting roughly 10-40% of the adult population. All treatment programs share two basic elements, an information component and a test flight. The programs vary considerably in terms of treatment components. However, there is little available information on efficacy. Conclusions: To date there is a wide variety between facilities for the treatment for fear of flying in terms of methods and protocols used. Experts agree on the clear-cut need for standardization of a 'best' minimum protocol for fear of flying treatment programs for which the main components where identified."

Historically there has been little systematic attempt to explore and assess safety for both staff and patients in the medical domain. Conversely, many methods exist to analyse safety and risks in industrial settings, particularly in high-risk industries such as chemical processing, the nuclear power industry, and aviation. To cope with the increasing demand for risk management methods and tools in the medical domain, the possibility of transferring methods and tools initially developed for industrial settings to the medical domain is investigated. This article questions both the benefits and risks of transferring tools from industry to the medical domain. For this purpose, a taxonomy for classifying organisational root causes of safety-related incidents, developed in the steel industry, will be presented. This taxonomy will then be used to classify organisational root causes of both industrial and medical incidents.

Psychological workload of IFR flight may lead to stress reactions such as neuroendocrine activity. Methods: Neuroendocrine responses to an IFR flight with Vinka piston-engined primary trainer were studied in 35 male volunteers who participated in the basic military flying course of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). The student pilots performed a 40-min IFR flight mission and a control session on land in randomized order between 11.00 h and 15.00 h. The IFR flight included 3 NDB approaches and was evaluated by flight instructors. Blood samples were collected 15 min before, 5 min and 60 min after the flight as well as control session, and. Plasma ACTH, β-endorphin (BE), cortisol, prolactin, adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) were measured. Psychological evaluations included psychomotor test (Wiener), Multi Coordination and Attention Test, ability tests and personality tests (CMPS and 16 PF). The overall psychological evaluation was made by an aviation psychologist. Results: Plasma ACTH was significantly higher before and 5 min after the flight compared with control levels, but plasma BE increased significantly only before the flight. Plasma cortisol was significantly elevated before and 5 min after the flight. Plasma prolactin. NA and A increases were significant 5 min after the flight. High A levels after the flight correlated significantly with poor IFR flight performance as well as with poor psychomotor test results. Conclusions: The plasma prolactin and NA increases after the flight represented a direct type of stress reaction to the flight situation. The plasma BE response to IFR flight was an anticipatory stress reaction, but plasma ACTH, cortisol and A responses included both anticipatory and direct types of stress reactions. Psychological factors, flight performance and neuroendocrine responses to IFR flight appear to be associated with each other. Therefore, neuroendocrine reactions as a response to the psychological workload of military flying could be used for identifying stress tolerance in military pilots."

Aircrew suffering from CHD should be enrolled in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation including smoking cessation, physical training, stress management, dietary and vocational counselling. Risk stratification early after the coronary event will identify low-risk patients who may be able to resume multi-pilot flight operations and those who are less likely to fulfil the criteria for recertification.

Like previous research, the complex, time-sharing, synthetic work-task may have contributed to the age group differences. Two simple cognitive and psychomotor tasks also used in this study showed a significant age-related difference in only one measure. A better tolerance to the sleep-loss condition may explain the stable performance of the older group across sessions. Gender differences occurred during the latter sessions for several measures. The younger female group demonstrated the most significant decline in task performance across the last three sessions, presumably due to sleep loss-induced fatigue."

"Characteristics of nystagmus and illusion evoked by optokinetic stimuli","1998","Hangtian Yixue Yu Yixue Gongcheng/Space Medicine and Medical Engineering","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032267808&partnerID=40&md5=58165289f9d0afcd0ddacb7860232315","To study the characteristics of human psychophysiological responses to optokinetic stimulus, 30 male medical students were given a series of optokinetic step stimulus (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 deg/sec) (clockwise). Each stimulus lasted for 20 seconds. Optokinetic nystagmus was recorded on tape. At the same time, the latency and estimated fuzzy magnitude of the illusion were noted down. The nystagmus was analysed with a computer system of ENG and the magnitude of illusion was measured with a fuzzy set model. The results are: 1. Both the slow velocity (SV) and fast velocity (FV) of optokinetic nystagmus increase as stimulus speeds up and reaches their peaks at 60 deg/sec, which remains constant from 60 to 120 deg/sec. 2. From 5 to 120 deg/sec, the magnitude of optokinetic illusion increases linearly as stimulus speeds up. Optokinetic illusion and optokinetic nystagmus are human psychophysiological responses to the same optokinetic stimulus, they are different in trend of change, and when optokinetic stimulus is at 60-120 deg/sec, illusion response is more stable than nystagmus response."

In recent years, cognitive psychologists have developed theories for understanding and analyzing human error, and the application of these principles has decreased error rates in the aviation and nuclear power industries. The purpose of this study was to apply error analysis to laparoscopic surgery and evaluate its potential for preventing complications. Our approach is based on James Reason's framework using a classification of errors according to three performance levels: At the skill-based performance level, slips are caused by attention failures (eg, inattention, overattention), and lapses result from memory failures (eg, omitting, forgetting plans). Rule-based mistakes (eg, misapplication of good rule or application of bad rule) constitute the second level. Knowledge-based mistakes occur at the highest performance level and are caused by shortcomings in conscious processing (eg, selectivity, workspace limitations, confirmation bias, overconfidence, inadequate training). These errors committed by the performer,, at the sharp end″ occur in typical situations which often times are brought about by already built-in latent system failures. We present a series of case studies in laparoscopic surgery (eg, bile duct injury during lap cholecystectomy, perforation during lap fundoplication) in which errors are classified and the influence of intrinsic failures and extrinsic system flaws are evaluated. Most serious technical errors in lap surgery stem from a rule-based or knowledge-based mistake triggered by cognitive underspecification due to incomplete or illusory visual input information. Error analysis in laparoscopic surgery should be able to improve human performance, and it should detect and help eliminate system flaws. Complication rates in laparoscopic surgery due to technical errors can thus be considerably reduced."

Through the determination of auditory reaction time to the Chinese speech warning under dual-tasks and the subjective evaluation of the suitable time length of main warning voice by the subject, the optimum parameters of Chinese speech warning in accordance with space ergonomics were determined. It is found that: suitable time length of main warning voice is 0.35-0.55 s, main interval is 0.15-0.35 s, speech speed is 4-6 word/s, and sentence interval is 0.2-0.4 s. Meanwhile, the analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) demonstrate that the speech warning using the mentioned parameters doesn't increase the operator's work load. The results can serve as the objective ergonomical basis and the evaluation criterion for the design of speech warning in manned space vehicle."

In spite of a random relationship between all slide categories and outcome (illusory correlation), flight phobics exhibited a covariation bias and showed higher CEs for the contingency between FR slides and shocks than for the contingency between FI slides and shocks in a first experimental block. The CEs of flight phobics for FR slides and shocks was significantly higher than that of non-flight-phobic individuals, while high- and low-fear participants did not differ in their CEs for the other slide- shock combinations. However, even high-fear individuals were able to correct their initial covariation bias in subsequent illusory correlation blocks, presumably based on disconfirming situational information."

By definition, all aviation personnel with a diagnosed personality disorder or those with maladaptive personality traits that have had a documented effect on safety of flight, crew coordination, or mission completion, are determined to be Not Aeronautically Adapted (NAA). Methods: NAA dispositions were examined for demographic data, basis for disposition, and frequency of personality features. Results: NAA dispositions were made on the basis of personality disorders and maladaptive personality traits in 29% and 35% of the cases, respectively. The officer and enlisted NAA dispositions were distinctly different in terms of frequency of personality features. Obsessive-compulsive features were present in 58% of officer and 10% of enlisted NAA dispositions. Dependent and avoidant features were present in excess in comparison to psychologically healthy aviators, suggesting the incompatibility of these features with aviation."

Therefore, in the United Kingdom, suicide definitely accounts for 0.72% of general aviation accidents and possibly for more than 2.4%. The latter accords more closely with the findings from Germany than from the United States. Previous psychiatric or domestic problems and alcohol misuse are features of these cases. Aerobatics before the final impact is another frequent finding. The investigation of fatal accidents involving 'pilot error' is incomplete without an examination of the victim's social and psychological history. An assessment of a pilot's mental well-being is an essential part of aviation medical examinations."

Methods: The pilots were divided into two groups: one group consisting of eight pilots (N = 8) who had experienced several acute in-flight neck pain attacks, and the control group (N = 8) who had not experienced these pain conditions under similar work and environment conditions. In each pilot cold pain thresholds and pain and unpleasantness responses to suprathreshold cold stimulations were recorded during repeated tests. The ratings of pain and unpleasantness responses to cold stimulations were evaluated by visual analog scales (VAS). The effect of exercise on cold pain sensitivity was tested in a separate experiment. Exercise was performed on a cycle ergometer at different workload levels (50-200 W). Results: In the control conditions (resting measures) of this study during repeated cold pressor tests, the average pain thresholds and pain or unpleasantness responses to suprathreshold cold stimulation were not different between groups. Physical exercise increased pain thresholds (P < 0.001) in pilots with a history of neck pain attacks but not in control group. Exercise induced a significant decrease in pain responses and unpleasantness responses to suprathreshold stimulation in both groups. This exercise effect was more marked both in pain intensity (P < 0.05) and unpleasantness responses (P < 0.01) in pilots with a history of neck pain attacks. Moreover, exercise more markedly (P < 0.05) decreased unpleasantness than pain intensity responses in both groups of pilots. Conclusions: The results suggest that exercise stress-related analgesia mechanisms may be enhanced in pilots with a history of acute in-flight neck pain attacks. Moreover, sensory and nonsensory aspects of pain experience may be differentially influenced by exercise stress."

Methods. - The IDEALS concept of design was used to identify specifications for the event-reporting system, and a Delphi and subsequent nominal group technique meetings were used to reach consensus on the development of the system. An interdisciplinary panel of experts from aviation safety, nuclear power, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and education and representatives of major transfusion medicine organizations participated in the development process. Setting. - Three blood centers and three hospitals transfusion services implemented the reporting system. Results. - A working prototype event- reporting system was recommended and implemented. The system has seven components: detection, selection, description, classification, computation, interpretation, and local evaluation. Its unique features include no-fault reporting initiated by the individual discovering the event, who submits a report that is investigated by local quality assurance personnel and forwarded to a nonregulatory central system for computation and interpretation. Conclusions. - An event-reporting system incorporated into present quality assurance and risk management efforts can help organizations address system structural and procedural weakness where the potential for errors can adversely affect health care outcomes. Input from the end users of the system as well as from external experts should enable this reporting system to serve as a useful model for others who may develop event-reporting systems in other medical domains."

It is mandatory in the UK that all airline pilots undertake CRM training. CRM emerged as a result of accident analysis (e.g. Tenerife air disaster) which showed that human factors relating to leadership, problem solving, communication, team working and stress management were contributing to near misses and accidents. The training is based on ongoing research which identifies particular areas to target and the aim is to reduce errors by catching them before they become problems, and to enable crews to function at the highest level of efficiency if a problem does occur. CRM is being used with medical teams, nuclear power plant crews and maintenance crews, and it appears that this type of focused human factors training is particularly suitable for offshore safety management. Using the results from our offshore research projects we are designing a prototype version of CRM for offshore crews. This is one method of ‘closing the loop’ between accident analysis and response. Details of the CRM training and new evaluation project for the UK oil and gas industry will be covered. This work is a part of a larger project called ‘Factoring the human into safety: Translating research into practice being carried out by the Industrial Psychology group of Aberdeen University.

The capabilities now offered by simulation have created unlimited opportunities for aviation training. In fact, aviation training is now more realistic, safe, cost-effective, and flexible than ever before. However, we believe that a number of misconceptions - or invalid assumptions - exist in the simulation community that prevent us from fully exploiting and utilizing recent scientific advances in a number of related fields in order to further enhance aviation training. These assumptions relate to the overreliance on high-fidelity simulation and to the misuse of simulation to enhance learning of complex skills. The purpose of this article is to discuss these assumptions in the hope of initiating a dialogue between behavioral scientists and engineers."

The authors propose that many instances of superordinate and subordinate behavior in the cockpit-the captain's tendency to reject input from other team members and the first officer's hesitancy to question the captain-represent cases of status generalization. First, the authors describe the theory of status generalization and show support for the operation of the theory by presenting examples of flightcrew behavior that the theory predicts. Second, an initial empirical test was conducted to instantiate the claim that captain-first officer differences can be seen as status differences. Finally, the significance and implications of this perspective are discussed."

Because of the challenges presented by seasonal variations, poor weather conditions and demanding operational task requirements, the importance of an optimal working environment to ensure crew health and safe flight operations should be emphasized. In the Norwegian concept of Health, Environment and Safety (HES), all aspects of the working environment have been taken into consideration, including human factors, ergonomics, physical and chemical factors as well as social and organizational psychology. As civilian legislation excludes military aviation in this area, the RNoAF has developed a new system that allows HES improvements to be implemented in a more efficient way. This system is based on a new military regulation for HES in RNoAF flight operations. Good coordination of HES issues, predictability and standard handling procedures are key elements in this system which is meant to be an effective managerial tool for correct HES decision-making."

To provide the highest levels of safety, the level of attention, particularly visual awareness, has to be monitored. The infrequent, but catastrophic disasters caused by aviation controller mistakes could be avoided with attention monitoring. Furthermore, the recent explosion in the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder and related learning disabilities has increased the demand for an attention monitoring tool, possibly as a screening tool or a therapeutic biofeedback mechanism. A system has been designed, off-line, as a precedent to a real-time awareness predictor. The electroencephalograph (EEG) is used as the major predictive data with a radial basis function network classifying the attention level. Two different receptive field placements were used for each subject. Using a system trained to each subject, the results show the ability to predict performance from the EEG spectrum. The subject's habituation was directly correlated to the accuracy of the system."

Method: The subjects performed the same flight mission twice; first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with the BA Hawk MK 51 jet trainer with Gz-forces below +2. The mission included: a) 2 min rest after seating; b) take-off; c) ILS approach in the minimum weather conditions (initial, intermediate and final approach); d) landing tour (visual approach); and e) landing. The heart rates were continuously measured using a small portable recorder developed at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland. The R-R intervals were stored and analyzed with an accuracy of 1 ms. The different phases of each flight were marked in the data by using codes given beforehand for each critical event. Results: The take-off resulted in a significant increase in the heart rate from the resting levels both in the cadets and the flight instructors in both planes. In the simulator the heart rate decreased during the initial approach and slightly increased after it during the intermediate approach. Thereafter the heart rate decreased during the landing tour which seemed to be the least psychologically demanding phase of the simulated flight. The heart rate increased again during the landing but did not exceed the heart rates measured during the take-off and the ILS- approach. There were no statistical differences between the groups. In the jet trainer no decrease in the heart rate could be observed immediately after the take-off, unlike in the case of the simulated flight. The inflight heart rate increased during the final approach, decreased during the landing tour and finally increased during the landing. According to the heart rate analysis the final approach was the most loaded phase of the real flight. The changes towards the phases of final approach and landing were greater among the flight instructors. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between the mean heart rates during the real and the simulated flight. It is suggested that the heart rate changes for most reflected the changes in cognitive workload."

Flight segments involved various combinations of maneuvering of heading, altitude and airspeed. Expert pilots performed better than novices on vertical and longitudinal, but not lateral control. They accomplished their superior vertical tracking by allocating more control resources to the vertical control. Analyses of scanning strategies revealed that experts: a) had shorter dwells and more frequent visits to most instruments; b) adapted their visiting strategy more flexibly in response to changing task demands; c) demonstrated a better mental model of cross-coupling and predictive relations between and within axes; and d) showed more frequent checking of axes whose values remained constant.

When United Airlines conducted its routine medical certifications in 1994, both pilots were discovered to have AIDS and were immediately grounded. Neither were offered any alternative forms of employment and neither requested it. Both filed with private insurers and with Social Security for disability benefits. Rafalowski deteriorated quickly and died in March 1996. Prilliman remained in fairly good health and his motor and intellectual skills remained within normal range. The lawsuits said that United Airlines violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). Only the FEHA claim reached the Court of Appeal. The court found that because Rafalowski was incapable of working an eight-hour day, he could not be accommodated with another job. However, Prilliman should have had an opportunity for employment with United.

Causal model parameters were estimated separately for each sample and, due to the small sample size for women, no between-groups statistical tests were conducted. The results are viewed as tentative because of the small sample of female students; however, the path coefficient parameter estimates are still useful. The model showed a direct influence of general cognitive ability (g) on the acquisition of job knowledge and an indirect influence on the acquisition of flying skills. The direct and indirect influence of cognitive ability on flying skills was a little stronger for women than for men. Additionally, the path between prior job knowledge (JK<inf>p</inf>) and flying performance was somewhat stronger for women than for men. Consistent with previous findings, the influence of early flying skills on later flying skills was very strong. No argument for a sex-separated training syllabus is supported."

Early professional aging of this group is obvious; it is caused by deterioration of the health status and by destruction of motivation coupled with the pension policy pursued with regard to military pilots. Pilots engaged in the training of young specialists are in need of sociopsychological monitoring and regular and comprehensive measures aimed at health maintenance and rehabilitation.

However, heterogeneous conditions which can present with fear of flying, demand that a more stringent and systematic approach be made in one's management of the aviator with fear of flying (FOF). Cases of FOF between 1974 and 1995 presented to the Civil Aviation Medical Board and the Aeromedical Centre of the Republic of Singapore Airforce were studied for their psychopathology, psychodynamics, diagnoses, motivation for treatment, type of treatment and response to treatment, and their eventual outcome in relation to flying. 53.3% of 15 cases had Adult Situational Reaction, 26.7% had phobia of flying, 6.6% had Adjustment Disorder, 6.7% had Anxiety Depressive Disorder and 6.7% had Transient Psychosis. All cases of Adjustment Disorder were returned to flying, compared with 25% of Adult Situational Reaction, 66.7% of Phobia of Flying and none of the aircrew suffering from Transient Psychosis. Fear of flying is thus a complex phenomenon, where there is interaction of elements of mental health, neurotic roots, real and imaginary threats and life events affecting eventually the flyer's willingness to fly."

Method: Two aeromedical psychologists retrospectively reviewed consecutive student pilot referrals to the mental health clinic at the U.S. Army Aviation Training Center at Fort Rucker, AL. Data on completion of flight training was later obtained. Results: We identified 99 cases manifesting symptomatology associated with difficulty establishing aeronautical adaptation. Prominent syndromes (and prevalence) were: Anxiety (26%); Marital Conflict (22%); Somatization (15%); Depression (13%); Phobic Reactions (12%); and Misconduct (11%). Phobic reactions presented earlier in training, whereas marital conflicts were more prominent later in training. All phobic students were eliminated from training; 45% of all others completed training. Completion was significantly more likely for students with Anxiety and Marital Conflicts that manifested after primary flight training. Conclusions: The identification of discrete syndromes with differing outcomes highlights the need for early identification and classification of student pilots with psychiatric symptoms reflecting difficulty in aeronautical adaptation."

Although the names and appearances of the tests used in pilot selection vary, most are to a large extent measures of general cognitive ability, or g. This is consistent with the central role played by cognitive ability measures in the prediction of numerous job training (r = 0.43) and performance (r = 0.34) criteria. Measures of specific cognitive abilities (e.g., verbal, quantitative, spatial, perceptual speed) have shown little incremental validity beyond g (increase in correlation of about 0.02). The incremental validity, beyond g, of measures of pilot job knowledge (e.g., aviation concepts, instruments, principles and terms; increase in correlation beyond g of about 0.08), psychomotor abilities, and personality scores (increase in correlation beyond g between 0.02 and 0.04) also has been small, but significant. The unavoidable requirement to reason in responding to test material causes g to be measured. In broad-ability-range samples, the positive correlations of the measures demonstrate that general cognitive ability is always present as a higher-order factor. Future measures of pilot aptitude may include tests based on cognitive components, chronometric methods, neural conductive velocity, or other methods. These measures, despite their appearance, have been shown to mostly measure g. Subsequently, we expect that future U.S. Air Force pilot selection tests will mostly be measures of g and will, therefore, continue to be predictive of performance."

Psychophysiology has two complementary roles in research on adaptive automation: first, to provide information about the effects of different forms of automation thus promoting the development of effective adaptive logic; and second, psychophysiology may yield information about the operator that can be integrated with performance measurement and operator modelling to aid in the regulation of automation. This review discusses the basic tenets of adaptive automation and the role of psychophysiological measures in the study of adaptive automation. Empirical results from studies of flight simulation are presented. Psychophysiological measures may prove especially useful in the prevention of performance deterioration in underload conditions that may accompany automation. Individual differences and the potential for learned responses require research to understand their influence on adaptive algorithms. Adaptive automation represents a unique domain for the application of psychophysiology in the work environment."

Certain characteristics of this job are likely to produce stress; for example an ATC can not predict when a situation becomes critical and he is not able to regulate the workload. In order to assess psychophysiological stress reactions in this working situation, saliva samples were taken from 158 male air traffic controllers before and after each of two working sessions. In contrast to the expected immunosuppressive effects, the working sessions caused a marked increase in the concentration and secretion rate of salivary immunoglobulin A (sIgA), as well as in the concentration of salivary cortisol. The increase in sIgA, however, was not correlated with the salivary cortisol response or with the amount of actual or perceived workload, whereas the cortisol response was correlated with both workload measures. It is suggested that positive emotional engagement is responsible for the observed sIgA increase and that measuring this physiological response may be a valuable tool for differentiating between positive and negative stress effects or between successful and unsuccessful adaptation or coping with situational demands."

Primary Outcome Measure: Return to flying duties during a minimum follow-up period of 2 yr. Results: Within 2 yr from psychiatric admission, 138 (64.5%) aviators returned to flying status; 141 (65.9%) returned over 7 yr. In this patient population, an affective disorder diagnosis predicted poor outcome (χ 2 = 12.86; df = 1; p = 0.0003), independent of length of hospitalization.

The next best predictors were tests measuring cognitive (.24) and psychomotor/information-processing abilities (.24), as well as aviation information (.24) and biographical inventories (.23). The personality, intelligence, and academic tests yielded lowest mean validities (.14, .16, and .15, respectively).

A study was conducted to determine if SA in U.S. Air Force F-15 pilots could be predicted. The participants were 171 active duty F-15 A/C pilots who completed a test battery representative of various psychological constructs proposed or demonstrated to be valid for the prediction of performance in a wide variety of military and civilian jobs. These predictors encompassed measures of cognitive ability, psychomotor ability, and personality. Supervisor and peer ratings of SA were collected. Supervisors and peers showed substantial agreement on the SA ratings of the pilots. The first unrotated principle component extracted from the supervisor and peer ratings accounted for 92.5% of the variability of ratings. The unrotated first principal component served as the SA criterion. Flying experience measured in number of F-15 hours was the best predictor of SA. After controlling for the effects of F-15 flying hours, the measures of general cognitive ability based on working memory, spatial reasoning, and divided attention were found to be predictive of SA. Psychomotor and personality measures were not predictive. With additional F-15 flying hours it is expected that pilots would improve their ratings of SA."

Additionally, the applicants were graded in a simulator checkflight. On the basis of training records, the pilots were classified as performing either at standard or below standard after about 3 years of employment in the hiring company. In a multiple-regression model, this dichotomous criterion for job success can be predicted with 73.8% accuracy through the simulator checkflight and flying experience prior to employment. By adding the personality questionnaire to the regression equation, the number of correct classifications increases to 79.3%.

External cues can support the triggering of an action or memory for the content of the action. We focused on memory for the content, and manipulated the temporal characteristics of the external cue to disentangle two possible functions the cue can support: (1) an external cue visible during a retention interval could support rehearsal of the to-be-performed action; (2) an external cue visible at the end of a retention interval could support retrieval of the to-be-performed action. Two experiments were conducted that converge on the same conclusion: the primary function of an external cue is to support retrieval.

The noise featured a Dopplerlike quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d‘) was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a “floor effect” rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload. The results provide the initial experimental demonstration that perceived workload is a sensitive measure of the effects of aircraft noise in monitoring tasks. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This model proposes that autonomic nervous system influences on the heart may change with psychological processing in ways that are not evident in heart rate. A method of mental-workload assessment was proposed that used multiple psychophysiological measures of cardiovascular responsivity to derive the underlying sympathetic and parasympathetic information needed to represent the autonomic space for heart rate. Principal-components analysis was used to extract Sympathetic and Parasympathetic components from heart period, residual heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and Traube-HeringMayer wave in three experiments that manipulated perceptual/central processing and physical task demands. This initial evaluation of the method concluded that the autonomic components were valid and that the components had greater diagnosticity, and for some manipulations greater sensitivity, than heart rate.

This includes healthcare systems. (2) Managing the human risks will never be 100% effective. Human fallibility can be moderated, but it cannot be eliminated. (3) Different error types have different underlying mechanisms, occur in different parts of the organisation, and require different methods of risk management. The basic distinctions are between: Slips, lapses, trips, and fumbles (execution failures) and mistakes (planning or problem solving failures). Mistakes are divided into rule based mistakes and knowledge based mistakes. Errors (information-handling problems) and violations (motivational problems) Active versus latent failures. Active failures are committed by those in direct contact with the patient, latent failures arise in organisational and managerial spheres and their adverse effects may take a long time to become evident. (4) Safety significant errors occur at all levels of the system, not just at the sharp end. Decisions made in the upper echelons of the organisation create the conditions in the workplace that subsequently promote individual errors and violations. Latent failures are present long before an accident and are hence prime candidates for principled risk management. (5) Measures that involve sanctions and exhortations (that is, moralistic measures directed to those at the sharp end) have only very limited effectiveness, especially so in the case of highly trained professionals. (6) Human factors problems are a product of a chain of causes in which the individual psychological factors (that is, momentary inattention, forgetting, etc) are the last and least manageable links. Attentional ""capture"" (preoccupation or distraction) is a necessary condition for the commission of slips and lapses. Yet, its occurrence is almost impossible to predict or control effectively. The same is true of the factors associated with forgetting. States of mind contributing to error are thus extremely difficult to manage; they can happen to the best of people at any time. (7) People do not act in isolation. Their behaviour is shaped by circumstances. The same is true for errors and violations. The likelihood of an unsafe act being committed is heavily influenced by the nature of the task and by the local workplace conditions. These, in turn, are the product of ""upstream"" organisational factors. Great gains in safety can ve achieved through relatively small modifications of equipment and workplaces. (8) Automation and increasing advanced equipment do not cure human factors problems, they merely relocate them. In contrast, training people to work effectively in teams costs little, but has achieved significant enhancements of human performance in aviation. (9) Effective risk management depends critically on a confidential and preferable anonymous incident monitoring system that records the individual, task, situational, and organisational factors associated with incidents and near misses. (10) Effective risk management means the simultaneous and targeted deployment of limited remedial resources at different levels of the system: the individual or team, the task, the situation, and the organisation as a whole."

Also, some pilots will sustain head injuries that will affect their flying careers. The complex and unforgiving nature of aviation demands a conservative approach to occupational return after neurological insult. Therefore, a neuropsychological assessment is required to return to flying. The lack of pre-injury neuropsychological data, however, hinders accurate assessment of post-injury functioning. Hypotheses: a) Psychological data may improve the pilot selection and assignment processes as military resources dwindle; and b) baseline intellectual/cognitive data may support the scientific basis of aeromedical decision-making. Methods: Neuropsychiatrically Enhanced Flight Screening (N-EFS) attempts to validate the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB), CogScreen, Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PI-R), and Personal Characteristics Inventory (PCI) for pilot selection and cockpit assignment. N-EFS also measures baseline intelligence (using the MAB) and cognitive functioning (using the CogScreen) for comparison purposes if a future medical flying waiver is needed after neurological insult. These assessments will compare the aviator's postinjury functioning to a personal intellectual functioning baseline captured at entry into aviation training. Results: N-EFS students are scoring from below average to very superior in intellectual assessment. Very preliminary personality testing results suggest few significant differences between male and female student pilots, with high extraversion being the most striking personality characteristic. Discussion: The wide range of intellectual functioning in pilot candidates argues for baseline data collection to improve future aeromedical decisions."

This study investigated the heart rate and anxiety response to parachuting among seven novice and six experienced parachutists. Heart rate was measured from the moment of boarding the aircraft until landing. Anxiety was measured prior to boarding the aircraft. Heart rate was significantly higher among the novice compared to the experienced parachutists, especially during takeoff (125 ± 11 vs. 95 ± 17 beats · min-1, respectively), and upon exit or free fall (184 ± 12 vs. 164 ± 17 boats · min-1, respectively). However, due to the difference in ages between the groups, when expressed relative to maximal heart rate, there was no difference in the heart rote response between groups (e.g., exit/free fall: 93.0 ± 5.5% vs. 88.4 ± 7.8% for novice and experienced, respectively). No statistical differences were observed in the anxiety scores between groups, although the novice parachutists scored somewhat higher (16.0 ± 3.7 vs. 12.5 ± 5.7, respectively). A significant correlation (r = 0.72) was observed between heart rate upon landing and the state anxiety scores. These results demonstrate a high psychophysiological stress response to parachuting among both novice and experienced parachutists. It is likely that novice parachutists are stressed to a higher degree and may therefore be mare prone to performance-related injury (e.g., upon landing). However, since both groups reached a similar percentage of their maximal heart rate, they may be at a similar risk of cardiac injury."

The relationship between auditory warning sound parameters and perceived urgency is, therefore, an important topic of enquiry in aviation psychology. The present investigation examined the relationship among subjective assessments of urgency, reaction time, and brainwave activity with three auditory warning signals. Subjects performed a tracking task involving automated and manual conditions, and were presented with auditory warnings having various levels of perceived and situational urgency. Subjective assessments revealed that subjects were able to rank warnings on an urgency scale, but rankings were altered after warnings were mapped to a situational urgency scale. Reaction times differed between automated and manual tracking task conditions, and physiological data showed attentional differences in response to perceived and situational warning urgency levels. This study shows that the use of physiological measures sensitive to attention and arousal, in conjunction with behavioural and subjective measures, may lead to the design of auditory warnings that produce a sense of urgency in an operator that matches the urgency of the situation. © 1995 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

"The effect of an in-flight, emergency training program on crew confidence","1994","Air Medical Journal","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028415054&partnerID=40&md5=d5238ac21d9d55acea71909e6aaa8792","Abstract. Introduction: Despite some progress, the air medical transport profession continues to experience widely publicized accidents that result in injuries and death to crew members and patients. An air medical crew member's experience, training and confidence may affect his or her ability to deal effectively with an in-flight emergency, and may also affect his or her behavior before and after the emergency. Setting: A hospital-based, rural rotor- and fixed-wing program flying approximately 890 flights per year. Seventy-seven percent of these flights are interfacility. Methods: A pretraining survey evaluated the experiences of air medical crew members and pilots. A 20-question assessment tool based on a 5-point Likert scale evaluated how confident the individuals were in their ability to react to in-flight emergencies. An extensive in-flight emergency training program was then conducted. Personnel were asked to complete the same questionnaire one month and six months after the training. Results: On the pretraining questionnaire, flight crew members with neither prior training nor actual experience in in-flight emergencies showed the lowest level of confidence. Those with prior training, actual in-flight emergency experience or both, responded with higher levels of confidence. The mean confidence scores of the study participants increased from 82 pretraining to 89 at one month post-training and remained at the increased level six months after training. Conclusions: A training program focusing on in-flight, aircraft-related emergencies can increase the crew's confidence during such situations. This increase in confidence is most noticeable in those without previous training or experience and is maintained for at least six months. Several other benefits occur from the training program. © 1994."
"Burnout and health status in Italian air traffic controllers","1994","Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028314261&partnerID=40&md5=a9b0cffec5827e980f3abd4ee58472f4","This study investigated burnout in air traffic controllers (ATC's). There were 109 Italian ATC's who filled out the Rome Burnout Inventory, a new tool for burnout assessment, during breaks in the working environment. The questionnaire assessed: 1) emotional-mental exhaustion (EME); 2) physical exhaustion (PE); 3) social support by components of the social network; 4) work- and nonwork-related stressors; 5) self-reported psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. Our data show that the burnout syndrome is closely and positively related to age, years spent in air traffic control, professional dissatisfaction, and to work stressors, but not to nonwork stressors. In our sample, burnout was negatively correlated with social support provided by friends and family. The PE construct seemed to be unreliable in detecting physical burnout in Italian ATC's. Using analysis of variance, subjects with self-reported psychosomatic disorders did not show higher levels of EME scores. Further, EME was positively correlated with self-perceived psychological distress (anxiety, depression and impulse discontrol), but not with physician-rated psychopathology, as revealed by psychoactive drug intake. We suggest that burnout is a construct independent from clinical anxiety or depression."

Twenty aircraft crash fatalities were also reported during this period in which the intent of death could not be determined as either suicide, homicide, or accidental. White middle-aged males accounted for the majority of deaths. The NTSB reported, for the years 1979-89, that nine fatal aircraft accidents were suicide. All fatalities were male pilots operating small fixed wing aircraft. NTSB investigations identified evidence for important adverse psychologic factors in most pilots."

CRM training is usually a student's first exposure to crew operations, requiring the college to modify airline training to create meaningful learning for inexperienced pilots. Research with airline pilots has found that line-oriented flight training (LOFT) was most effective for teaching CRM. LOFT is best when airline crews debrief themselves using self-analysis to evaluate their CRM performance. The study investigated whether undergraduate flight students could effectively learn CRM skills by using self-analysis of LOFT as a debriefing strategy, despite their inexperience with crew operations. Eight men and two women completed CRM and LOFT training. Self-analysis was randomly inserted into their training using an alternating treatments research design. Crew effectiveness was assessed by measurements of crew attitudes, observations by trained observers, crew reflections on their performance, and communications analysis. It was found that at least one self-analysis session was effective for each crew, and overall gains were noted for two of the five crews. Self-analysis was effective when crews had the prerequisite technical skills and was ineffective if technical skills were lacking or if the scenario was too complex. Results suggest that self-analysis should not be applied universally in undergraduate flight training, but it is a valuable supplementary strategy to focus attention on personalities, roles, team dynamics, or specific CRM skills."

Its motor dysfunction is manifested by impaired speech, gait, and coordination, and by psychomotor retardation. Several scientific reports indicate that ADC may be the earliest, and, at times, the only evidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and may present a diagnostic challenge, particularly in the aviation context. Several aviation medicine specialists have pointed out the safety questions raised by this condition when it presents in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Since October 1985, U.S. military pilots have been tested for the presence of HIV antibody and grounded if found positive. In May 1991, the Executive Council of the Aerospace Medical Association approved a position statement that supports testing of pilots for infection by HIV, and maintains that ""individuals confirmed to be infected should be found medically disqualified for flying duties."" While bureaucrats delay in resolving HIV mandatory screening, HIV-encephalopathy may be precipitously brought to light, with symptoms involving ocular motor disorders such as dissociated nystagmus, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and impaired saccadic function and smooth pursuit, frequent signs of HIV cerebellar and pontomesencephalic dysfunction."

But what about the situation where a patient's substance abuse impairs safe driving of a large commercial vehicle such as an airplane, clearly endangering a class of individuals (passengers)? Some legal restrictions on confidentiality, if followed literally, would not even permit the therapist to take preventive measures advocated by the Tarasoff court when deliberate violence is threatened, let alone more specific measures to prevent a tragic accident with loss of many lives. Review of literature on the relationship between alcohol and operator safety leads to the conclusion that therapists must have some latitude in which to exercise judgment free of professional liability. The dilemma posed by contrasting duties to maintain confidentiality and to make preventive disclosures is too rigid to govern all situations, especially a worsening risk of substance-induced accidents by drivers of public carriers."

Automaticity has, however, a cost that manifests itself in procedures that are highly routinized but require close attention, such as verbal checklist procedures. In such procedures, errors occur because the routine leads to automaticity. In three paper-and-pen experiments, we tested this manifestation and investigated ways to decrease automaticity in verbal checklist procedures. In the experiments, subjects proofread sets of multiplication problems to detect erroneous operations, simulating the checklist procedure. In Experiments 1 and 2, two conditions were compared: a fixed-order condition (in which each set contained operations in the same order) and a varied-order condition (in which the operations were in a different order in each set). In Experiment 1, proofreading times were measured to establish the role of fixed sequential order as a consistent environment promoting the emergence of automaticity. In Experiment 2, we introduced errors into the material, and in Experiment 3 we introduced ""alerting"" conditions to interfere with the development of automaticity. The results indicated that the subjects in the varied-order and alert conditions detected significantly more errors than did those in the fixed-order condition. The implications of the findings for current theories of automaticity are discussed as well as those for the design of checklist procedures. © 1993 Psychonomic Society, Inc."

Standard psychometric statistics were computed for the PRF subscales. Comparison with information given in the test manual shows that the reliability of all PRF subscales declines in personnel selection. Strong ceiling effects, which were caused by response sets (mainly Social Desirability), were identified as the reason for this phenomenon. The Temperament Structure Scales (TSS), a questionnaire constructed for selection conditions, were presented to the same group. The computed factor-analytic results indicated that the factor structure of the TSS is very similar to that of the PRF. No detrimental downward trend could be revealed for the subscale reliabilities of the TSS. Thus, it seems necessary to construct questionnaires within specific selection conditions to make them robust with respect to the negative psychometric effects of selection. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The number of aircraft under control per hour was recorded as index of workload. Recordings involved subjective ratings (mood, physical fitness, fatigue) and objective measures (hean rate, vanilJyl mandelic acid excretion, reaction times, critical flicker fusion, oral temperature). In addition, the subjects fined out questionnaires for personality traits (extroversion, neuroticis, anxiety) and behavioural characteristics (momingness, rigidity of sleeping habits, vigourness to overcome drowsiness). The volume of air traffic varied greatly with peaks during the day and low levels at night. Nevertheless, the heart rates of the group members showed quite constant levels in all the three shifts, irrespective of the workload. The same pattern appeared in the controllers' excretion of VMA, which remained high during both day and night shifts, regardless of the reduced workload. The subjective mood and physical fitness decreased similarly, while feelings of fatigue increased on all three shifts, particularly on the night shift. The circadian rhythm of the oral temperature showed a slight modification of the noctural depression during the night shift, caused by the state of awakeness and activity. However, the rhythm was not altered in its normal circadian phase, due to the fast shift rotation adopted. The psychophysiological responses were affected by personal characteristics, in particular momingness and ability to overcome drowsiness. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd."

The pilots' data were found to have a wider range of values for the physiological measures than were found in the WSO data. The different levels of tracking task difficulty produced significant physiological effects but the range of values found for most of the flight segments were much greater.

The data were gathered by measurements of the circadian rhythms of melatonin excretion and ahertness at 2 h intervals in Helsinki (Finland) two days before westward flight to Los Angeles (USA), where the measurements were repeated on the 2nd day after the flights and on the 2nd day in Finland after return flight. This shift in the acrophases of the two circadian rhythms were used as dependent variables in regression analyses. The predictors used were length of day, marital status, amount of physical exercise, age, neuroticism, extroversion, and eveningness. Age, day length, marital status, and physical exercise explained the acrophase adaptation of the melatonin rhythm after westward flight, and day length, neuroticism, and extroversion after eastward flight.

Personnel with high defense mechanisms had significantly more attenuation of the 8-12 Hz activity during stimulus exposure than low defenders, implying an increased level of cortical activation.

Most of these human errors involve the ineffective use of team process factors, which are often referred to as Crew Resource Management (CRM) skills in the commercial aviation literature (Helmreich & Foushee, in press). In addition to these applied concerns, a revised version of McGrath's (1964) theory of group performance (Foushee & Helmreich, 1988) suggests that one must analyze the process (i.e., team process) by which a group's inputs (e.g., personality, attitudes) are transformed into group outcomes (e.g., task performance, mission safety) in order to understand how a task-oriented group functions. Therefore, team process attracts theoretical as well as practical interest.

The work environment must support individual creativity in order to allow for professional growth. If managers start with the conviction that their jobs will be complete when they have adequately trained each of their subordinates to replace them, then the managers become truly effective. The process of playing one subordinate against the other is ineffective. Successful managers of pilots learn to identify and build on individual interests and strengths. There must be no hidden agendas. When pilots feel important, valued, trusted, and supported, they can become indispensable members of the team. © 1992 WordPerfect Publishing Corporation."

They chose referents for sentences referring to a protagonist or minor character mentioned 1 sentence (recent character) or 3 sentences (distant character) before this target sentence. All groups chose referents less accurately for sentences about distant and minor characters than about recent and protagonist characters, perhaps because these referents were less likely to be in working memory. Young readers and pilots were more accurate for distant and minor character target sentences in aviation narratives, and recalled aviation narratives more accurately. Expertise did not reduce age differences. Expertise differences may reflect decreased demands on working memory capacity, and age declines may reflect reduced capacity."

A perception exists that SERGRADS have more difficulties than newly designated pilots during subsequent training in the Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS). A preliminary inquiry at the F/A-18 FRS revealed that former SERGRADS appear to experience a higher rate of failure on their initial carrier qualification attempt during FRS training. This study examined the SERGRAD experience and compared their performance to trainees from other sources. Although significant differences were found between groups for Fleet Replacement Squadron flight grades and Training Command composite grades, no significant differences were found between the groups for Training Command carrier qualification grades or Fleet Replacement Squadron carrier qualification.

In the United Kingdom, training a fast-jet pilot costs an estimated Σ3 million and takes 3 years. Consequently, it is necessary that the training success rate be maximal, since failure not only represents financial loss but also wastage of human resources. Effective selection for flying training would be of special advantage at present, as the operational repertoire of military aircraft moves forwards. Personality- based selection appears to have limited value. Analysis of certain objective aptitude tests and monitoring of the learning curve appear more promising. The alternative of acquisition of flying skills through actual or simulated flying experience seems an expensive option. This paper reviews the development of selection methods and concentrates on those of current interest. Civilian aviation and other professional selection systems might also benefit from the military endeavors. The most exciting development is the linkage of computer technology and aptitude tests."

A review of terminology is undertaken to present the reader with the distinguishing features of the personality disorder versus the anxiety disorder. The anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, is incompatible with safe performance of aviation duties. Obsessive-compulsive personality, on the other hand, describes a point on a continuum where useful, adaptive compulsive traits may become abnormally exaggerated and maladaptive, thus interfering with the aviator's normal routine, occupational functioning, relationships with others, and aviation safety."

Interest has been shown in the possibility of adding a brief ''mini-mental exam,'' or a simple automated test-battery to the standard flight medical to screen for such conditions. The research reported here involved the empirical evaluation of two ''mini-mental exams,'' two paper-and-pencil test batteries, and a prototype version of an automated screening battery. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated for each sub-task in a discriminant study of 54 pilots and 62 individuals from a heterogeneous clinical population. Results suggest that the ''mini-mental exams'' are poor candidates for a screening test. The automated battery showed the best discrimination performance, in part because of the incorporation of dual-task tests of divided attention performance. These tests appear to be particularly sensitive to otherwise difficult-to-detect cognitive impairments of a mild or subtle nature. The use of an automated battery of tests as a screening instrument does appear to be feasible in principle, but the practical success of a screening program is heavily dependent upon the actual prevalence of cognitive impairment in the medical applicant population."

A significantly greater number of instructor pilots was found among a cluster which comprised the smallest percentage of pilots in the sample. Overall, the results support the notion that no one type of personality is a prerequisite for success in military aeronautics, and highlight the need for additional studies of personality type in military and commercial aviation, using more sophisticated measures of aeronautical adaptability."

The goal of the research presented in this article is to isolate subgroups of pilots along performance-related personality dimensions and to document limits on the impact of crew coordination training between the groups. Two samples of military pilots were surveyed in the context of training in crew coordination. Three different profiles were identified through cluster analysis of personality scales.

We obtained the non-aviator data from published studies of other investigators who used similar procedures with the same widely used, commercially available apparatus (Nicolet CST 2000). In addition to this comparison, we correlated the pilots' CS with their air-to-air target detection distances measured during air combat maneuver training and to their night carrier landing performance scores. The major findings were: 1) The mean CS of the aviators and the non-aviators were within ±1.0 S.D. of each other in most instances, and those few instances where a greater difference was found were parsimoniously explained by methodological and procedural factors; 2) sensitivities to different spatial frequencies were highly correlated among themselves, indicating much redundancy among the measurements; 3) there was no evidence of a relationship between CS and air-to-air target detection distances or night carrier landing performance."

Seventeen USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) cases involving marital distress were reviwed, using a standardized format. Duration of martial discord ranged from 1-10 years with an average of 2.25 years. The most frequent problem noted was one of communication, with authoritarian or controlling styles predominating. The second most frequent conflict concerned occupational demands; both pilots and spouses complained about frequent work-related separations. Nine of ten distressed outcomes (i.e., separated or divorced) were initiated by the wife. We speculate that a pilot with an inflexible communication style who is not cognizant of his or her spouse's emotional needs is likely to exacerbate marital problems. The notion that marital distress may adversely affect a pilot's attention, generating performance decrements, underscores the importance of investigating elements of marital harmony in the pilot population.

We believe that this lack of mental preparedness is another aspect of the word 'complacency.' Captain Caesar also informed us that 25% of all accidents were caused by active failures which means 'conscious deviation from rules and SOP's without sound justification.' That is not complacency. It is consciously performed undisciplined flying. The opposite, however, unconscious keeping of rules and SOP's without sound justification, is complacency. In that case, you can crash due to a misprint!! We define complacency as a mental state where a pilot acts, unaware of actual danger or deficiencies. He still has the capacity to act in a competent way - but for some reason or another, this capacity is not activated. He has lost his guard without knowing it. If an accident occurs, the behavior is often characterized as self-sufficient and overconfident. This is an effect of what in social psychology is known as 'the fundamental attribution error,' which is our general inclination to perceive the behavior of others as stemming primarily from personal dispositions. However, the acting pilot himself never feels that way. In fact, most complacent behavior will pass unnoticed, since the situation did not call for extraordinary actions. But, sometimes we can see tragic effects of complacent behavior. Authors describes complacency as it related to flight safety in his article."

Respondents included 1 group of 212 pilots who were employed by an airline company with a history of corporate instability; and 2 groups, totalling 220 pilots, who were employed by 2 airline carriers with histories of corporate stability. The pilot group employed by the airline with a history of corporate instability reported significantly more stress and depression symptoms and a greater accumulation of symptoms than did the pilot groups employed by the stable airlines. With the advent of airline deregulation and its concomitant changes in the airline industry, including corporate instability, we conclude that the relationship between corporate instability within the aviation environment and the subjective distress reported by pilots suggests the need for further investigation into implications for health and safety."

A total of 37 respondents completed questionnaires which reported the presence of intrusive, avoidant, depressive/anxious, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Spouses reported more symptoms after the accident than their flying husbands. Intrusive symptoms were most common. Symptoms were correlated with various perceptions and experiences occurring prior to and following the accident. Several kinds of symptoms and experiences were significantly correlated with a perception of morale decline. This study suggests that even non-fatal aircraft accidents may have important psychological effects on those involved and on the surrounding community. Implications of these findings and recommendations for helping communities process traumatic events are discussed."

The Royal Air Force (RAF) Institute of Aviation Medicine (IAM) has investigated the psychology of such error since the early 1970s, and to this end has used two principal techniques. The first has involved assisting in the official inquiries into both RAF and civil flying accidents, and the second has involved setting up a reporting system that permits any commercial pilot to report his own everyday errors, in complete confidence, to the RAF IAM. The latter system possesses the clear benefit of gathering error data untainted by considerations of culpability, and sometimes permits system rectification before the occurrence of accidents. This paper examines selected examples of errors associated with the design of equipment and with the social psychology of crews, and suggests that some consideration of the psychology of organizations may be necessary to ensure that the problems of human error are given the degree of consideration they require."
"The 'problem' with automation: inappropriate feedback and interaction, not 'over-automation'.","1990","Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025705911&partnerID=40&md5=3f6263655199fa7869461d8bde293b37","As automation increasingly takes its place in industry, especially high risk industry, it is often blamed for causing harm and increasing the chance of human error when failures do occur. I propose that the problem is not the presence of automation, but rather its inappropriate design. The problem is that the operations under normal operating conditions are performed appropriately, but there is inadequate feedback and interaction with the humans who must control the overall conduct of the task. When the situations exceed the capabilities of the automatic equipment, then the inadequate feedback leads to difficulties for the human controllers. The problem, I suggest, is that the automation is at an intermediate level of intelligence, powerful enough to take over control that used to be done by people, but not powerful enough to handle all abnormalities. Moreover, its level of intelligence is insufficient to provide the continual, appropriate feedback that occurs naturally among human operators. This is the source of the current difficulties. To solve this problem, the automation should either be made less intelligent or more so, but the current level is quite inappropriate. The overall message is that it is possible to reduce error through appropriate design considerations. Appropriate design should assume the existence of error, it should continually provide feedback, it should continually interact with operators in an effective manner, and it should allow for the worst situations possible. What is needed is a soft, compliant technology, not a rigid, formal one."

Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli."

Items were chiefly about life events, hobbies, humour, and characteristics which might bear on susceptibility to 'pilot error' accidents. Sets of items were compiled which discriminated whether or nor respondents had had an aircraft accident in the past 10 years. Around 70% of the respondents could be classified correctly according to the self-reported accident criterion. Somewhat over half the items were significant accident markers in at least one of four pilot-license categories examined. There was surprisingly little evidence of a 'macho' syndrome associated with aircraft accidents; for example, participation in relatively risky hobbies was often negatively related to accident history. This report, like much past research, is entirely retrospective, so that some significant accident markers may only reflect accident aftereffects. Since the questionnaire was not anonymous, however, a follow-up study on the prediction of future accidents is feasible and is being considered."

Subjects recorded all sleep and nap times, rated nightly sleep quality, and completed personality inventories. Rectal temperature, heart rate, and wrist activity were continuously monitored. Adjustment was slower after the return eastward flight than after the outbound westward flight. The easward flight produced slower readjustment of sleep timing to local time and greater interindividual variability in the patterns of adjustment of sleep and temperature. One subject apparently exhibited resynchronization by partition, with the temperature rhythm undergoing the reciprocal 15-h delay. In contrast, average heart rates during sleep were significantly elevated only after westward flight. Interindividual differences in adjustment of the temperature rhythm were correlated with some of the personality measures. Larger phase delays in the overall temperature waveform (as measured on the 5th day after westward flight) were exhibited by extraverts, and less consistently by evening types."

A charter airline carrying 248 soldiers home from peacekeeping duties in the Sinai Desert crashed after a refueling stop, killing all on board. After the crash, Army family assistance workers were appointed to help the surviving family members of each dead soldier. While substantial attention has been paid to the impact of sudden disasters on survivors and bereaved relatives, little is known about the health risks to those who perform helper roles. This study aimed to: A) identify the major stress areas for disaster family assistance workers; b) examine the relation between degree of exposure to these stressors and health; and c) locate risk factors, or resistance resources that might modulate any ill effects of exposure. A survey instrument assessed duration and intensity of family-helping activities and psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms, major illness indicators, and social and personality variables at 6 months after the crash and again at the 1-year point for 131 family assistance officers. Results indicate a dose-response effect between exposure measured at time 1 and well-being, symptoms, and illness at time 2. Analysis of covariance findings also show that social supports (work supervisors, family, and friends) modulate the effects of exposure on symptoms and well-being. Social supports and the personality style of hardiness (or dispositional resilience) interact to modulate the effects of exposure on illness. These results demonstrate: A) a delayed negative impact of helper stress on family assistance workers, and b) a protective function of social supports and personality hardiness. Further research in this area should thus consider the potential influence of social/situational variables and personality dispositions in coping with disaster helper stress. © 1989 by The Williams & Wilkins Co."

Seven male volunteers,enrolled in an instrument flight rule (IFR) aviation course at the University of Illinois, participated in the study. The student pilots flew a series of IFR flight missions in a single-engine, fixed-based simulator. In dual-task conditions subjects were also required to discriminate between two tones differing in frequency and to make an occasional overt response. ERPs time-locked to the tones, subjective effort ratings, and overt performance measures were collected during two separate 45-min flights differing in difficulty. The difficult flight was associated with high subjective effort ratings, as well as increased deviations from the command altitude, heading, and glideslope. The P300 component of the ERP discriminated among levels of task difficulty, decreasing in amplitude with increased task demands. Within-flight demands were examined by dividing each flight into four segments: takeoff, straight and level flight, holding patterns, and landings. The amplitude of the P300 was negatively correlated with deviations from command headings across the flight segments.

Depending on the risk factor involved, high scorers on these psychosocial risk predictors incurred from 80% to 252% more future accidental injuries and from 38% to 69% wore future total morbidity over a 27-month follow-up period than the men in the low scoring groups. Moreover, coworkerrated amicability, probably an indication of the amount of social support available to an individual, was significantly protective against these outcome variables, with the rarely or never chosen group experiencing 60% more total morbidity and 174% more injuries than the often chosen group. A multiple-regression equation revealed that stress, amicability, type A, and satisfaction with management had an additive effect on the outcome variables. Work- and non-work-related life change distress subscales were similar in their ability to predict later morbidity. Prediction was stronger for 27-month follow-up than for only the first 9-month period.

A review of associated birth order, personality theory, industrial business psychology, aerospace, and psychoanalytic literature is presented. Highlighted are the difficulties inherent in examining the motivation of a healthy, well-defended population.

Various arrangments of motor response (vocal, hand) and HDD images were used. In the first experiment, vocal and manual response times were recorded in a current fighter aircraft mock-up situation. The shortest times were obtained for voice responses. The time elapsed between a HUD signal and the simple response to the HDD was approximately 1600 ms. The time for physical transition where accomodation changes occur was 700 ms. In the second experiment, two types of images were displayed on the HDD: a 'positive' contrast (green symbol on black background), and a 'negative' contrast (black symbol on green background) in order to compare accommodation to structured and unstructured backgrounds. Perception time was significantly shorter for the 'positive' contrast, and transition times were similar to those measured in the first experiment. This method permits the evaluation in a dynamic aeronautical environment of the acquisition and processing of information. Changes in psychological conditions (heavier information processing) and/or physiological conditions (changing accomodation, gaze axis, convergence) can be evaluated in future research."

We did this for four dominant wavelengths each at five saturation levels. Our subjects were tested at low, medium, and high adaptation levels for both large and small test stimulus sizes. In general, our results for the low luminance color matching conditions are in agreement with the published literature. For the high luminance and small field conditions, our data suggest that color discrimination should not be predicted from the 1960 CIE Uniform Chromaticity Space data.

In the Land of the Rising Sun, aerospace has somewhat of a split personality. Major 'splits' include the discrete separation between scientific- and applications-oriented space work. Split responsibilities likewise characterize the overseeing of aviation projects. Through licensed manufacturing of US products such as the F-15 fighter, and by drawing upon their highly motivated workforce and a tradition of excellence in aircraft design, the Japanese are diligently building a solid foundation in modern aircraft technologies. An almost obsessive hunger for high-tech knowledge - from design to production - supercharges the Japanese, and to gain it they are willing to play the role of humble student. But in a number of electronics-related areas, they are no longer neophytes and may soon shed that image in aerospace as well. Despite the fragmentation and Byzantine administrative network, Japan's domestic aircraft production has more than doubled since 1980 from 1. 144 billion to 2. 355. The end of the decade may be a time for certain trends described in this paper to coalesce and mold the many government agencies and companies into a mighty Western-style aerospace complex."

It was found that self-perceived poor performance was associated with job-related factors such as fatigue and anxiety about required courses, performance checks, and insufficient flying time, particularly among older pilots. Job dissatisfaction was predicted by lack of career opportunities, poor organizational climate and morale, and lack of autonomy at work, together with some domestic stressors (e.g., family health). Overall mental ill-health was found to be associated with lack of autonomy at work, fatigue, and flying patterns, together with an inability to relax and a lack of social support. © 1985 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine."

Pilot judgment, however, traditionally has been viewed as an intrinsic quality or a by-product of flying experience. Only recently has it been examined as a potential flight-training requirement. Over the past 10 years, initial steps have been taken in Canada and in the United States to validate the effectiveness of pilot judgment training. In this study, the judgment skills of Canadian civilian air cadets who received judgment training both in the classroom and in flight while earning a private pilot license were compared with the skills of a control group of cadets who received conventional training. The judgment skills of all subjects were measured during short, well-structured cross-country 'observation flights'. The results indicate that those subjects who had received judgment training averaged fewer decisional errors than did their counterparts who had received the standard training only.

This number is too small for any sort of statistical analysis, but one emerging theme has clinical importance. A significant number of male fliers tend to see these female fliers in stereotyped roles - mother, potential sexual partner, little sister, daughter - and then respond to the assigned role rather than to a real person. Whether a woman accepts this projected role as egosyntonic or rejects it as egodystonic, its existence may affect her real-life role. For example, one woman pilot reported that her instructors seemed to make allowances for her sex by expecting less of her than they did of her male colleagues, 'carrying' her along as if she were a little sister. While such role-casting may be carried on subconsciously, its behavioral manifestations are real and may have the potential for affecting flight safety. This study represents an initial approach to the data in this area, and is intended to alert flight surgeons to the implications of such role-casting in the flight environment."

Psychological well-being has been a popular research topic recently and has been shown to relate to mental health. The analysis of distinct population groups offers unique opportunities for the investigation of the interplay of the psychological, social, and physical elements of health. This study characterizes the psychological wellbeing of a unique, high stress occupational group, United States Air Force fliers (pilots and navigators). Data were obtained from a cross-sectional “Health Survey” of male fliers and nonfliers with 2485 respondents. Mental health was ascertained with an index of psychological well-being (PWB). Additionally, other data relevant to health status were collected. Results of the Alameda County, California, survey of PWB were also used for comparison. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression. Fliers were found to have significantly better PWB than nonfliers; this finding is in accord with clinical folklore regarding differences between fliers and nonfliers. Both Air Force groups had better PWB than that reported for Alameda County. There were no significant differences between pilots and navigators and no differences between pilots of different types of aircraft, results which contradict previous anecdotal reports. Young (age 21 to 28) active pilots were found to be a distinct group with significantly better PWB than any other group. Several variables made small but statistically significant contributions to explaining the variance in PWB. The best correlates of PWB were better self-reported overall health, lack of perceived time pressure, more competitive behavior, and a positive attitude toward physical fitness. The results are discussed in terms of the flier selection process, the intrinsic differences in those who select flying as a vocation, and the interaction of the flier’s developmental stage and his environment. © 1983 by The Williams & Wilkins Co."

In order to evaluate the possible neuropsychiatric sequale of such long‐term occupational exposure, we examined 30 workers exposed at about 250 mg/m3 for 4—32 years at a jet motor factory. They were compared with two control groups (2 × 30) of matched non‐exposed workers. The medical history was first assessed by standardized interviews and examination of medical records kept by the factory physician. The exposed subjects had, after their employment, much more often saught medical advice because of emotional dysfunctions, such as depression and anxiety, than had the control groups (P < 0.005). When the prevalent mental symptoms, indicative of brain lesion, later were rated by psychiatrists, the exposed workers scored higher than did the controls (P < 0.001). 14 subjects showing most symptoms were then selected for a thorough neuropsychiatric clinical investigation comprising psychosocial inquiries, psychological testing, personality assessment and neurological/neurophysiological examinations. Seven were judged to suffer from mild organic brain syndrome (i.e. “organic neurasthenia”) of which one subject was a severe case. The subjects had all undergone a slow but steady personality change over the years — starting from an ordinary strength without neurotic traits and moving towards an asthenic state with fatigue, anxiety and vegetative hyperreactivity. No other cause for this change could be identified as an alternative to the occupational exposure to jet fuel. It is concluded that personality changes and emotional dysfunctions are the foremost effects of such long‐term exposure to petroleum products. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved"

This danger has been demonstrated not only experimentally but also in a number of aircraft accident investigation reports. As new aircraft become available to the commercial, military, and private sectors and pilots consequently must transition from older to newer models, the phenomenon of negative transfer becomes increasingly significant. To illustrate the concept of negative transfer and aviation, the author compares the cockpits of two USAF aircraft and how their differences could adversely affect pilot performance. Recommendations are then made on ways organizational flight surgeons can minimize the negative transfer threat to aviation."

Optical information often takes the form of invariant properties of a changing optic array, and functional invariants are defined as psychologically effective optical invariants. Their effectiveness is determined by empirical test, but standard experimental paradigms are shown to be inappropriate for testing the effectiveness of information-rich displays. This is due to the presence of inherent and unavoidable confounding factors that are here termed 'secondary independent variables' in contradistinction in the 'primary independent variables' manipulated by the experimenter. Recommendations for a new methodology and statistical treatment are offered, and the implications for aviation psychology are discussed."

During a flight shift the health state of helicopter pilots varies via three stages: habituation, initial decline and distinct lassitude, with the latter developing after 5 h flight load. In order to increase human reliability in the pilot-helicopter system, it is advisable to allow 4 h flight time during a flight shift or board helicopters of the above type. In this case the pilot exposure to vibration effects will also be limited. The paper describes a maximally permissible spectrum of vibration velocity for a 4 h exposure."

A satisfactory technique for the investigation of human error type accidents and incidents has not yet been standardized. This paper describes a comprehensive procedure which has been designed to assess human behaviour in instances of aircraft accidents and incidents. The aim of such a human factors investigation is to understand why the accident or incident occurred and so lead to a better understanding of human error, and as a result enhance flight safety.The use of questionnaires and interviews to assess the subjective data available is discussed, and it is recommended that the most appropriate technique for the assessment of behavioural data is the use of an interview together with a check list. The importance of an early interview with all personnel associated with an accident or an incident by a human factors specialist trained in interviewing techniques is emphasized.The check list described has been developed after reviewing the relevant literature and has been modified by personal experience derived from the investigation of Army aircraft accidents and incidents in which human factors have played an important part. The check list is based on a systems approach to understanding human error and includes such headings as ‘stress’ (including life events), ‘fatigue’, ‘arousal’ and ‘personality’. It is hoped that further improvements will be made to the check list to enable it to be used not only within the specific area of aircraft accidents and incidents, but also within the broader context of any accidents which may be attributed to human errors and as a result reduce the number of accidents and identify areas where further research may be useful. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Five areas are examined: the use by the psychiatrist of the authority delegated by the social system, issues of confidentiality, efforts of the social system to influence the psychiatrist's findings, the requirements to make decisions in areas where scientific data is lacking, and the physician's imperative to 'do no harm' to his patient. Recommendations to minimize the impact of these factors through recognition, open discussion, and thoughtful structuring of the physician-patient relationship are made."

The perceived loudness of a noise is the most important acoustic parameter influencing annoyance and complaints, and the simple dBA unit can be used to integrate spectral characteristics of complex sounds in community studies. Although energy averaging such as L(eq) or L(dn) can be used to describe multiple noise exposures over time, the variable trade-off relationships between number and level of exposures are somewhat obscured by such summary measures. However, they are still the best available descriptors and, until more accurate ones are developed, can be used to measure community noise environments. Perception of an identical noise exposure can vary according to the physiological noise sensitivity of a person and the activity context in which the noise is heard. Although the acoustic quality of the noise itself usually explains about 10 to 25% of the variability in annoyance responses, sociopsychological variables measured in field studies account for 35 to 50% of the variations in human annoyance responses. Three of the most important nonacoustic factors are the connotative fear effects of the noise signal, the feeling that those responsible for the noise are misfeasant in not reducing the noise, and the feeling that harmful health effects are produced by the noise. When residents report great fear, a high misfeasance, and marked health effects, about 90% report a high annoyance level whether their noise exposure level is above 90 L(dn) or 65 to 70 L(dn). In contrast, if the feelings are a low fear level, a low degree of misfeasance, and minimal health effects, only 3 to 10% give high annoyance responses. Complaint behavior, although based on intensity of annoyance, is modified by a number of other sociopsychological factors and often is an unreliable indicator of an environmental problem."

A good number of the subjects under consideration has shown a professional capability which is still sufficiently valid - due to the experience achieved in many years of flying service and the practically total absence of emotional - affective disturbing factors - in spite of presenting a lack in the sensory, noetic and proficiency spheres, which varies from one subject to the next. On the other hand, other aged pilots (but they are a minority) have shown, in addition to the above-mentioned insufficiency, a more or less marked diminuition of the synthetic capabilities of the mind. A diminished professional ability is noted in subjects with more or less marked psychopathologic modifications in the emotional sphere, indirect deficit in the 'productive-synthetic' mind.

Firstly, that male nurses tend to prefer the more technological or administrative aspects of nursing and secondly, that they exhibit to an unusually high degree what are commonly thought of as being amongst the more feminine personality traits. The sample consisted of 91 male RAF nurses working in RAF hospitals, and was of predominantly English nationality. Of the 39 SRNs in the sample 65‐8% preferred general nursing to the more technical areas such as intensive care, operating theatre, orthopaedic and renal. The preference for general nursing was even greater, 76‐1%, amongst the 30 SENs surveyed. The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and a Level of Aspiration Test (LOA) were used to obtain measures of the personality traits of the sample. The scores obtained showed that the male RAF nurses were significantly less psychotic than male civilian nurses, male civilians or servicemen of similar age. They were also significantly less extraverted than servicemen as a whole and significantly more stable than the male civilian norm. A comparison of SRNs with SENs revealed only two significant differences. The SRNs were significantly less extraverted and had a significantly higher level of aspiration than the SENs.

With the aim of preventing and reducing such flight accidents, it is very important for pilots to have a precise knowledge of the possible illusory phenomena appearing during flight as well as to be cognisant of their forecast and, finally, to be aware and be able to apply immediately adequate preventive measures enabling them to avoid the loss of orientation during the various flight conditions. Therefore the author has examined the most frequent circumstances and conditions which, during the aerial navigation on aircrafts - not only at fixed wing but also at rotating wing - may facilitate the pilot in his spatial disorientation favoring the occurrence of mental conflict when there is a sensorial incongruity amongst the various erroneous sensations coming from the vestibular apparatus and or from the perceptive organs and an inadequate visual information. Possible measures in preventing and in neutralising them adequately - if they have already been applied - are discussed. The acquired knowledge of such conditions may contribute to inspire on the pilot a well based confidence on his own flight capability even when he may only be aided by the board instruments and under any flight conditions. The actuation of such measures and the spread of this knowledge in the Air Force are to be considered as useful and indispensable means for the prevention of aeroplane accients due to the human factor, as well as for the realization of an even more efficient safety during flights."

Review of the pilot's history reflected a perfectionist attitude since childhood with continuous associated near-serious accidents. Flight training revealed occurrences of over-correction, channelized attention, and denial of errors.

These activities included sport-parachuting (sky diving). The program was carried out with the special methods and techniques of social group work. Sky diving was one of the means used as a therapy to place neurotic juveniles with behavior disorders under stress, and also relieve them of such stress. It was our intention to observe the development of social interaction within the group of juveniles. The change of individual and social behavior was empirically observed over 4 1/2 years by sociometry and observation of 10 relevant items. The evaluation of the items reflected sympathy and antipathy, which were analyzed. Changes in interpersonal relations were repeatedly verified, compared and discussed. The dynamic and structural interaction was complemented by casuistry. There were additional considerations, such as how proper interpersonal attitudes, abilities and behavior could be improved so as to deepen ties and create stability. The insight into inter-human relations opens new psychological horizons for the thoughtful social worker, psychiatrist etc., as to where and why special methods are necessary in the field of special education. It was our intention to find new educational means of modifying social behavior, thus reducing juvenile delinquency. Through these special educational methods, we hope to improve physical fitness as well as the conditions under which therapy is conducted. Parallel to that the educational role of the social worker or psychiatrist can be observed and controlled with the aim of avoiding the damaging effects of prejudices and personal insufficiencies. The results were obtained in three main-research phases, conducted under identical conditions at intervals of 5 1/2 months and 4 1/2 years. Sympathies and antipathies were investigated through a criterion (question regarding sky diving) complemented by 10 items. Simultanously with the evaluation of the rating scale, choices as to sympathy and antipathy were made, according to a modification of the French and Mensh pattern."

Articulation functions obtained on four normally hearing listeners tested under the same conditions as the pilots revealed that, for situations when little or no attenuation was available (loudspeaker and one headset), greater signal-to-noise ratios were necessary to allow discrimination equivalent to that obtained under conditions of greater noise attenuation (two headsets). Although good intelligibility could be achieved through the loudspeaker given sufficient signal intensity (>100 dB SPL) some pilots preferred lower levels even though discrimination was reduced."

In the USA, several European countries and Japan, numerous sociological studies have been carried out among persons living near airports to determine the effects of aircraft noise on human subjects. The findings show that this noise predominantly impairs communication (especially conversation) and recreation (i.e. the capacity to relax at home). Judged by the criteria of social, psychic and somatic well-being, it imposes a severe stress on those concerned. However, the reactions to aircraft noise are attributable only in part to acoustic noise stress; extra-acoustic factors-environmental situation and personality characteristics-also play a part. For this reason, but also because of inadequate planning of housing estates, the imposition of (acoustically defined) limits on aircraft noise will at best result in a partial protection from the consequences of aircraft noise as an environmental factor."

A refinement in affective stress analysis has enabled two subtypes of stress to be demonstrated: one is characterized by activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and subjective feelings of rage, fear, anxiety, or frustration; the other by excessive rumination. These two subtypes are found in differing personality configurations. Ten pilots exhibiting the former type of stress, and 6 with the latter, sought personal counselling regarding domestic problems. They underwent a regimen of 1 h weekly sessions consisting of a psychometric assessment, a psychophysiological evaluation of stress, and a complex ILS task in a specially modified type D4 Link Trainer. The performance of both groups, in terms of deviations from zero and RT to cockpit drill, was found to differ significantly from the standardized norms obtained from control groups in earlier studies, and to differ significantly from each other. The SNS aroused group showed maximum impairment at the beginning of the 20 min flight task, but gradually improved with time. The Ruminative group showed less, but consistent, impairment throughout the task. Overcontrolling was a characteristic of the former group, while errors of omission characterized the latter. The psychology of rumination is briefly mentioned, its incidence in pilots considered, and reference made to the beneficial effects of sodium diphenylhydantoinate for this condition."

Mechanical failures as causative factors are 10-20%. The biomedical factors of fatalities include use of drugs and alcohol in order to cope with a possible stress, anxiety, or frustration in the aircraft. The important role of personality factors in producing stress reactions requires that stress be defined in terms of transactions between individuals and situations, rather than of either in isolation. When stress reactions are observed, it is assumed that these were brought about by stress conditions, and the accident investigator looks for them in order to understand the reaction which leads to the accident. In the field of fatal accident investigation, where the causes of the event must be sought retrospectively (that is, by looking back and reconstructing the antecedent conditions) the investigator usually assumes that the victim must have encountered severe stress to which the behavior represents a response. Since there are variations in reaction patterns in different individuals under different instances of stress, this issue turns us back to consideration of intervening processes and conditions. An individual's behavior is dependent upon the total effect of all the psychosocial variables that went into the making of this individual's life style."

This activation did not depend only on the actual task, but also on the experience level of the pilot himself.

Moreover the author considers these various categories somewhat artificially contrived, for they often mistake the effects for the causes. The distribution of these various 'causes' for failures may be modified fairly appreciably by a psycho pedagogically directed action. A brief review of the various modes of expressing lack of adjustment to the aviation environment suggests the need for a clear knowledge of some data. For instance, in medically expressed disorders discrimination between psychic and organic causes must be discarded and replaced by a more dynamic psychosomatic concept which will take into account the flying environment per se. Whatever the modes expressing adjustment disorders, their common character is their occurrence in the flying situation which is the source of a specific type of anxiety, flight induced anxiety. So the question arises of the involvement of various defense mechanisms. Briefly, 3 major lines of release from flight induced anxiety can be described: behavioral, 'mentalized' and somatized lines; along each line various defense mechanisms can be detected. On the value and efficiency of these mechanisms rests the subject's adjustment. Besides a technical progression in flying skills, there is an emotional and affective one which, to a high degree, conditions failure or success."

Results indicate that female pilots have a distinctive EPPS personality profile. As compared to norms established for U.S. adults, the EPPS means of female pilots are more similar to those of male adults than female adults. Moreover, the EPPS personality profile of female pilots is more similar to the male general aviation pilot profile than to either the adult female or the adult male norms. Female pilots and male pilots deviate in the same direction from means of the EPPS female norms on 15 of the 16 scales. Thus, female pilots have more personality traits in common with male pilots than they have with women in the U.S. population at large.

The needs that were explored were those of the Maslow hierarchy, including physiological, safety, and security, social, self esteem, and self actualization needs. Eighty seven aviation officer candidates were given a questionnaire designed to measure optimism, relevance, and importance in terms of the five needs described above. They were given the test initially on the third day after entering the program (Time I), and then again after 9 weeks of training (Time II). The results indicate that DORs differ from completers in their evaluation of how well their needs are satisfied. Within the first 9 weeks of training, DORs indicated that meeting their needs was more 'important', though they were less 'satisfied' and optimistic' than completers, particularly with regard to the self actualization need."

A consideration of enlistee personality and interests might refine this job placement system. To determine if personality differences exist among 108 male career officers in selected Air Force specialties, Ss were given the Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI). The specialties were compared further by means of the Environmental Assessment Technique (EAT). Significant differences among the specialties of electronics technician, administrative specialist, inflight refueling operator specialist, and security policeman were found on VPI Realistic, Intellectual, Self-Control, and Status scales. In general, the EAT did not differentiate among the specialties. Implications for counselors of prospective and enlisted airmen are drawn.

The history of the subject matter is briefly critically reviewed, with particular reference to British surveys of 1961 and 1967. Experimental suggestions are made as to the survey planning and data analysis. An attempt is made to explain the lack of correlation between the physical and psychosocial data, by attributing it to the impossibility of obtaining reliable uniform data on human behavior. Another approach is based on consideration of complaints. Complaints against aircraft noise correlate numerically with the number of aircraft movements at the airport. Complaints tend to come however from the articulate, affluent house holders and therefore do not represent a random sample of the population. Aircraft noise interferes primarily with such activities as conversation, sleep and TV watching. Should the annoyance exceed a certain level a legitimate question of possible effects prejudicial to health arises. The difficulties in defining the acceptable day and night noise levels and the political nature of the noise problem are stressed."

Interesting results: About 99% of the candidates in category A, who passed both the preliminary psychotechnical exam and the final medical test, were accepted as pilots after one year's training whereas, for category B, only 25% passed the final pilot's examination. To sum up, for the proper selection of pilot applicants: It is advisable to give 'pilot cadet' applicants a preliminary psychotechnical test before they sit for the final medical examination. It is necessary to 'standardize' universally the psychotechnic examination methods and adopt the 'same marking' in different categories A, B, C, and D. The choice of successful candidates in category A alone, or the two categories A and B, would depend on each country's actual requirements at the time of recruitment. In order not to waste time, it is a good thing not to make candidates sit for 'duplicata tests' which may be held during both the psychotechnical examination and the medical examination such as the measuring of visual acuity, in depth discrimination and the determining of congenital dyschromatopsia."

The results of psycho therapeutic cures carried out over a period of 4 yr allow three categories to be distinguished in this type of treatment: 1) Long cures which generally involve cases almost no different from those found in other professions, para psychotic and neurotic syndromes, the profound etiology of which can be traced to disturbances in the psycho affective development during childhood. Here the incidence of professional factors is usually rather low. 2) Short cures, which last from 2 to 6 mth, corresponding to psycho social maladjustment crises provoked either by professional difficulties or by disturbances in the subject's private life. They usually evolve towards readjustment, but the earlier level of adjustment cannot always be reached. 3) Lightning cures, which require only a few appointments, often correspond to a sharp maladjustment crisis that may be either psycho social (often with a paranoic aspect) or professional (in the right sense of the word), the subject reaching the limits of his resistance to the stresses connected with his profession. Clinical examples show the advantage of psycho therapeutic methods in the various syndromes of the psycho pathology of flight personnel."

Results for human response times were comparable in the two tests, but the field test answered other questions about consumer behavior and subjective reactions that could not be studied in the laboratory. This paper compares the test conditions and results and discusses the relative advantages of the two methods of testing for various purposes. © 1971, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Within the context of the disaster, the interaction of such factors as individual psychodynamics, small group processes, and intergroup dynamics can be examined.1 This paper deals with an existential and theoretical account of a particular disaster, the Kennedy Airport Snow-In of February, 1969, which may in some way illustrate behavioral phenomena common to events of this type. The empirical data derive from one of the authors, who was an affected passenger (C.A.H.).2 The gathering of data of a non personal nature, the integration of the collected information, and the conclusions drawn about intergroup phenomena presume a distance from the initial confusion. © 1971 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Thirty-three subjects searched 12 areas of modified sectional aeronautical charts for a total of 48 checkpoints. Identification of checkpoints was established with labels plus geographical context information. Color served as a partially redundant code for information location. In general, the findings indicate that color coding for information location is most effective when: (1) many categories of information can or must be coded, (2) colors highly discriminable in peripheral vision are used, and (3) the number of objects per category is kept reasonably small. © 1971, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Yet, aircraft operators have experienced many unexpected problems with this battery. These problems can be greatly reduced, if not eliminated, through a better understanding by the design engineer of the battery's construction, abilities, and limitations.

It was found that during regular testing conditions Ss produced inverted V-shaped gradients, i.e., stronger GSRs and longer RTs to low-intensity cues and high-intensity cues. This replicated an earlier finding with experienced parachutists. When tested under conditions of threat and uncertainty, Ss showed a reversal in their response patterns, i.e., monotonic gradients of GSR and RT to the same stimulus dimension. Monotonic gradients are consistently found for novice jumpers. It was concluded that the process responsible for the backward shift was a function of experience are reversible.

Variables included unpleasantness of the event (electrical shock), proximity of the event, and relationship of Ss’ performance to the occurrence of the event. The data support inclusion of these variables in Wherry’s model of APTS. Ss who believed they could avoid the shock by an adequate performance were able to maintain or improve that performance while the performance of Ss who perceived the shock as inevitable was deteriorating. Two possible modifications of the APTS model were discussed: (1) weighting APTS determiners according to their effectiveness in generating anticipatory stress, (2) recognizing the interaction of the APTS variables with S’s personality structure. © 1969 Journal Publishing Affiliates."

The cause of an air crash was found after 2 short. hypnosis sessions, where other orthodox methods used over a period of 2 years had failed. The method can be used in all cases of amnesia. The patient is made to hallucinate a threatening situation, and his hallucination gives a clue to the basic problem. He is then made to hallucinate a pleasant scene, which gives an indication of the method he uses to escape from the problem. This is repeated at the second session for confirmation. If the patient does not bring up the required material by free association under hypnosis, a dissociation of the personality is induced in which the observing ego watches what the experiencing ego is doing to cause the accident. The results demonstrate that in this case, at least, hypnotic techniques were more successful than sodium amytal interviews, free association, psychiatric interviews, physical and emotional isolation, pressure by authorities, and kindness of friends. Reference is made to the problems involved when the interests of the patient are in conflict with public safety. © 1969, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved."

To account for this phenomenon, a miniature theory was presented which assumed that with continuous exposure to threat, 2 developments take place, a heightening of the gradient of anxiety and the development of a gradient of inhibition of anxiety, the latter having the steeper slope.

Men experienced in the job of Naval aviation electronics technician designated 18 tasks as constituting that job at the entry levels. Supervisory personnel then judged the similarity between all pairs of these tasks. The resulting scaled similarity estimates were analyzed by standard multidimensional scaling techniques. The work performed by aviation electronics technicians at the job entry levels was perceived by supervisors as involving 4 basic dimensions. It appears to be feasible and fruitful to apply multidimensional scaling techniques to the analysis of job performance. (22 ref.)

The present study explores the possibility that judgments of damage are affected by knowledge of injury. Thirty-six male subjects estimated aircraft damage from 36 photographs of aircraft accidents. In connection with each photograph the subjects were provided with fictitious injury (as well as other) information. Accident photographs, subjects and injury levels were appropriately counterbalanced. The major hypothesis was supported. Accident-involved aircraft were given higher damage ratings when the photographs were presented with higher injury levels than when the same photographs were presented with lower injury levels.

Disasterously low final approaches, a major source of night landing accidents, have been attributed to a visual illusion involving overestimation of altitude. In order to evaluate visual performance in related tasks, subjective judgements of the altitude of a luminous horizontal bar relative to eye level were obtained in total darkness and in the presence of a peripheral artificial horizon. Errors as large as 1° visual angle, corresponding to 8 ft at a range of 500 ft from touchdown, occur frequently, indicating the inadequacy of direct visual contact unaided by artificial display devices. The dramatic reduction in variability resulting from the presence of the artificial horizon demonstrates the importance of a visual frame of reference or structure. © 1964, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

The conspicuity studies, using paired comparisons of model airplanes, gave evidence that: (a) amount of red-orange fluorescent paint coverage is positively correlated with conspicuity; (b) high brightness paints should be placed on the upper surfaces of the aircraft and low brightness paints on the lower portions; (c) maximizing brightness contrasts between different parts of the aircraft surfaces does not enhance conspicuity; (d) flight attitudes, backgrounds, lighting conditions, and differences in Ss did not affect conspicuity significantly. The attitude studies in which pilots matched the model airplanes in some 1 of 15 attitudes, with 1 of 15 models mounted on a small display, indicated that the paint patterns used did not aid the pilots in making judgments of aircraft attitude.

Four weeks later, the Bernreuter questionnaire was administered to 277 of these subjects. Results indicated: (i) The distributions of “?” scores were positively skewed, the shape approximating the J-curve. (2) The reliability for Bernreuter “?” scores was estimated as 64, for a single Guilford-Martin test as 72, for the sum from three Guilford-Martin inventories in the eighties. (3) Question-mark scores were independent of ACE scores and educational level within the restricted range studied. (4) Bernreuter and Guilford-Martin “?” scores correlated significantly, and about equally, with ten Guilford-Martin traits: GAMIN, OAgCo, and TR of Test STDCR. Subjects with many “?” responses tended to rate themselves toward the less socially approved direction on these ten traits. However, the significant correlations reported between “?” scores and personality trait scores appear to be artifacts of the scoring procedure used in Guilford-Martin inventories for the “?” response. It was concluded that independent measures of personality are needed as correlates of “?” responses in order to understand their meaning. © 1955, Sage Publications. All rights reserved."

Students' logs were evaluated for five separate missions by comparing the students' entries with standards determined by experts. The reliability of this technique is indicated by the fact that mission to mission inter-correlations of error scores were low, while the intercorrelations between legs of the same mission were moderately high. The intercorrelations between the error scores for the different navigation variables were computed and analyzed by using both factor analysis and multiple regression techniques. Both analyses indicated that a major portion of all dead reckoning error could be attributed to errors made in determining magnetic deviation. As a result of these analyses, recommendations were made for changing the instruction in dead reckoning and alterations in the equipment used were suggested. © 1947 Psychometric Society."

Two of the components, Word-Knowledge and Reasoning-in-Reading, were intensively investigated. It was found that the type of reasoning which is important in reading is not of a sort which can be measured in the usual reasoning tests, such as those of syllogistic reasoning, figure analysis, mechanical judgment, or arithmetical problems. This fact argues against the existence of a general reasoning ability. Since perceptual facility proved to be relatively unimportant in determining certain essential elements in reading, the author concludes that instruments such as the Metron-O-Scope and Ophthalmograph cannot aid a pupil's comprehension enough to warrant the expense and trouble of using them.

The public has confidence in metal. With quantity production in view, the author and his associates considered costs of production as related to quantity and also costs of maintenance at airports and in the field, and chose metal as the material of construction. Structural members are fashioned from sheet duralumin rather than from tubes and a type of construction was evolved that can be made with the minimum investment in tools, that is cheap to put together and that can be repaired with the smallest amount of equipment and labor. For compression loads, duralumin has a great deal more strength for a given weight than has steel. It cannot be used, however, for compression members in combination with steel in tension members because of the difference in coefficient of expansion. Advantage is taken of the rigidity of corrugated duralumin sheets to use them as wing covering in a way to form part of the structure and prevent torsion. Strength of metal of a given analysis and heat-treatment can be determined within 5 per cent, and all duplicate members made of the same metal have equal strength. This is not true of wood and of wooden members. Parts of a damaged metal airplane can be repaired readily with metal of the same thickness, quality and cross-section and the airplane made as good as when new. Built-up sections of metal riveted together give warning of coming failure, whereas wood and tubular members do not. The exterior of a duralumin airplane needs no painting or other protection against corrosion. The sheets used in the author's airplanes are polished before fabricating and are given no other finish."

Reference is here being made most specifically to the reaction-time experiment for one, salvaged by the workers on aviation problems. And new experiments with new techniques were fashioned and new combinations of old techniques were instituted. What experiments were designed and performed to meet the requirements attending the classification of aviators and prospective aviators in Italy, France, England, and this country during the war are admirably and extensively described by Dockeray and Isaacs in this article, the summary being an excellent review of the foreign and domestic literature on the subject. Many and exceedingly interesting results of the experiments, most of them obtained from numerous subjects, are cited, but they are too numerous and too well organized in the writers' summary to enumerate here. Two important results were the following: (1) Practically all of the best pursuit pilots belonged to the sensory reaction-time type, and exhibited a keen perception of the position of the body, low visual reaction-times, low choice reaction-times, and a low average deviation in reaction-time. Resistance to influences of emotional stimuli was not always present or necessary, some of the best pilots being quite susceptible to emotional conditions. (2) Practically all of the best slow machine, bombing, aviators were motors in reaction-time; and Caproni pilots exhibited resistance to emotional stimuli. From Psych Bulletin 18:06:00361.

These committees were involved in collecting and making available relevant psychological literature, examination of recruits, motivating the troops, treatment and re-education of incapacitated troops. A committee of seven psychologists tested out various methods during May-June 1917. Five groups of three men each were organized for examining recruits in four different military establishments, with the purpose of classifying recruits as mentally ""inferior"", ""average"", or ""superior"". The work justified itself on the practical counts of acting as aids in selection, elimination, promotion and assignment of men. The other committees also proved themselves to be of great utility in development of scales, selection of aviation cadets, identification of special abilities and reeducation.
