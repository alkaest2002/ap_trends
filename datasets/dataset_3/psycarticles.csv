"Defining competence profiles in obstetrics and gynecology using the modified requirement tracking questionnaire","","Tarasi, Baptiste; Oubaid, Viktor; Baud, David","BMC Medical Education","Scholarly Journals","","25","","2025-01-01","2025","1","","1-6","14726920","","","ENG","BackgroundData about the competencies needed for physicians in obstetrics and gynecology (O&G) is currently insufficient. The aim of this study is to define the competence profile needed in this sector for daily professional activity, in order to account for these criteria in future recruitment.MethodsThe modified requirement-tracking questionnaire (R-track) was sent to 307 physicians working in the field of O&G with different training levels and practice locations. The R-track is designed to assess professional competence profiles and contains 66 items covering the following eight competence areas: “Mental abilities”, “Social sensibility”, “Psychomotor and multitasking abilities”, “Solutions orientation”, “Social interactive competences”, “Personality traits”, “Verbal competences” and “Resistance capacity”. The mean scores of single items and competence areas were calculated. Results were compared between gender, training level, and place of practice.ResultsThe participation rate was 65.5%, with 201 physicians returning the questionnaire. In this sample, 50.2% of them were in training and 49.8% were practicing O&G specialists. The proportion of physicians working in a hospital setting was 64.7% while 30.3% worked in private practice. The competence areas “Social sensibility” and “Psychomotor & multitasking abilities” appear to be the most important for daily professional activity. At the item level, “Stress resistance”, followed by “Workload management” and “Tactfulness” were considered as the most valuable characteristics. Differences between gender, level of training, and place of practice were not significant.ConclusionThe identified competence profile could serve as a basis for developing a new method of O&G residency selection. In addition, such a profile could help medical students to decide on a professional specialization at a very early stage by comparing their personal competence profile with the one in the field or with their mentors.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3165514804?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=CmJu0wB6jPQyYvSOjv%2BHSPUmpMc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-025-06806-7"
"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Fear of Flying and Flying Habits: The Mediating Effect of Anxiety Sensitivity","","Katz, Michael","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2024-01-01","2024","","","","","","9798311920483","ENG","Background and goals:Fear of flying (FoF) is a prevalent and highly disabling phobia. Several studies have examined various aspects of the effects of COVID-19 on the aviation industry, including health and safety protocols adopted by airlines, airport authorities, and border control administrations or on travelers’ motivation to fly. Numerous recent studies have explored the effect of COVID-19 on passengers’ traveling habits and motivation to travel, with special emphasis on flying. However, very few studies, if any, examined the effects of COVID-19 on FoF, a prevalent and highly disabling phobia, among people with and without pre-existing FoF. This perspective is important because there is a high probability that the epidemic affected people with and without FoF differently, which may require different solutions for different people.The primary goal of this study was to address this lacuna in the literature by exploring the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on FoF and flying habits among a large representative sample of people from the general population, with and without pre-existing FoF. A secondary goal was to assess the degree to which anxiety sensitivity (AS) mediates this effect. The study hypothesis was that the COVID-19 pandemic would increase the overall prevalence of FoF and AS (measured as continuous variables), this effect was hypothesized to be mediated by AS, and moderating by pre-existing FoF. We also explored the extent to which pre-existing FoF moderated the indirect effect of COVID-19 on FoF via AS.Method:To test the above hypotheses, the study used a two-wave, pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19, retrospective design among a randomly selected sample of 470 participants from the general population in Israel.Results:The findings of the study provided moderate to strong support for most of the hypotheses. The study findings indicated an increased prevalence of FoF from pre-COVID19 to during the pandemic. Findings regarding the overall levels of FoF and AS were mixed, yet findings showed that COVID-19 was related to higher AS. We also found that the underlying mechanism of effects was stronger for participants without pre-existing phobias, including FoF than others.Discussion:These findings' theoretical and clinical perspectives offer new insights into the nature and causes of FoF. From an applied point of view, the findings of this study shed light on the effects of a pandemic in general, and the COVID-19 pandemic in particular.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3222572436?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=BGlFTqVbHxG7GZql7%2FUd6OHUjhY%3D",""

However, the lack of a valid and reliable instrument sensitive to the Ethiopian culture for measuring health professional practice environment leads to difficulty in constructing evaluations of safety climate and further linking organizational research to outcomes research. This research study examined the psychometric properties of the Safety Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) in the Amharic language within an Ethiopian healthcare context.MethodA hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted. The SAQ was meticulously translated into Amharic using forward and backward translation methods. Content validity was evaluated with input from seven patient safety and healthcare quality experts. Face validity was established through feedback from healthcare professionals. Then, the Amharic SAQ (SAQ-A) was distributed to 648 participants working in 11 public hospitals, and a total of 611 valid questionnaires were completed and returned (95.2% response rate). Cronbach’s alpha, McDonald’s omega, composite reliability, correlation analysis, and average variance estimation were calculated, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed. Descriptive analyses were performed to describe socio-demographic characteristics. A P-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Tables, figures, charts, and texts are used for data presentation.ResultThe overall internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for the 31-item SAQ-A was 0.903, indicating excellent reliability.

Prior research has explored the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and work engagement in various industries, but studies focusing on pilots, particularly in the business aviation industry (BAI) are lacking. This quantitative correlational-predictive study examined the extent to which EI predicts work engagement among BAI pilots in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas and whether this relationship is moderated by age, years of formal education, and years of service. The theoretical framework, grounded in literature, associates EI with enhanced work engagement and improved organizational citizenship. The study employed validated instruments to measure EI and work engagement, using moderation analysis to examine the hypotheses. Results indicate that EI significantly predicts work engagement. Age does not moderate the relationship between EI and work engagement; however, the association is moderated for years of education below 6.59 and years of service lesser than 25.48.

"Phase of Flight Differences Formed by the Cross Tabulation of Automation Disruption and Pilot Response","","Rahn, Ernest Coren","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2014-01-01","2014","","","","","","978-1-321-33770-9","ENG","The present-day state of technological development on modern commercial airliners has resulted in aircraft that have most of the customary flying tasks accomplished by automated computer systems.  The problem addressed in this study was the effect of flying automated aircraft on pilot response when automated system anomalies occur.  The purpose of this quantitative, cross tabulation study was to examine archival data acquired from the NASA's online Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) electronic database reported between June 2009 and June 2014 to determine if a significant association existed between commercial aircraft automation disruption themes, the nature of the pilot's response, and the phases of flight.  While there has been significant previous research centering on the degradation of manual piloting skills resulting from operating automated aircraft, no association had been established between automation disruption themes, the nature of pilot response, and the phases of flight.  Establishing this association required two-way contingency table analysis with cross tabulation of the research variables to statistically demonstrate significance and quantification of association.  The decisively chosen participants for this study were derived from automation-related ASRS online database incident reports submitted between June 2009 and June 2014 by commercial airline pilots.  The chi square test for significance of association statistically established a significant association between automation disruption theme and pilot response in during the takeoff phase of flight, x2  (3, N = 560) = 8.65, p < .05, the cruise phase of flight x 2 (3, N = 560) = 8.52, p < .05), and the landing phase of flight x2 (3, N = 560) 8.00, p = <.05.  Additionally, the chi square test for significance of association statistically confirmed a significant association existed between phase of flight groups and the nature of pilot response to automation disruptions x2 (2, N = 560) = 20.03, p < .05.  Detailed analysis of the results quantification demonstrated that there is a need for improved pilot-automation interaction within the commercial aviation community.  The findings of this study present regulatory agencies and aviation safety experts with supplemental contributions to the current body of knowledge, presenting additional data to develop and implement improvements into training and mitigation programs to curtail the potential negative impact of piloting highly automated aircraft.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1625419411?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=2%2B%2FVV6NiQsWDAtK%2BTlqCk6Or%2FFo%3D",""

The purpose of this exploratory sequential mixed methods study was to determine if Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) students who enroll and eventually graduate in the Aerospace Professional Pilot concentration and students who enroll in the Aerospace Professional Pilot concentration but subsequently switch to another Aerospace concentration differ in the noncognitive traits of grit and growth mindset. Grit is defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals (Duckworth, 2016), and growth mindset is defined as the belief that intelligence is not fixed and can be improved with effort and time. If students who are high in grit and growth mindset are more likely to complete training, identifying students who are high in these noncognitive traits and providing courses to enhance these traits may help alleviate the current pilot shortage. In the first quantitative phase of this mixed methods study, Angela Duckworth’s Grit-S Scale was used to measure grit (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009), and Carol Dweck’s mindset survey was used to measure growth mindset (Dweck, 2016) in MTSU Aerospace students who initially enrolled in the Professional Pilot concentration. Descriptive and inferential statistics were generated to see if there was a difference in grit and growth mindset between students who enrolled and persisted in the MTSU Aerospace Professional Pilot concentration and those who subsequently switched. Then a purposeful sample of four volunteers from each group was randomly selected to participate in the second qualitative phase of this mixed methods study to explain and clarify the results of the first phase quantitative results. Open ended questions were asked to determine if there is a difference in the educational experiences between the two groups of students. The first phase quantitative results found a significant difference in grit but no significant difference in growth mindset between the two groups.

These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots. Method: A sample of 200 pilots completed validated self-report measures: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro. Results: Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = −0.46, p< 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p< 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p< 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p< 0.01. Conclusions: Resilience emerged as both a direct and indirect buffer against psychological strain in aviation. These findings underscore the importance of promoting adaptive coping and resilience training, alongside effective fatigue management, to enhance pilot well-being and maintain safety in aviation systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3265876769?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=XgjeeNfrdVjuC%2BZVho9Ds985GcA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe15100206"

This study explores the relationship between occupational health and safety (OHS) systems and the psychological well-being of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs), focusing on factors such as perceived safety, job satisfaction, stress, and mental strain. Conducted within the Hellenic Air Navigation Services Provider, the research adopts a cross-sectional design using a structured questionnaire distributed nationwide. The study draws upon the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) theoretical framework to examine how organizational resources, such as training, clarity of role, supervisor support, and employee autonomy, interact with job demands to shape occupational outcomes. Special emphasis is placed on understanding how the presence and awareness of structured OHS systems influence ATCOs’ perceptions of safety and well-being. Our analysis indicated that participants who reported the presence of an OHS system perceived their workplace as significantly safer than those who reported no such system. Hence, the existence of structured measures allows ATCOs to feel confident in their work environment. By assessing a range of psychosocial and organizational variables, this study seeks to contribute to both the academic discourse and practical strategies aimed at improving safety culture and psychological resilience in high-risk work environments.

Our findings underscore that the human factors involved, by themselves, can yield strong predictions. As a term of comparison, other variables (type of occurrence, flight phase, and aircraft fate) were used as predictors, with poorer results; by combining these variables with human factors, the prediction is only marginally better, if at all, than that based on human factors alone.

Despite the necessity, a validated and tailored measurement tool specific to this demographic is absent. Addressing this gap, this study built on the widely used CD-RISC-25 to analyze and modify its applicability to Chinese civil aviation pilots. Utilizing CD-RISC-25 survey data from 231 Chinese pilots, correlational and differential analyses identified items 3 and 20 as incongruent with this population's resilience profile. Subsequently, factor analysis derived a distinct two-factor resilience psychological framework labeled “Decisiveness” and “Adaptability”, which diverged from the structure found in American female pilots and the broader Chinese populace. Additionally, to further accurately identify the measurement characteristics of this 2-factor measurement model, this study introduced Generalized Theory and Item Response Theory, two modern measurement analysis theories, to comprehensively analyze the overall reliability of the measurement and issues with individual items. Results showed that the 2-factor model exhibited high reliability, with generalizability coefficient reaching 0.89503 and dependability coefficient reaching 0.88496, indicating the 2-factor measurement questionnaire can be effectively utilized for relative and absolute comparison of Chinese civil aviation pilot resilience. However, items in Factor 2 provided less information and have larger room for optimization than those in Factor 1, implying item option redesign may be beneficial. Consequently, this study culminates in the creation of a more accurate and reliable two-factor psychological resilience measurement tool tailored for Chinese civil aviation pilots, while exploring directions for optimization. By facilitating early identification of individuals with lower resilience and enabling the evaluation of intervention efficacy, this tool aims to positively impact pilot psychological health and aviation safety in the context of grief and trauma following distressing events.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2917421856?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=N84fFpYXx6FAt%2BpHuGnFQYQHYbw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52229-7"

However, considerably fewer studies have investigated the effects of interruptions in memory-based procedural tasks with sequential constraints. Focusing on the performance in this type of primary task, this thesis investigates the effects of interruption length, the complexity of the interruption task, and the similarity between the primary task and the interruption task. Moreover, the potential of mnemonic acronyms to improve learning, execution, and, critically, resilience toward interruptions has also been addressed. Despite having been widely used to support the learning and execution of procedural tasks, mnemonic acronyms have not been systematically investigated for their effects on performance thus far.The results of Study A revealed that mnemonic acronyms can speed up learning of the primary task and improve resilience toward interruptions at certain positions in the procedural task. Moreover, the standard effects of interruption length were replicated. That is, we found that more time is needed to resume the primary task after a long interruption compared to a short one. Also, it is more likely that an error will be committed after a long interruption. In Study B, the results confirmed that more time is needed to resume the primary task and more errors emerge after a complex interruption task than after a simple one. At the same time, variations in similarity in terms of processing codes between the verbal primary task and the interruption tasks do not seem to play a role in resumption costs. This study also provides preliminary evidence that similarity in terms of sequential demand between the two tasks might play a role in resumption costs in a primary procedural task with sequential constraints.The results obtained are discussed in the context of the two main theories in the domain of interruption research: the Memory for Goals Theory (Altmann & Trafton, 2002) and the Prospective Memory Theory (e.g., Einstein et al., 2003). Besides, the results are also discussed in the context of other, complementary theories. Finally, implications of the results in the domains of cognitive psychology and applied psychology are also considered.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3073247334?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=LBHIgwargpl1mzr9xcm3Q%2F8xL1o%3D","https://doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-19632"

Recent research in the general population indicates a potential link between depression and oral health. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to investigate the association between self-reported oral hygiene practices and depressive symptoms among airline pilots.MethodsOne hundred actively working male airline pilots of Caucasian descent voluntarily enrolled in the study during routine occupational health visits. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Self-reported oral hygiene practices, including toothbrushing frequency and mouthwash usage, were examined. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between depressive symptoms and oral hygiene practices.ResultsTwelve pilots (12%) demonstrated mild depressive symptomatology (BDI-II scores 14-19). Pilots with mild depression reported significantly lower rates of brushing teeth twice or more per day (33.3% vs. 80.7%) and higher rates of rarely brushing (16.7% vs. 1.1%) compared to those with minimal depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). Nonuse of mouthwash was more prevalent among pilots with mild depression (66.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.008). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that pilots who rarely brushed their teeth (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 14.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3−197.9; p < 0.05) or did not use mouthwash (adjusted OR = 5.7; 95% CI = 1.4−25.2; p < 0.05) had significantly higher odds of mild depressive symptoms.ConclusionsSelf-reported oral hygiene habits may serve as a proxy indicator for mild depressive symptoms among airline pilots.

Air Traffic Controllers perform extremely demanding and challenging work, as indicated by the fact that many controllers retire before their acctual retirement with stress-related work disabilities.Stressors, applicable to air traffic controllers, were discussed to help the controller to identify his or her source of stress. It is important because stress is an everyday fact of life, which cannot be avoided but must be adjusted to. Stress is often regarded as an individual problem, however, there are characteristics of work, called “job stressors” that can cause a stress reaction in most workers.The data was collected by means of the Experience of Work and Life Circumstances Questionnaire (WLQ), that was sent to all Air Traffic Control Stations across South Africa. The questionnaire was developed to determine the levels and causes of stress of employees. The WLQ endeavours to establish whether employees experience normal, high or very high levels of stress, and also identify those factors, which cause these levels of stress. The questionnaire consists of three different parts, namely, a demographic questionnaire, experience of work which determine the levels of stress and finally, circumstances and expectations which analyse the causes of stress.It was clear from this study that for Air Traffic Controllers, uncertainty and lack of control over their own destiny and immediate circumstances, contributed to an increase in the levels of stress. It was clear that Air Traffic Controllers value their skills and want to be rewarded accordingly. Therefore, it was further demonstrated that remuneration, employee benefits and employee policies contribute substantially to the levels of stress experienced by Air Traffic Controllers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3224573430?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=vVWsBg1W4oGLt4RleXlYfA%2F2rLs%3D",""
"Rethinking Pilot Retention in the United States: An Analysis of Key Factors","","Hickey, Michael J.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2025-01-01","2025","","","","","","9798293808304","ENG","This thesis examined pilot retention challenges in U.S. regional and low-cost carriers (LCCs), focusing on nonfinancial incentives such as quality of life, career stability, and work-life balance, which may have a greater influence on retention than traditional financial incentives. This quantitative, survey-based approach assesses how pilots rank the factors that influence their retention. Using a sample of U.S.-based pilots, the study examines six key areas adapted from a European pilot retention framework. Statistical analyses, including the Friedman test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test, identified correlations between demographic variables and retention priorities.The inherent financial constraints of regional airline business models often mean that offered salaries cannot compete with the compensation packages provided by mainline carriers. However, the findings suggest that nonfinancial quality of life factors, such as desirable pilot bases, work-life balance, and predictable schedules, may counterbalance the financial incentives offered by mainline carriers, especially for the younger generation of pilots entering the workforce. Addressing the methodological limitations identified within the study and conducting comprehensive mixed-methods research in the future, will further clarify pilot retention dynamics, offering practical guidance to airline management, policymakers, and labor organizations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3246414757?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=gPhrwaDOMrtXAbV8LSi5cVbNKB8%3D",""

However, the long-term retention and application of this knowledge in clinical practice remain a significant challenge. This systematic review synthesised global evidence from diverse studies on the short / long-term retention and clinical application of basic sciences among medical doctors.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted across six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, Emcare, and Informit. The review included studies that encompassed a variety of study designs, participant groups, and educational interventions. The Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was utilised to assess the quality of the reviewed studies.ResultsA total of 10 studies were included in the review. The findings revealed that rehearsals significantly optimise the retention of basic science knowledge among medical practitioners. Retention varied by discipline, with medical practitioners retaining more knowledge in anatomy (mean scores ranging from 45.0 to 82.9%), while microbiology had the lowest retention score (39.1%). Factors influencing retention included age, gender, and curriculum type. Educational interventions such as targeted courses, integration of basic sciences with clinical skills, generative retrieval and continuous quality improvement in the curriculum were found to enhance both knowledge retention and clinical reasoning. The concept of ‘encapsulated knowledge’ demonstrates that integrated basic science knowledge helps in synthesising clinical presentations, reducing the need for detailed recall as clinical experience increases. The reviewed studies primarily involved interns and surgeons, leaving a significant gap in research for specialties like internal medicine and primary care/ general practice.ConclusionDetailed retention of basic science knowledge may diminish over time; however, the conceptual framework remains essential for ongoing learning and clinical reasoning. This review’s findings highlight the need for specialised educational interventions to improve long-term retention. Continuous professional development and targeted educational techniques are vital for maintaining clinical competence and applying basic science knowledge effectively throughout a medical career. Further research is needed to address gaps in specialty-specific knowledge application and the impact of different instructional methods.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3115122066?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=qTuzZKVeSXp7XYcLrOpYXdMau1I%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-024-05952-8"
"A Theory of False Cognitive Expectancies in Airline Pilots","","Cortes, Antonio I.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2011-01-01","2011","","","","","","978-1-267-11530-0","ENG","The Theory of False Cognitive Expectancies was developed by studying high reliability flight operations. Airline pilots depend extensively on cognitive expectancies to perceive, understand, and predict actions and events. Out of 1,363 incident reports submitted by airline pilots to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aviation Safety Reporting System over a year's time, 110 reports were found to contain evidence of 127 false cognitive expectancies in pilots. A comprehensive taxonomy was developed with six categories of interest. The dataset of 127 false expectancies was used to initially code tentative taxon values for each category. Intermediate coding through constant comparative analysis completed the taxonomy. The taxonomy was used for the advanced coding of chronological context-dependent visualizations of expectancy factors, known as strands, which depict the major factors in the creation and propagation of each expectancy. Strands were mapped into common networks to detect highly represented expectancy processes. Theoretical integration established 11 sources of false expectancies, the most common expectancy errors, and those conspicuous factors worthy of future study. The most prevalent source of false cognitive expectancies within the dataset was determined to be unconscious individual modeling based on past events. Integrative analyses also revealed relationships between expectancies and flight deck automation, unresolved discrepancies, and levels of situation awareness. Particularly noteworthy were the findings that false expectancies can combine in three possible permutations to diminish situation awareness and examples of how false expectancies can be unwittingly transmitted from one person to another. The theory resulting from this research can enhance the error coding process used during aircraft line oriented safety audits, lays the foundation for developing expectancy management training programs, and will allow researchers to proffer hypotheses for human testing using flight simulators.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/916953379?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=K8UtNfF%2BpiE6EuXbGBzcfhkaowA%3D",""

This research aims to understand the role of affect in aviation training. We examined participants' (N = 19) affect in simulated aviation training while they perform ten aviation tasks designed to their skill level. Performance was graded with a rubric provided by our collaborator, CAE Inc. Affective states were inferred from two biometric measurements (electrodermal activity, facial expression) and one 'ground truth' measurement (experiential self-report). Convergent results were found among all the data channels: Arousal from facial expression and electrodermal activity correlated positively with each other; Correlations between biometrically inferred affect and self-reported affect correlates (workload, fatigue, effort, perceived control and value) were found and were consistent with past research. These convergent findings support the validity of the measurements. Furthermore, we found that arousal (inferred from electrodermal activity) positively predicted performance in low difficulty task, and that mental workload (as measured from self-report) negatively predicted performance in medium and difficult tasks. We found that emotions did not vary significantly by how well a task was performed.This research adds empirical evidence on the impact of affective states on aviation training performance. Furthermore it addresses a gap in the literature regarding mechanisms to demonstrate convergence between multimodal affect data. This research is a preliminary step to a comprehensive assessment of affect in aviation training, which could eventually help training instructors to allocate appropriate scaffolding to pilots where needed, thereby improving the overall training experience and pilot performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2513239433?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=2EoWnd8iIPi4Q7kK2ZqtuFc2RU4%3D",""

Simulation-based training (SBT) is widely used to address this, offering learners opportunities to practise and receive feedback during debriefing. However, existing performance tools often lack the clarity, behavioural specificity, and educational scaffolding required to support deep reflective learning. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the Performance Reflection Model for Resuscitation (PRM-Resus) and to integrate it with the ALS Team Model and structured video exemplars as a comprehensive learning package to enhance ALS training.MethodsThe study involved four phases. Phase 1 created the ALS Team Model to clarify individual roles. Phase 2 focused on co-designing PRM-Resus, using team expertise and the Team Model to create behaviourally anchored performance descriptors. In Phase 3, video scenarios were produced to represent ALS team performance at varying proficiency levels. Phase 4 evaluated the PRM-Resus through expert think-aloud studies. Qualitative content analysis was used alongside Cronbach’s alpha to assess internal consistency and its use for SBT.ResultsThe PRM-Resus comprises four domains—clinical skills, clinical knowledge, team management, and leadership—each defined by behavioural descriptors across three performance levels. The participating experts endorsed the tool’s clarity, structure, and educational value for novice learners. Internal consistency was high (α > 0.95). When used alongside the ALS Team Model and video exemplars, PRM-Resus facilitated deeper performance analysis, which had potential for enhancing post-simulation reflection and supporting faculty development.ConclusionsThis study presents a novel, interdisciplinary framework that integrates PRM-Resus, the ALS Team Model, and video exemplars to support reflective learning in ALS simulation. Together, these tools help novice learners build a concrete understanding of effective team performance and enable educators to deliver more structured feedback. Further research should explore its impact on learner development and potential translation into improved clinical outcomes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3292114547?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=CTrLlZrMgCE41XucR4WoteDC6Iw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-025-07509-9"
"An Investigation into the Relevance of Shared Mental Models in Youth Work Settings, Supporting Young People to Achieve Positive Outcomes","","Shepherd, Karen","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2024-01-01","2024","","","","","","9798346819226","ENG","This research demonstrates the relevance of shared mental models (SMMS) in developing the effectiveness of youth work teams. Much of the literature states that SMMs are crucial for team efficacy in healthcare settings, business, and aviation, although there is limited research about their development. Cooper et al. (2016) explored teamwork and collaboration, critical elements of SMMs, specifically in mental health services, and their importance in achieving positive outcomes for young people. Similarly, Fox (2022) researched a team of experts in social work education, discovering that cohesion and team support, again critical factors of SMMs, are essential for positive outcomes. Therefore, given their widespread use, SMMs have proven valuable tools in numerous sectors. However, utilising and developing SMMs in youth work have not received much attention in the literature.Literature was scanned for constructs relating to supporting young people in youth support environments, primarily from UK websites such as the National Youth Agency (2024), The Centre for Youth Impact (2023), The Prince’s Trust (2024), Youth and Policy (2024) and What Works for Children’s Social Care (2024) were also used.The methodology utilised a quantitative approach, which involved a ranking questionnaire to gauge the alignment of perceptions among team members in a charitable organisation that supports young people. Ten constructs were derived from the literature and used for a questionnaire. The study aimed to determine the extent of shared understanding among small teams in close and supportive environments, ultimately aiding young people in achieving positive outcomes and transitioning to independence. To this end, the presence of an SMM was evaluated.The study revealed a degree of agreement in mental models within the team and significant disparities in priority setting. These disparities present opportunities for enhancing SMMs to boost team effectiveness and facilitate more positive outcomes. These findings underscore the potential of SMMs to address issues arising from restricted resources and the complex support requirements of young people, particularly during the post-COVID recovery period (Jeffs and Smith, 2010; Rhodes and Dubois, 2008) and with the large cohort of young people currently transitioning to independence (OECD, 2024). This potential offers a beacon of hope for improving youth support services.This study offers a new perspective on how to work more effectively with what we already have, given cost-cutting, recruitment and changing governmental priorities, to ensure that young people receive the best available support. It underscores the transformative power of SMMs in bolstering team effectiveness, particularly within youth support services. It asserts that SMMs are critical in enhancing organisational performance, aligning with the literature on the transformative power of integrated team mental models (Jonker et al., 2010). The research advocates for targeted SMM development training as a strategic approach to fortify the functionality of youth support teams. It also calls for further investigation into effective SMM strategies and recommends that organisations invest in training programs that promote comprehensive, mutual understanding among team members. This research has found that SMMs are an important element of effective teams in many support environments other than youth work. Accordingly, the sector should consider its importance in improving the outcomes for young people against a backdrop of everdecreasing support resources.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3143984496?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=qdvgM4p82c7kKLuAi2aoKYgYsnk%3D",""

Recent research resulted in an additional area of interest focused on seeking answers addressing how decisions are made in high-risk aviation environments. This quantitative research studied aviation and non-aviation subjects and analyzed the verbal behavior identified from the choices made on a personality test. The literature supported the perception that verbal statements are the result of an individual's thought processes and the collection of environmental causes that may be used to understand behavior. The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) (Alpine Media Corporation, 2003) provided a numerical score for factors such as thinking versus feeling and judging versus perceiving with replicable operational outcomes. A Multiple Analysis of Variance, with Grade Point Average (GPA) as a covariate was performed. The dependent variable scores on the KTS scales of Feeling, Thinking, Judging, and Perception were analyzed to determine whether any significant differences existed between the Master of Aeronautical Science (MAS) and Master of Science in Technical Management (MSTM) groups. A significant difference on the scale of Thinking and Judging was found for the MSTM group but not for the MAS group.

With it comes ubiquitous benefits such as expansive data processing, enhanced prediction capabilities, and autonomous machinery. The latter of these examples is one of great popularity and controversy, self-driving cars being a prime example of both. With the strides taken in this development, the idea of self-flying aircraft was subsequently derived and pursued. Despite the futuristic excitement behind autonomous airliners, the likelihood of its successful implementation is low. This claim comes from practical research into the plausibility of the technology and is heavily dependent on the idea that human beings find irreplaceable value in knowing that there is human life in manual control of the aircraft. Through different levels of autonomy, there are respectively different levels of acceptance and understanding within society. The history of aviation does contain the implementation and development of autopilot systems and other systems that allow for minimal to no manual control. However, there is an eventual limit to what can plausibly be implemented and developed. Unfortunately for the eager airlines and their investors, the dead end lies in the hands of the passengers and not the technology. Autonomous airliners are at least a few years out, and its implementation will not reach the point of pilotless aircraft.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3132474807?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=UqieckootgNtQaJrnR3pJJvqSgE%3D",""

Also, the effects of age, license type, flight hours, and anxiety as predictors of occupational stress, a possible contributing factor to the high fatality rates, had not been quantified. Personenvironment fit theory formed the theoretical foundation for the study. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors expected from the literature to explain variance in occupational stress in professional pilots. A cross-sectional survey of professional pilots licensed in the United States was conducted (N = 55). Occupational stress was assessed using the Job Stress Survey. Anxiety level was assessed using the Multidimensional Anxiety Questionnaire. Pilot age, license type, and aeronautical experience were also included as predictor variables. Multiple regression analysis revealed that only age had a statistical relationship to occupational stress levels (controlling for all other variables) in commercial and airline transport pilots; older pilots reported less stress. In prior research, higher stress was associated with increased workplace mishaps and health problems. Now that age, more specifically younger pilots, has been associated with higher stress, intervention training can be conducted with pilots. The implications for positive social change include a better understanding of the factors that influence stress among pilots that result in higher levels of job satisfaction and decreased mortality from stress-related factors.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/910335102?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=izFmVXjMsXqS88C02aPYdkfZu0Y%3D",""

The emotive sights, sounds and smells of these dynamic environments are all-encompassing experiences, and responders must also be armed with the emotional preparedness to perform their clinical or managerial duties effectively, as well as the mental resilience to facilitate professional continuance. Despite this, limited training and a sparsity of evidence exists to guide developments within this domain. Historically, major incident training has focused on clinical theory acquisition, but irrespective of how comprehensive the learning materials, they are of little consequence if tandem steps to cultivate mental resilience and emotional preparedness are absent.

Knowing which gaze patterns promote situational awareness can significantly improve nurse instruction.DesignA comparative observational study investigated the role of visual attention on the performance quality, psychophysiological parameters (vital signs, anxiety and stress) and socioemotional competencies (cognitive workload, motivation and self-efficacy) of nursing students with various experience levels.MethodsThirty nursing students divided into two groups according to their academic level: first cycle (n=14) and second-cycle (n=16) faced a clinical simulation scenario to resolve a cardiorespiratory arrest event. Eye tracking-based analysis required the selection of six areas of interest. The monitorization of vital signs included measuring blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation before and after the simulation practice. Participants completed the socioemotional questionnaire (NASA-TLX). They answered the state subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of stress, the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) and the Baessler and Schwarzer General Self-Efficacy Scale.ResultsThe first-cycle group displayed higher vital sign scores than the second cycle, apart from the post-simulation respiratory rate. All physiological parameters increased in mean value after the clinical simulation, except oxygen saturation. Anxiety was the only parameter in the socioemotional domain to present a statistically significant difference between the groups. First-year nursing students showed greater anxiety, stress, mental workload, identified regulation and intrinsic motivation, while second-year students showed higher levels of amotivation, external regulation and perceived self-efficacy.

Drawing on Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory, we test a model using data collected in 2024 from 293 employees at an international airport in Cyprus. Structural equation modeling reveals that resilience significantly enhances both grit and all three HAW dimensions. Among them, affective commitment emerged as a key mediator linking resilience to grit, while job satisfaction showed a surprising negative effect on grit. These findings highlight the importance of fostering eudaimonic rather than purely hedonic well-being to build sustainable motivation in emotionally demanding roles. Our results contribute to the sustainable work and well-being literature by positioning resilience and commitment as psychological resources that support organizational adaptability and long-term employee performance.

"Policy Violations Predicting Fatal General Aviation Accidents from Visual Flight Rules to Instrument Meteorological Conditions","","Jackman, Brett","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2014-01-01","2014","","","","","","978-1-321-38627-1","ENG","Weather is one of the most significant factors affecting general aviation safety.  The associated weather policies that are designed with safety in mind, are some of the most difficult to follow and are the least understood.  This socio–economic problem represents the loss of approximately 100 lives costing insurance companies approximately $600 million dollars yearly in lost aircraft and personnel affecting aviation companies and individuals on the ground.  The problem is that flying into instrument meteorological conditions without a flight plan, proper ratings, currency or medical status, violates established policies and puts safety at risk.  The purpose of this quantitative, ex post facto study was to examine whether policy violations, specifically flight plan, ratings, flight currency, and medical status could predict fatal general aviation accidents flying from visual flight rules to instrument flight rules conditions.  This information assisted in determining if potential training, regulatory modifications, or enforcements are required.  The study evaluated National Transportation Safety Bureau accident investigation data from 1998 to 2013.  The binary logistic regression analysis indicated that Flight Plan violations, Wald statistic = 1.770, df = 1, p = .183, OR = 1.274, 95% CI [.892, 1.819], and Pilot Medical Status violations, Wald statistic = .014, SE = .337, df = 1, p = .905, 95% CI [.496, 1.859] were not statistically significant predictors of Fatality.  The binary logistic regression analysis indicated that Pilot Ratings Violations, Wald statistic = 13.824, SE = .050,  df = 1, p = .000, OR = .832, 95% CI [.755, .917] and Pilot Currency violations, Wald statistic = 15.065, SE = .185,  df = 1, OR = .488, p = .000, 95% CI [.339, .701] were statistically significant predictors of Fatality.  Given that Pilot Rating violations and Pilot Currency violations significantly increase the odds of Fatality, the recommendations included restricting pilots from flying VFR to IMC that are not instrument rated, or who do not have adequate flight time.  Additional recommendations include stronger enforcement of policies, postponing instrument training until the pilot has a minimum of a private pilot certification or requiring that the instrument rating becomes part of a private pilot's certificate.  Recommendations for future research include investigating if multiple violations are likely to occur by the same pilot, and if that further increases the odds of fatality. In addition, future research should investigate if regulation violations are an effective predictor of all fatal accidents regardless of meteorological conditions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1640763908?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=odkA6pC678SieWcWAeYMvbJaTKQ%3D",""

Personality Inventory Revised NEO PI-R is being administered since a long time for IAF pilots’ personality assessment but the normative data supplied by the developer is of United States general population. Extensive researches have already established that fighter pilots’ personality is different from general population and it comprises of emotional stability, superior motivational levels and high mental order capacities. Therefore understanding the personality characteristics of fighter pilots is important while taking aeromedical decision about flying. In India there is no normative data available as regards to NEO PI-R for personality characteristics of fighter pilot population. The objective of current study is to develop normative data of personality characteristics of IAF fighter pilots based on NEO PI-R.Methodology-The NEO PI-R Form-S was administered to (N=169) volunteer male fighter pilots of IAF and their personality assessment was done. The age of pilots was within a range from 21 to 46 years. The experience in terms of flying hours was also varied, with a range of 10-3750 hours. Only fit and in flying medical category pilots were included in the study. 30% pilots were Flying Officers with less flying experience and 20% of the pilots were Wing Commanders with more flying hours experience. The other demographic data included were types of commissioning, involvement in accident/incident and type of entry. The sample was analyzed with SPSS software, raw scores were converted into z score and further transformed into standardized T scores. Normality of data was ascertained by using Shapiro-Wilk test and skewness and kurtosis of the sample distribution. Internal consistency as measured by Cronbach’s alpha for all the five domains ranged from .6-.8 indicating good reliability.Results-Results obtained on NEO PI-R data denotes the pilots’ mean domain scores ranged from 120 (SD ± 17.4) for Conscientiousness to 78.6 (SD ± 14.7) for Neuroticism. The mean facet scores ranged from 12.62 (SD ± 3.9) for angry hostility to 23.4 (SD ±1.4) for warmth. Tables showing percentile equivalents and T scores were drawn. Comparison of the developed normative data with the data supplied with NEO PI-R was done by One Sample t-test and the findings showed statistically significant difference between two. It supports the need for developing specialized norms with large sample size.Discussion:Analysis of the data suggests that there is statistically significant difference between US general population Norms and IAF fighter pilots’ scores. It is inappropriate to compare the personality of IAF fighter pilots’ personality with the developer’s normative data. Referring to the developed norms will be helpful to be precise while assessing pilots, in particular while evaluating their fitness to fly for resuming flying following any conditions that may have affected their motivational level and emotional stability.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2866349731?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=1tcJwiaMYGq9bm3EI47y4f%2BnAg4%3D",""

Noise is also cognitively taxing and if left unmanaged can also adversely affect safety. However, little is known about the effect of a surprise event and a second stressor such as noise on performance. Hence, the aim of the present research was to examine the effect of surprise on decision-making/ cognitive performance and what effect a common stressor such as broadband noise has on this performance. Sixty-three participants completed a Surprised Induced Decision-Making task, half conducted the task in the presence of 75 dBA broadband noise. Reaction time and recall of words presented on an unexpected memory exercise featured as the dependent variables. It was found the surprise event adversely affected reaction time, and this effect was compounded in the presence of broadband noise. Recall performance was poor, irrespective of the two experimental conditions.

People having diverse cultural backgrounds may interpret signage layouts differently with respect to symbols and text. Consequently, dedicated research into signage perception may provide airport administrators with a more informed sense of how to convey appropriate movement and directional information within their terminals. There are many ways to answer the broad question of what signage encourages passengers to move most efficiently through an airport terminal. This study focused on the different ways in which Chinese and American airline passengers navigated through a terminal using either signs showing text only, symbols only, or both text and symbols. Quantitative in nature, the study used a unique computer simulation to generate paths having signage with English text, common symbols, or a combination of both. Participants clicked on arrows to follow the path to the specified goal for each different variation. Total completion time measurements and completion accuracy (in terms of correct versus incorrect clicks) were gathered. Analysis of the results suggested that there was a statistically significant difference related to cultural differences on a passenger's ability to wayfind based on the type of signage used.  Additionally, within cultural groups there was a statistically significant difference as to which arrangements encouraged better wayfinding and those which did not. Lastly, the results suggested a difference in which sign type produced the best wayfinding performance and which sign type people actually preferred.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/747062414?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=IXZu%2BBOuN6szcH1Dt4QxubpTt%2Bw%3D",""

Currently, there is no standardized lighting system to enhance the visibility of sUAS during operations, despite reports of their limited visibility. In response to this issue, my study has identified the characteristics of a system that can enhance the detection and visibility of a sUAS to operators, such as drone pilots and especially Visual Observers (VO). My study has three objectives to achieve this goal: First, conduct a conceptual study to investigate whether specific lighting systems can improve operators' ability to detect and react when searching for a sUAS during operations. Second, I employed a virtual reality (VR) headset system with an eyetracking system to document the participants' responses to the lighting systems. Finally, showcase the effectiveness of Virtual Reality headsets in this kind of research, which could potentially lower logistical expenses and boost the number of participants. My study found that placing LED lights around the perimeter of the sUAS improves detection and reaction times. Additionally, using half-flashing and half-non-flashing lights also improves detection and reaction times. Furthermore, I gathered data from 50 participants using a virtual reality headset, a significant increase in sample size compared to previous studies in the literature. In conclusion, this thesis provides recommendations for future researchers and aims to enhance the safety and effectiveness of sUAS operations through improved visibility systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3098384169?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=zeaAmaZQgehso15Zbde3Zub%2B3rw%3D",""

This narrative review explores the potential impacts of the changing climate on the health and safety of aviation personnel. Furthermore, we examine the significance of resilience in helping these workers adapt and effectively manage climate-related challenges in their professional lives. Climate change poses increasing threats to the well-being of flight personnel through elevated temperatures, heightened ultraviolet radiation exposure, increased mental workload from extreme weather events, and other psychological stressors. Building resilience through workforce training, planning, and adaptation can reduce vulnerability. In future research, the iterative process of selecting measurement components to gauge the impact of climate change should balance feasibility, relevance for stakeholders, and accurately capturing exposure effects. For instance, while salivary cortisol measures stress biologically, assessments of depression or burnout may provide more nuanced insights on pilot health for industry decision-makers managing climate impacts. In conclusion, a strategic emphasis on enhancing the physical and psychological well-being of the aviation workforce is imperative for facilitating a more efficient adaptation within the sector. This is of paramount importance, considering the critical function that aviation serves in fostering human connectivity.

The present review outlines the effect of moderate broadband noise on indices of cognition such as reaction time, attention, short-term and long-term memory, and high(er)-order cognitive tasks such as decision-making, mental arithmetic, grammatic reasoning, or reading comprehension. The present review highlights limitations associated with moderators, and their effect on broadband noise. 43 studies ranging from 1980 to February 2023 were selected and analysed to investigate this issue. Reviewed results offered minimal evidence for a negative effect of moderate broadband noise on cognitive performance. Negative effects that were found, were often evident only under specific circumstances. The roles of cognitive load, repeated session, and individual differences (e.g., sex) were found to differ from theoretical predictions based on evidence from broader noise(s), which highlights the distinctive characteristics of the mild stressor; hence an area for future research.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2921822823?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=AV8dXypmHxsTLNqbeWpgsW1ie7g%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-023-00746-2"

The efficacy of this change on safety, and in particular erroneous behaviours remains unknown and, hence, is the focus of this research. Specifically, this thesis evaluates the impact of these contrasting justice systems on aviation safety using a quantitative approach that includes one observational study and two empirical experiments. The observational study examines how these two justice systems affect aircraft incidents and accidents. The first empirical experiment examines the effect of punishment (i.e., retributive) and feedback (i.e., restorative) on correcting erroneous behaviour, revealing that a restorative justice system may not significantly deter erroneous behaviours compared to a retributive system. The second experiment investigates the effect of removing punishment (i.e., retributive) on performance and error rates under these two justice systems and the influence of personality on this effect. The findings indicate that while restorative justice encourages disclosure and, by extension, fosters a reporting culture, it may not significantly deter erroneous behaviours compared to retributive justice. From an applied perspective, these results highlight that a hybrid justice system, combining elements of both retributive and restorative justice would support incident and error reporting while maintaining a necessary level of deterrence against noncompliance. From a theoretical perspective, such a model would operate under a new framework that posits psychological safety and deterrence not as mutually exclusive but as complementary forces that, when balanced correctly, can optimise performance and error-free behaviour.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3235010793?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=zG8Lx%2B40NmPotYnhxn0SwfW%2B3PA%3D",""

A number of measures to convert the perception of aviation maintenance from a trade to a profession elevating the social status or perceived social status of those active in aviation maintenance have been attempted. Although elevating the social status of the profession is an admirable endeavor, it also may be providing a disservice to the student by painting an unrealistic view of the future and a possible precursor to job dissatisfaction. Disappointment ensues when expectations do not match actuality. The purpose of this analysis is twofold, one purpose is to contrast and compare the social status perceptions of aviation maintenance students to the social status of those currently working in the profession and secondly to analyze the correlation between the social status of the current aviation maintenance workforce and their job satisfaction levels. A sample of two professional aviation maintenance organizations, with memberships comprising regular working members and student members, was made using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire to measure social status, job satisfaction and other contributing factors. This research did not reveal that the social status of the students was inflated stemming from the industry painting an unrealistic image of the profession and therefore supports previous studies that individuals come into the aviation maintenance studies with a preconception of the profession. This also dispels the notion that disappointment follows later when the student enters the professional ranks and the perceived social status level does not materialize leading to job dissatisfaction even though, this study did reveal a very strong correlation between social status and job satisfaction.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/837427623?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=g28ch%2FjnMwdtEsVu3BP8fFuEVFQ%3D",""

Operational errors progress in a chain-like sequence of events. The evolution of an operational error can be studied using a progression system called temporal marker framework and can assist in identifying trends and lead to mitigation policies. Air traffic control error progression has not been previously studied with a large sample. This research used a quantitative correlational analysis of Temporal Marker Time Spans (TMTS), the time difference between the temporal marker categories occurring during an operational error, to determine any significant statistical association between the TMTS by workload as measured by the number of aircraft on the sector at the time of the error. Seventy-three errors were discarded because of audio and visual quality problems and two because they were not procedural errors. The final sample consisted of 334 en-route operational errors. Terminal Radar Approach Control operational errors were not available for download. Errors occurring in the control tower environment were not examined because the Temporal Marker Framework system was designed solely for operational errors in the radar environment. The research questions postulated whether the progression of the operation error, as measured by the TMTS, would be affected by controller workload as measured by the number of aircraft in the sector at the time of the error. None of the TMTS research questions resulted in a statistically significant correlation between any of the TMTS studied and the number of aircraft in the sector at the time of the error. The lack of statistical significance suggests that either other variables are potentially contributory or additional TMTS might need to be studied. Additionally, it was theorized that the progression could be dependent on past events based upon extrapolation from the present. It was further conjectured that the situation as it was unfolding and the reactions of the involved controller could affect the progression of the operational error.

Flight schools and GA industry groups have identified a need to increase student and training retention as important to improving the health of the GA industry. The GA industry has identified women as a group to market to for increasing flight student and licensed pilots. Women aviators have been historically under-represented in military, commercial, and general aviation over the past century. Although women make up about 50% of the general adult population, they represent only 12% of flight students, and only 6% of those with a private pilot certificate. Women's interest in learning to fly remains strong and represents a potential untapped market for the General Aviation industry. Psychology may be able to make a contribution toward understanding why women are under-represented and how they might be attracted and retained in General Aviation training. This study explores how females experience flight training in the initial phase of General Aviation flight training, and whether their experience provides clues to women's under-representation in aviation generally. The study investigates how, over three successive time periods, instructor and female student experience their relationship, both in the task and interpersonal dimensions of training. Findings from this study will elucidate the distinctive ways in which female students make sense of their flight training experience and how GA training can be made more available to women. Results of this study may be relevant for understanding, as well as re-mediating, the presently existing gap between male and female individuals regarding their interest in General Aviation flight training.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/275878382?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=8GkHnlcouWS82g11SFZSdlQyLdE%3D",""

Future aircraft operators in this environment will be tasked with remotely supervising multiple highly automated aircraft on a visual interface while receiving less training than traditional pilots. More research should explore how an operator’s potentially limited understanding of an automated system affects visual performance and interactions between human operators and AAM technologies. This study examined the influence of mental models of an autopilot system on visual attention allocation for participants managing multiple vehicles in a low-fidelity AAM simulation environment. Fifty-five participants completed a series of multi-aircraft control scenarios after reading training slides with or without explicit information on the underlying functionality of an autopilot system (Advanced Mental Model or Basic Mental Model groups, respectively) with their eye movements recorded. The results indicated that the Advanced Mental Model group allocated significantly more visual attention to a supplemental data display than the Basic Mental Model group. Surprisingly, participants allocated more visual attention to the supplemental data display with low than high information bandwidth, which was opposite of the predicted effect. The results also indicated a significant interaction between expectancy and value parameters in the SEEV model, providing additional evidence in support of this theoretical debate. In practice, results from this study show that refining mental models through a simple training program could be an effective approach to alter AAM operators’ visual scan behaviors.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3062310816?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=i8XYw25UH6p1Gtwye8444TtVQyI%3D",""

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach quantitative and qualitative data explored the perceptions of treatment in areas such as policies, bias, representation, mentorship, and career advancement. The research highlights the industry statistic of female pilots, who make up only 6% of the pilot community, and examines systemic challenges, including gender bias, work-life balance issues, and career progression barriers.Through surveys and open-ended, the study revealed that female pilots often perceive greater obstacles related to gender-based stereotypes and informal biases, which impact recruitment, diversity, retention, and operational effectiveness. The findings underscore the complex dynamics of working in a predominantly male profession, where females face additional stressors, including harassment, balancing family life with military demands, and a lack of senior female role models.The results provide actionable insights for addressing gender disparities in USAF aviation, offering recommendations for policy changes, mentorship programs, and recruitment initiatives aimed at improving the retention and treatment of female pilots. By fostering a more inclusive environment, the USAF can enhance both operational readiness and diversity within its pilot corps. This study also contributes to the broader literature on gender diversity in aviation, with implications for commercial and collegiate aviation sectors. Ultimately, it advocates for systemic reforms that ensure equitable opportunities for female pilots, supporting the USAF’s mission to create a more diverse and effective force.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3226832202?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=DrUwow3Hr0wy4dG8icQfCxfpLLk%3D",""
"High-Stakes Testing and Second Chances: From Data to Models","","Sibley, Ciara","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2024-01-01","2024","","","","","","9798383628027","ENG","High-stakes tests are high pressure, high consequence exams that are used to inform decisions of significant impact, such as educational opportunities, job placement, and career advancement. This dissertation advances the understanding of high-stakes aptitude assessments through empirical examination of the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), focusing on its role in selecting candidates for military aviation training. This research utilizes a rich dataset spanning 2013 to 2020, which includes detailed sociodemographic, educational, and aviation-related data used to evaluate the impact of prior experiences, including retesting, on selection test scores and aviation training performance. Findings reveal complexities in distinguishing innate aptitudes from prior educational and test-related experiences, which are also confounded with sociodemographic variables. Furthermore, retesting provides individuals with limited test-relevant experiences additional opportunities to improve selection test scores. However, large practice effects complicate the interpretation of retest scores, which also exhibit differential prediction; over-predicting training performance outcomes for retesters. These findings underscore the challenges with aptitude assessment within high-stakes settings where candidates are highly motivated to seek out test practice and those recently acquired skills are associated with test scores. This can be problematic when prior experiences, like flight instruction, may be financially prohibitive for otherwise capable individuals. Proposed interventions are discussed and include providing official test preparation to minimize disparities due to unequal access, as well as reassessing the role of certain subtests and retest scores in the selection process. This dissertation contributes to the broader discourse on high-stakes testing and has implications for military policy aimed at the pursuit of a highly capable and representative military aviation community. Through comprehensive statistical analyses and computational modeling, this dissertation provides a nuanced understanding of the ASTB's utility and limitations, suggesting pathways for enhancing equity and predictive validity in military aptitude testing.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3090764246?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=jolpvzswaEhtu5EtUjCkZzdE99M%3D",""

Both work and non-work domains are now expected to provide psychological and emotional support. These heightened expectations of the workplace emphasize the increasing need for business organizations to have positive and supportive work environments. To identify how positive organizational culture is created and sustained, a qualitative case study of Duncan Aviation, Inc., the largest privately-held business-aircraft service company in North America was conducted. The study considers mutually interacting situated practices, organizational structure, communication and leadership styles that lie at the core of organization analysis. The study connects with the historical, social and organizational dynamics to identify how to strengthen, change, and influence culture. A systemic, quantum worldview is used as the orienting theoretical framework—recognizing dynamic, self-organizing, interdependent, and interconnected processes—where the role of the observer is crucial. In contrast, Duncan Aviation thrives in an industry that values and relies heavily on a mechanistic, classic worldview of fundamental building blocks and linear cause and effect. The researcher/author, a 19-year employee of the company, interviewed a cross-section of employees. Cultural characteristics, values and attitudes, and the family atmosphere experienced by Duncan Aviation's employees are identified and described. Factors that influence and contribute to this culture include the founder, the company's 44-year history, the aviation industry, the general business world, the employees, training programs, and company leaders. Findings reveal that the characteristics of Duncan Aviation are closely related to those found in strong families, indicating that a company can function as a family for its members. The work culture promotes cohesion, flexibility, and open communication—characteristics found in strong families—and enhance personal well-being. The focus on caring about people makes the boundaries and differences between work organizations and families more diffused and less important than the people involved and their relationships. Five other contemporary companies known for their positive cultures are reviewed. Their similarities with Duncan Aviation support the premise that companies can create environments that serve and function as supportive families.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304613032?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=iHn596puo%2BUoXfsw5D0hwWMHpbg%3D",""

Participants were three Western Michigan University students in the College of Aviation. All participants were licensed pilots with instrument ratings. The main dependent variable was the number of checklist errors or omissions committed by the pilots in simulated flight. During each flight, each participant could make up to 42 errors. The error count would initiate at the appropriate time to perform the “before-take off checklist” and would end one minute after parking the plane, the logical time to complete an “after landing checklist.” A multiple baseline design was implemented in this research with the treatment being implemented at a different point in time for each participant. Either stability in performance or a decrement in performance determined the introduction of the audible checklist. Once stability or a descending trend in paper checklist use had been established, each participant was placed in the intervention phase. During baseline phase the three participants averaged 22.7% compliance per flight. After the simulated audible intelligent checklist intervention was introduced compliance increased to 97%. During the reversal phase compliance decreased to an average of 34%. Visual inspection of the data suggests that an intelligent audible checklist used during actual flights may decrease in-flight errors and possibly decrease aviation incidents and accidents.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1314562566?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2Bgg9KfY4qnrNp85z9WWUS3KLyhw%3D",""

This challenge may arise because gaze metrics such as fixation duration, pupil size, and saccade amplitude are often aggregated across timelines that include heterogeneous events. To address this, we tested whether aggregating gaze parameters across participant-defined events could support the hypothesis that increased focal processing, indicated by greater gaze duration and pupil diameter, and decreased scene exploration, indicated by smaller saccade amplitude, would predict effective task performance. Using head-mounted eye trackers, nursing students engaged in simulation learning and later segmented their simulation footage into meaningful events, categorizing their behaviors, task outcomes, and cognitive states at the event level. Increased fixation duration and pupil diameter predicted higher student-rated teamwork quality, while increased pupil diameter predicted judgments of effective communication. Additionally, increased saccade amplitude positively predicted students’ perceived self-efficacy. These relationships did not vary across event types, and gaze parameters did not differ significantly between the beginning, middle, and end of events. However, there was a significant increase in fixation duration during the first five seconds of an event compared to the last five seconds of the previous event, suggesting an initial encoding phase at an event boundary. In conclusion, event-level gaze parameters serve as valid indicators of focal processing and scene exploration in natural learning environments, generalizing across event types.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3226013828?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=S5ze0aHpXKlAMPoWBzd1L9tNyuw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-025-00640-7"

Literature conceptually supports the need for highly reliable health care facilities but does not show a comprehensive approach to operationalizing the concept into the daily workforce to support patients. The Veterans Health Administration closes the gap by documenting a case study that not only demonstrates specific actions and functions that create a high-reliability organization (HRO) for safety and improvement but also created a learning organization by spreading the knowledge to other facilities.Design/methodology/approachThe authors instituted a methodology consisting of assessments, training and educational simulations to measure, establish and operationalize activities that identified and prevented harmful events. Visual communication boards were created to facilitate team huddles and discuss improvement ideas. Improvements were then measured and analyzed for purposeful outcomes and return on investment (ROI).FindingsHRO can be operationalized successfully in health care systems. Measurable outcomes verified that psychological safety was achieved through the identification and participation of 3,184 process improvement projects over a five-year period, which yielded a US$2.8m ROI. Documented processes and activities were used for educational teachings, which were disseminated to other Veteran Affairs Medical Center’s through the Truman HRO Academy.Practical implicationsThis case study is limited to one hospital in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) network. As the VHA continues to deploy the methods outlined to other hospitals, the authors will perform incremental data collection and ongoing analysis for further validation of the HRO methods and operations. Hospitalists can adapt the methods in the case study for practical application in a health care setting outside of VHA.

This dissertation approached the human factor from the perspective of personal identity and how a transference of identity, or a nonpilot identity, becomes salient and affects pilot decisions.Critical incident technique was used to analyze 193 incidents in the Aviation Safety Reporting System database from January 2008 to December 2009 documenting weather and maneuvering incidents when a ""near-miss"" occurred. Of these 193 incidents, 11 were found to contain a direct reference to salient identity and six were interpreted to have a more indirect, contextual relationship to salient identity. Those in the direct category related to identities as a professional (two cases), business person (two cases), family role (four cases), social or friendship-related role (two cases), and hobbiest (one case). In all 11 cases, the GA pilots were advised of the adverse circumstances in the initial flight planning and ignored them, choosing instead to pursue the flight and acting counter to the role of a safe pilot. Emotions were also evident in the narratives, as when a pilot made an unnecessary emergency landing because of anxiety about his family, and the salient identity was interpreted as affecting cognition and judgment.This study had five findings. (1) Pilots in the incidents discussed in this study showed a salient identity other than pilot, which directly influenced their sensemaking. (2) GA pilots' emotions during critical incidents had a direct effect on their judgment. (3) The pilots' nonpilot identity led to overconfidence, most evident in this study through numerous incidents of ""get-there-itis."" Get-there-itis, as well as other poor pilot decisions, could have been avoided through better preflight planning. (4) Other poor judgments linked to nonpilot salient identities were related to lack of situational awareness and overreliance on technology.

The United States Air Force (USAF) defines a mishap as any unintended Air or Space Force occurrence that results in death, injury, illness, or property damage (Air Force Safety Center, 2024). Class A and B mishaps are defined as the most severe based on the extent and monetary cost of damage and/or injury. On average, mishap trends for this branch of service suggest major improvements in flight safety over time (Light, et al., 2020). However, severe mishaps continue to occur even with improved safety and increased prevention efforts. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used as the primary method to identify––within the Class A and B aircraft mishaps––subgroups with similar patterns of mental health characteristics. The study used a secondary dataset that was extracted from the Department of Defense (DoD, 2005) Human Factors Analysis and Classification System 7.0. The data was extracted from the years 2012 to 2022. A total of 540 mishap cases were analyzed using information from 5 different aircrafts models. LCA revealed a three-class solution for three previously unidentified latent classes. The larger group was determined by mental awareness factors only, the second largest group was determined by state of mind, teamwork, and mental awareness factors. Lastly, a third group was strongly defined by sensory misconception, environmental problems, and mental awareness factors. Results of logistic regression revealed that the group of individuals (Class 2) defined by a combination of cognitive and psychological factors had a higher probability of making judgment and decision-making errors, as well as performance-based errors, compared to the other two groups. The results of this project may support aviation safety and help identify common person-level characteristics and trends associated with these categories of mishaps.

The incorporation of an SMS is new in the United States for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities that operate under the Code of Federal Regulations Part 145. AMTs constitute the bulk of the workers in an MRO. By default, a safety culture and safety consciousness existed in MROs prior to an SMS, and this study was conducted to understand the perceptions of the AMTs in the MROs with an SMS and whether the SMS had an impact on safety culture and safety consciousness after implementation. General system theory grounded the theoretical framework in an effort to explain how all system elements interact with one another. Interviewed AMTs were questioned on perceptions of safety consciousness and safety culture since the implementation of the SMS in their MRO. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 12 AMTs. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data to produce an account of the phenomenon. Six themes were identified through this analysis: (a) positive aspects of SMS adoption and implementation, (b) strategies and considerations on SMS adoption and implementation, (c) improvements in reporting and safety measures, (d) increased participation and involvement, (e) positive changes in safety culture, and (f) increased accountability and oversight. The implications for positive social change include the potential for MRO leaders to implement SMS programs to improve facility safety for the public’s safety via change awareness in safety culture and the safety consciousness of AMTs in an MRO.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3163697322?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=p22jhaqmXaeak8ca1Jpr%2FPfVFsA%3D",""

The current system relies on hand coding of reports to recognize current trends and alert the proper parties. Although the filing party may enter some codified data describing the surrounding scenario (e.g., time of day, weather), there is no opportunity to specify a category if the problem is human error. Considering the prevalence of human error within these incidents (around 55% based on a report by Boeing, 2006), a greater understanding of the driving factors is needed.The current study was an investigation of the human error components of airline incident reports. Text analysis tools were applied to ASRS incident narrative reports to determine a classification based on human performance for commercial and general aviation. The results from the current study demonstrate that an empirically based approach can be used to uncover latent categories within the ""Flight Crew Human Performance"" classified reports. The combined approach of latent semantic analysis, kmeans clustering, and keyword analysis were used successfully in developing a nine element classification of commercial aviation reports and twelve element classification of general aviation reports. The taxonomies suggested by the current study for both commercial and general aviation reveal categories beyond just human error elements. The classification scheme suggested for the commercial aviation reports most closely resembled the ACCERS taxonomy developed by Krokos and Baker (2005; see also Baker & Krokos, 2007), which was constructed to help in categorizing all incident reports. The classification suggested for general aviation reports did not closely resemble any existing classification scheme. Although the suggested taxonomy shared categories such as situational awareness and communication with classifications such as crew resource management (CRM) or single pilot resource management (SRM), the current classification also holds non-human elements such as weather and context.The taxonomies for both commercial and general aviation revealed a category for context, and the difficulty of flying into certain airports was apparent. These findings can be implemented to improve training programs by assisting in the creation of contextually based training scenarios. Furthermore, based on findings for general aviation in particular, pilots could benefit from increased training in situational awareness and monitoring of notices and airspace.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304952929?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Wz3BACk8tjsZWCd25F8KNWNsvlg%3D",""
"Emotional Turbulence During Simulation Training : Unraveling Emotion Dynamics and Performance Accuracy Using Simulations for Pilot Training","","Ruiz-Segura, Alejandra","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2024-01-01","2024","","","","","","9798342120326","ENG","Affective responses, such as stress and emotions, are discussed as factors influencing human error in aviation; however, aviation research tends to explore affect as a subordinate element of cognition. Yet, more and more research is demonstrating that affective responses have a considerable effect on performance accuracy. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation is to examine the impact of pilots’ affective responses on their flying performance accuracy in the context of training using simulations. The investigation started by synthesizing findings of previous research exploring affect and performance when using flight simulations, in a systematic literature review. Based on the findings of the literature review and previous research in education and psychology, two empirical studies were conducted aiming to understand the influence of emotions dynamics in flying performance. Emotions dynamics refer to the patterns and regularities characterizing fluctuations in emotions over time. Thus, the first study examines changes in performance and emotions dynamics (i.e., frequency, intensity, and variability of emotional responses) across training phases and difficulty levels in a flight simulation. The second empirical study builds on the previous one by examining the relationship between emotional variability and flying performance moderated by pilot trainees’ perceived control and value over the task. The findings of this dissertation provide strong evidence that trainees’ performance accuracy when performing simulated flying tasks is connected to their emotional responses. Particularly, findings from the empirical studies suggest that emotion dynamics might have adaptive functions for improving flying accuracy. Results demonstrate that affect and performance are dynamically impacted by training phases, difficulty levels, and subjective perceptions over the task. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions, limitations, and future directions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3122642778?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=RH1rE%2F7HLdQC3XAhYXOnzt2AfmY%3D",""
"Neurocognitive Remediation Therapy: A Promising Approach to Enhance Cognition in Community Living Pilots with Depression and Anxiety","","Nuralieva, N; Chang, M; Huang, L; TS S","Psychology Research and Behavior Management","Scholarly Journals","","17","","2024-01-01","2024","2919","","2919-2939","1179-1578","","","ENG","Depression and anxiety are pervasive mental health issues, affecting millions globally and often accompanied by cognitive impairments with significant repercussions in daily life and professions, particularly in safety-critical roles like community-living pilots. This exploration assesses Neurocognitive Remediation Therapy (NRT) as an innovative solution for addressing cognitive deficits linked to depression and anxiety in these pilots. Theoretical underpinnings of NRT draw from cognitive rehabilitation, neuropsychology, and neuroplasticity principles. Depression and anxiety often manifest as cognitive deficits, impacting attention, memory, executive functions, and decision-making. NRT interventions aim to address these impairments by enhancing cognitive flexibility, attentional control, and memory through training exercises and cognitive restructuring, empowering individuals to regain cognitive functionality and adaptability. Empirical evidence supports NRT’s efficacy in enhancing cognitive functioning, showing significant improvements in attention, memory, and executive functions. This review focuses on NRT’s potential to improve cognition in community pilots, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing cognitive deficits and enhancing job performance, even in high-pressure environments like aviation. The practical implications of NRT for pilots are profound. Tailored programs can address specific cognitive challenges, such as maintaining vigilance and decision-making under stress. Integrating NRT into training regimens enhances skill sets and mental resilience, contributing to safety and success. Additionally, NRT positively impacts emotional well-being, reducing stress and improving overall quality of life. In Conclusion, NRT emerges as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive functioning in community-living pilots with depression and anxiety. Evidence suggests its potential to improve performance, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Further research and implementation are crucial to fully realize its benefits and ensure pilots’ safety and success.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3265955117?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=PQa4QYSRKyJPo6a7T5wfs9lYDhY%3D","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S446634"

Pilots regularly work for extensive periods in inhospitable and high-pressure operational conditions, exposing them to considerable work-related stress. This has raised calls for a more systemic cultural change across the aviation industry, championing a more holistic perspective of pilot health and well-being. The study aims to explore how peer coaching (PC) can promote an inclusive psychosocial safety climate enhancing pilot well-being and can mitigate hazardous attitudes and dysfunctional behaviours.Design/methodology/approachAdopting an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were conducted with military and civilian peer coach/coachee pilots and key industry stakeholders, totalling 39 participants. The research provided significant insights into the perceived value of PC in promoting both pilot health and mental well-being (MW) and flight safety across the aviation industry.FindingsThe study highlights four key PC superordinate themes, namely, coaching skills, significance of well-being, building of peer relationships and importance of confidentiality and autonomy. Such combined themes build reciprocal trust within peer conversations that can inspire engagement and effectively promote personal well-being. The contagious effect of such local interventions can help stimulate systemic cultural change and promote a positive psychosocial safety climate throughout an organisation and, in this case, across the aviation industry. This study provides a PC conceptual framework “Mutuality Equality Goals Autonomy Non-evaluative feedback, Skill Confidentiality Voluntary Supervisory (MEGANS CVS),” highlighting the salient features of PC in promoting MW.Research limitations/implicationsThe study highlights the salient features of PC and its role in promoting peer conversations that enable personal transition, openness and acceptance. This study also highlights how PC and well-being can be used to encourage inclusivity and engagement, thereby strengthening institutional resilience.Practical implicationsThis study highlights how PC that can assist HRM/HRD professionals to embed a more inclusive and salutogenic approach to MW that can reshape organisational cultures. This study highlights the significance and link of workplace stress to hazardous attitudes and dysfunctional behaviours. It further notes that whilst the MEGANS CVS peer coaching framework has been applied to pilots, it can also be applied across all sectors and levels.Social implicationsThis study highlights the value of PC as an inexpensive means to engage at the grassroots level, which not only improves personal performance, safety and well-being but by building peer relationships can also act as a catalyst for positive and deep organisational cultural change.Originality/valueThis study offers the MEGANS CVS framework that exposes insights into PC practice that can assist HRM/HRD professionals embed a more inclusive and salutogenic approach to health and well-being that can reshape organisational cultures. This study highlights the significance and link of workplace stress to hazardous attitudes and dysfunctional behaviours, and whilst this framework has been applied to pilots, it can also have relevance across all sectors and levels.

In this study, I investigate both observed ride demand and periods of client inactivity among ABC Transfer’s customers, meaning individuals who may not book rides in a given period but are not necessarily disengaged. ABC Transfer is a luxury ground transportation firm headquartered in upstate South Carolina. Using an unbalanced panel dataset spanning 2012 to 2024, I estimate a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model to distinguish between individuals who might still be clients from those who are not likely to be clients any longer. The model accounts for price sensitivity across client types (personal, corporate, aviation) through interaction terms and incorporates time-fixed effects to control for changes in market conditions.Results show that price is significantly negatively associated with ride volume, with a one-dollar increase in price predicting a 0.55% decrease in expected ride count for the baseline aviation client. While corporate and personal accounts exhibit similar sensitivity to price, their interaction terms are not statistically significant in the count model, indicating that the effect of price on ride demand does not differ meaningfully between account types after controlling for other variables. Corporate clients take significantly fewer transfer rides overall, with an estimated 72% lower ride activity relative to aviation clients.In the inflation portion of the ZIP model, which estimates the likelihood that an individual who does not book a ride is no longer an active client, higher prices significantly reduce the probability of disengagement. These results suggest that while price increases may suppress ride frequency, they do not necessarily lead clients to abandon the service. Price sensitivity varies by client type in this regard: both personal and corporate clients are significantly less likely than aviation clients to disengage in response to price increases, indicating a stronger likelihood of remaining engaged with the platform.Simulations using the Poisson component of the initial model predict that a $100 price reduction would yield the largest increases in ride volume among aviation clients, with more modest effects for corporate and personal clients. Strong temporal effects in both model components reflect market growth over time and cohort effects among clients in early periods. These findings suggest that while price influences ride frequency, it plays a more complex role in long-term client engagement. For luxury transportation providers, differentiated pricing strategies by client type may help maintain participation even as prices fluctuate, highlighting the importance of loyalty among high-value clients and the strategic potential of targeted retention efforts.A second specification of the zero-inflated Poisson model was estimated to address the possibility that the average price an individual would face while potentially being a client is correlated with unobserved individual characteristics that also influence ride demand. This average price, calculated as the mean of the prices a client did pay or would have paid across observed periods, is included as a Mundlak control.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3266811864?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=TZsopCLARc%2FMYCqHEXH7dNgWe90%3D",""

In this study, we explored the factor structure of two commonly used measures of HP and OP in a sample of 701 Australian parents of adolescents (aged 16 – 19 years) and compared the correlations of the emergent factors with measures of parenting behaviors, mental health, and parenting pressures. Two factors were found that differentiated 13 items that referred to generally controlling and demanding OP behaviors (Demanding OP) from 8 items that referred to parenting under conditions of child difficulty suggesting a response to the child needs (Responsive OP). Before adjustment (i.e., zero-order correlations), but especially after adjusting for scores on the other factor (i.e., partial correlations), Demanding OP was associated with less positive (e.g., autonomy support) and more negative (e.g., control) parenting behaviors, as well as higher scores on parent anxiety, child anxiety and antisocial behavior, parental burnout, social comparison to parents on social media, and job/financial pressures. After adjustment for Demanding OP, Responsive OP aligned with positive parenting and more enjoyment of parenting, but was not associated with burnout or parent anxiety, and had little association with child mental health.

Results indicate that NOx and CO2 emissions showed the highest correlation with air traffic volume and fuel consumption (R = 0.63 and 0.67, respectively). Bayesian Linear Regression and Linear Regression emerged as the most accurate models, achieving an R2 value of 0.96 and 0.97, respectively, for predicting PM2.5 concentrations. Meteorological factors had a moderate influence, with precipitation negatively correlated with PM2.5 (−0.03), while temperature and wind speed showed limited effects on emissions. A significant decline in aviation emissions was observed in 2020, with CO2 emissions decreasing by 28.1%, NOx by 26.5%, and PM2.5 by 35.4% compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The dependent variable was risk perception. Predictors were partitioned into three sets, A = Demographics, B = Flight Experience, and C = Affective Domain, and the sample consisted of 93 GA pilots. Participants were solicited from member institutions of the University Aviation Association. A hierarchical regression analysis with set entry order A-B-C found no significant factors at the first two stages, including corresponding increments. When the Affective Domain entered the analysis, age, number of hazardous events, and locus of control had a significant relationship with risk perception. Age had a direct relationship, hazardous events had an indirect relationship, and locus of control had a positive relationship. The increment of the Affective Domain also was significant, and an independent follow-up analysis revealed psychological distress had a significant and direct relationship with risk perception. An independent mediation analysis also found the number of hazardous events was partially mediated by psychological distress, and this mediation reduced the effect of hazardous events on risk perception. The findings of the study did not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute Bandura’s (1977) self-efficacy theory, partially supported Ajzen’s (1992) theory of planned behavior with respect to locus of control, and supported habituated action theory.

However, existing approaches to CL face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, which occurs when a model’s performance on previously learned tasks declines after learning the new task. In this dissertation, we focus on the crucial role of input data features in determining the robustness of CL models to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We propose a framework to create CL-robustified versions of standard datasets using a pre-trained Oracle CL model. Our experiments show that the CL model trained on CL-robust features mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then introduce a novel approach inspired by neuroscience called robust rehearsal, which distills CL-robust samples without needing a pre-trained Oracle model or pre-distilled CL-robust sample for training the CL model. We demonstrate that rehearsal-based CL approaches mitigate catastrophic forgetting using CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provided real-world helicopter attitude datasets. Moreover, we propose an approach to address the observed issue of overfitting rehearsal memory through adversarial diversification. This approach increases the complexity of rehearsal samples, reduces memory overfitting, and maintains their effectiveness throughout sequential learning. Finally, we conducted an extensive study to further elucidate the crucial role of features in shaping the model’s overall characteristics, specifically its robustness and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3049905800?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=gV%2FHe1iYIxek%2FTWi%2BTxKRQafiUg%3D",""

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative airport noise perception and monitoring approach leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This method integrates multiple data streams, encompassing noise, meteorological, and ADS–B data, to achieve precise noise event tracing and deep multi-source data fusion. Furthermore, this study employs Kriging interpolation and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) techniques to perform spatial interpolation on data from sparse monitoring sites, thereby constructing a spatial distribution model of airport noise. The results of the practical application demonstrate that the proposed airport noise monitoring method can accurately reflect the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of airport noise and effectively correlate noise events, thereby providing robust data support for the development of airport noise control policies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3194640556?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Q7qIUTC9H6h9sClAct7OHwxK4N8%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/s25082347"

Given the heterogeneous findings in previous research, further investigation into the impact of environmental noise on brain health and cognitive function is crucial. This study explores the relationship between both objective and subjective residential noise exposure and cognitive functioning, as well as markers of brain damage, in a large adult population. The analysis also considers dementia risk factors and demographic variables for a comprehensive understanding.MethodCross‐sectional data on cognitive functioning and brain volumes (MRI markers) from 4,018 Dutch participants aged 40‐75 from The Maastricht Study were matched with address‐level noise exposure data (noise: from roads, railways, aviation, industry, and wind turbines) from the Geoscience and Health Cohort Consortium. Subjective noise exposure (traffic, work, and neighbor noise) was assessed via self‐report questionnaires. Linear and non‐linear relationships were explored using multiple regression analyses and restricted cubic splines, adjusted for air pollution, demographic and dementia risk factors. Pathways via hearing loss, daytime sleepiness, and depression were also assessed through interaction analyses.ResultHigher residential noise exposure was linked to lower white matter (WM) volume and higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume. An U‐shaped relationship was observed between residential noise and grey matter (GM) volume. Objective noise exposure was not associated with cognitive function. Subjective noise exposure at work was associated with worse overall cognition, memory, and executive functioning and attention. Interaction analyses for hearing loss, daytime sleepiness, and depression did not alter the results. Sensitivity analyses revealed a significant positive interaction between objective noise and age for CSF volumes.ConclusionOur findings indicate that higher residential noise exposure is associated with brain atrophy (lower WM and higher CSF volumes), while the relationship with GM was unexpected. Additionally, subjective noise exposure at work was linked to worse cognitive performance, suggesting a discrepancy between objective and subjective noise effects. Lastly, older individuals might be more vulnerable to the effects of noise exposure. Future research should explore factors such as housing quality, noise mitigation, and the potential threshold effects of noise exposure on brain health.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3285988546?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3D%2B60IozaA0uX42pssFuBuDkenQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz70860_104278"

A total of 30,630 individuals were eligible for the analysis. Multilevel model framework was applied to account for the clustered structure of the regional-level data in which individual-level data containing demographic characteristics and health information were nested. As a result of the analysis, Individuals living in the highest environmental noise area had a 1.55 times higher likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms than those living in the lowest environmental noise area (95% CI, 1.04–2.31). After stratified analysis according to depressive symptom severity, individuals residing in areas with the highest environmental noise exposure had significantly higher odds of mild (aOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.02–2.07) and moderate symptoms (aOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.00–2.91).

The aim of this study was to measure the association between health behaviors and mental health.MethodsA cross‐sectional study was conducted among 502 airline pilots. The primary outcome measure was the mental component score (MCS), derived from the Short Form Health Survey 12v2. We collected information regarding age, sex, ethnicity, height, body mass, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking status, moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable intake, and sleep duration.ResultsAfter controlling for demographic and anthropometric parameters, MVPA, fruit and vegetable intake, and sleep duration were positively correlated with MCS (p ≤ 0.001), and alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking were negatively correlated with MCS (p ≤ 0.001).

Thus, a survey has been conducted to understand how peoples’ behavior inhibition and activation systems relates to their willingness to fly during the pandemic period, and what kind of promotions could increase their willingness to fly. For this aim, from March 2021 to May 2021, 1231 people were reached over the internet using the convenience-sampling method, and 862 respondents answered the questionnaire. Structural Equation Model was used to test the proposed model and t- test, correlation analysis and descriptives were used in the analysis of the obtained data. Main findings of the research showed that willingness to fly is mostly affected by health measure promotions instead of price promotions. In addition, it was found that willingness to fly during the pandemic period changed based on gender. The results of the structural equational modelling showed that a higher level of BIS is related to higher levels of perceived travel risk, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity; and perceived travel risk was found to mediate the relationship between BIS and willingness to fly during the pandemic.

It will discuss how the unique characteristics of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) are critical to understanding their specific impact on those they overfly and their characterisation as ‘flying watchtowers’. The introduction of Predator and Reaper aircraft into the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) inventory will be used as a case study to explore this contention and to argue that the RAF and the Ministry of Defence should communicate more thoroughly and proactively about new technologies than they have done in the recent past. The paper will then consider what implications this might have for the introduction of future technologies. In doing so, it will highlight the importance of capturing lessons from the RAF’s recent experience of ‘wars of choice’ and counter-insurgency, however diverting the current global security challenges may be. In the context of the proposed new human right to protect the freedom to live without physical or psychological threat from above, recent research has demonstrated that the particular characteristics of RPAS may impact the mental health of those they surveil.

Noise load was measured during flights with two aircraft (Zlín Z43 and Diamond DA-40 TDI), resulting in the acquisition of 4,361,300 data points. This dataset was collected during two data acquisition sessions for each aircraft, encompassing three phases of flight: takeoff, in-flight, and landing. During the flight, noise measurements were conducted based on five indicators: sound pressure, fluctuation strength, roughness, sharpness, and tonality. Based on the measured data, the platform was verified and configured, and example evaluations were demonstrated. This study employed modern methods of intelligent data analysis, utilizing both univariate and multivariate membership functions. The developed platform incorporates quantitative dynamic data obtained from devices measuring psychophysiological load, integrating professional mental health assessments and predicting dynamic work environment indicators for modeling load trends. Early detection of critical load levels helps protect the health of flight instructors, thus creating a safe working environment for training new pilots.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3217722674?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=50H4sy8ENLI%2BgmmnmfWJuMjL%2BVc%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app15115917"

The health emergency period has exacerbated these challenges to health and well-being, with long COVID adding further strain to aviation professionals even in the post-pandemic scenario. In this context, it is essential to promote positive organizational behaviors to reconcile individual well-being with work performance. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms linking burnout to work performance behaviors (i.e., proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity) among pilots, hypothesizing the mediating role of continuous learning behaviors. Based on the Conservation of Resources theory, we posited that burnout depletes pilots’ resources, thereby hindering continuous learning and reducing performance behaviors. Moreover, this study examined the work-related stress factors that could affect burnout and the consequences of performance behaviors on actual performance measured by a flight simulator. Data were collected from 123 pilots through an online survey and analyzed using path analysis. The results revealed that continuous learning mediated the relationship between burnout and work performance behaviors. Furthermore, work-related stress factors were significantly related to burnout, and work performance behaviors were linked to flight simulator performance. Our findings underscored the critical role of continuous learning in explaining the adverse effects of burnout on performance. These insights could inform targeted interventions to promote continuous learning and stress management among aviation professionals, ensuring sustained performance and well-being in the long term.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3120707037?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=om8xot%2FnmJEzAXOwlTKWTgv7KK4%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci13100513"

Employing a questionnaire survey, the study collected 282 valid samples and conducted an empirical analysis using structural equation modelling. The evaluation comprehensively examined PS across four dimensions: software (parking management systems), hardware (parking facilities and surveillance equipment), environment (physical surroundings and layout design), and liveware (drivers and managerial staff). The findings reveal that PS does not exert a significant direct effect on RWB but influences it indirectly by enhancing RS. Additionally, environmental factors directly improve RWB but have no significant impact on PS. RS, in turn, has a marked positive effect on RWB.

New aviation noise policies are needed for the 21st century, respecting the lived experience of affected communities. Existing surveys have reported adverse impacts from aviation noise but more information is needed to understand the factors that contribute to those impacts.ObjectiveTo evaluate the impacts of current aircraft noise exposure on impacted communities and their determinants.MethodsA 10-question online community pilot survey was distributed in May 2022 to an email list of groups and individuals in aviation-impacted communities. The survey was open for two weeks. Information on geographic location, frequency of exposure, and type of aircraft exposure were collected. Seven questions focused on the type and magnitude of health impacts, perceptions, and concerns.ResultsA total of 1452 surveys were completed within the 2-week period. Respondents report experiencing loud, repetitive, low-altitude aircraft noise - day and night - causing stress and negative effects on mental and physical health. For many, “annoyance” did not adequately describe their experience. Strong, consistent exposure-response patterns for weekly flight frequency (<100 to >1000 flights) were found for most health impacts, perceptions, and concerns. The likelihood of adverse impacts and heightened perceptions and concerns was greatest in respondents exposed mainly to military aircraft.SignificanceCurrent aviation noise policy is based on annoyance, and relies on a metric that exceeds safe levels and does not meaningfully convey community impact. Aviation-impacted communities are experiencing mental and physical health impacts that extend beyond annoyance. The magnitude of impact is influenced by flight frequency and aircraft type. Aviation noise policy should be updated to account for those factors and focus on reducing public health impacts and their human and economic costs.Impact StatementAviation noise policy in the United States is decades old and is based solely on the concept of annoyance without sufficient regard to the harms caused to health and well-being of people living in aviation-impacted communities. Efforts to amend the policy must be informed by the scientific evidence on the adverse effects of noise and health and by metrics that properly represent the lived experiences of communities. The results of this pilot survey highlight the importance of incorporating these aspects into policy for preventing and mitigating harms caused by aviation noise, especially as the industry grows.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3173172530?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=PDPoNYbtwkkd9jNWfuBO9kGkWDQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-024-00737-z"

Then, by combining the results of a questionnaire survey on A320, A330, B737, and B777 transition training and training cost data, it was verified quantitatively that inter-aircraft similarity has a positive impact on reducing the difficulty and cost of transition training. Taking the similarity in aircraft types as a feature, the KNN algorithm was used to successfully construct a difficulty prediction model for the training program of aircraft-type transition training. To overcome the limitation of insufficient training cost data volume, this study adopts the transfer learning method to construct a prediction model of the transition training cost, and the final significant prediction accuracy proves the effectiveness of the method. The research in this paper not only provides strong data support for the resource planning and cost management of airlines’ aircraft-type transition training but also provides new research perspectives and methodological guidance for the field of aviation training.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2930469861?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=N9tIZuyQmaviQjwextdDbNNOHTk%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace11020166"

Among these, helicopter parenting remains particularly controversial: while some consider it a protective approach, others believe that excessive control can hinder the development of a child’s autonomy and independence. Our research is significant because it approaches the topic from a rarely examined pedagogical perspective, thereby contributing to the psychology-dominated literature. We conducted our analysis using the EBSCO Discovery Service search engine and followed the steps of the PRISMA protocol. The aim of the study is to explore the relationship between helicopter parenting and academic achievement, as well as to review the factors—such as career-related decisions and adaptation—that may play a mediating role in this relationship. It reviews 33 studies published between 2012 and 2024, most of which use quantitative methods. Most of these studies were conducted in the United States and focus primarily on the college-age demographic. Our findings show that recognising and addressing helicopter parenting behaviours is essential to supporting student success. Furthermore, educational institutions should more actively make use of the potential resources and opportunities offered by such parenting behaviours. Overall, our findings confirm that helicopter parenting remains an under-researched topic at both the national and European levels, particularly in the context of education and public education systems, where further research is clearly needed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3265946981?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=8v%2F3LbeuDn8L8l9oyQZgnB4sT54%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci14100621"

The flying public desires a safe flying environment expecting to fly everywhere in all types of weather and flight conditions. The complex nature of the aircraft and their operating environment provide opportunities for automation failures to affect flight operations. Previous research has examined the nature of automation failures to understand the relationships between variables such as the phase of flight, experience, flight conditions, and training. Qualitatively, scientists have investigated the nature of the human-machine interaction to determine how individuals make sense of automation failures, yet none have examined the experience from the pilot’s perspective. Giorgi’s descriptive phenomenological psychological method focuses on the individual subjective descriptions and synthesizes a psychological profile of the automation failure experience. The results describe a pilot's lived-experiential loop, which includes an awareness of themselves, their aircraft, and automation failure. Their present-moment stream of consciousness demonstrates a continual situational awareness augmented by their past training and operational experiences and reinforced by their future objectives. The research gives pilots and researchers a glimpse into the thoughts of aviators that experience automation failures and describe the psychological constituents of those experiences. The structure of the automation failure experience provides an empathetic understanding of the pilot sensemaking processes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2471484216?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=qj4eo%2Fzw%2BDhlY0%2B62vwyWs4iy5Y%3D",""

This study examined relationships between psychological wellbeing, organizational support, and job satisfaction among 38 South African aviation professionals during the post-pandemic recovery period. Quantitative survey data was analysed using correlational and multiple regression techniques. Results revealed positive associations between organizational support, psychological wellbeing, and job satisfaction. In the multiple regression model, organizational support emerged as the strongest predictor, explaining over a quarter of variance in job satisfaction (β = .52, p < .001). This highlights its crucial buffering capacity amid acute pressures. Psychological wellbeing also exhibited a robust positive relationship with job satisfaction (β = .43, p < .01), emphasizing the importance of personal resources and positive appraisals for fulfilling work. Together, organizational support and psychological wellbeing significantly predicted job satisfaction, indicating their joint salience. Findings align with the job demands-resources model, with organizational and personal resources helping mitigate pandemic-related demands to sustain satisfaction and performance. Practical implications point to investing in supportive cultures, mental health provisions, and work-life balance policies to alleviate COVID-related strains as aviation companies rebuild.However, limitations including the small sample size warrant caution in generalizing results.

"Performing proficiency: Applied experimental psychology and the human engineering of air defense, 1940-1965","","Holmes, Marcia E.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2014-01-01","2014","","","","","","978-1-321-43247-3","ENG","During the Second World War, American military strategy depended on servicemen who were proficient users of the sophisticated machines required for air warfare: airplanes, bombsights, antiaircraft artillery, and radar.  Tasked by the US Armed Services to identify men with the requisite traits, experimental and applied psychologists developed rigorous methods for screening and training personnel, as well as techniques for evaluating the design of equipment for its ease of use.  These military-minded psychologists elaborated a new technocratic discourse—a set of assumptions, concepts, and techniques for producing scientific knowledge about human proficiency in operating technological systems—which promised that even the most complex networks of humans and machines could be calibrated to work seamlessly together to achieve unrivaled capabilities.  This dissertation argues that, in spite of their militarized and technophilic motivations, these psychologists did not assume that the ideal human operator would behave like an automaton or a cyborg, but rather they modeled their human subject on the liberal-democratic individual: a discerning, adaptable, and team-oriented decision maker.  As a result, their discourse erected a tension between the affectless cybernetic organism and the creative, coordinative human user of technology—a tension that even now shapes American expectations for how humans should act, and interact, within the increasingly computer-dependent workplaces of industry, finance, the military, and government.    The psychological discourse on human-machine interaction that emerged in World War II shares ideas and strategies with cybernetics, information theory, and operations research, yet it also critiqued these systems sciences for their tendency to elide the ""human factor.""  This critique was most directly articulated within a collection of fields that so far have been largely ignored by historians, fields then variously known as applied experimental psychology, engineering psychology, aviation psychology, and human engineering.  This dissertation traces how these fields of human engineering psychology labored to calibrate the human element in the military's ""man-machine systems"" of air warfare.  It offers three narratives about American psychologists' efforts, during World War II and the early Cold War, to engineer better bomber crews, air defense personnel, and air traffic controllers.  These narratives reveal how the ambitions, conceptual framework, and experimental techniques of human engineering psychology were shaped by the technical and political challenges of finding reliable and accessible measures of human proficiency—i.e., measures of human behavior in relation to mission success—that would satisfy military planners, service personnel, and scientific experts alike.  In pursuing their science of proficiency, human engineering psychologists constructed oppositions between human and machine, information processing and decision making, rigid programming and procedural flexibility, individual-component behavior and system-wide performance that valorized the liberal-democratic human operator over the subservient automaton.  This dissertation casts new light on the epistemic and political stakes of the Cold War's systems sciences by scrutinizing the discourse that underlies the fields of human engineering psychology at mid-century, especially their epistemological concerns regarding validity, reliability and universality in measuring human performance within technological systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1647769650?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=weTgsOmAcyPhARja%2B3AuSjJ%2B6t0%3D",""

These experts may use cognitive frameworks to capture past experience in ways that support rapid pattern recognition, adaptive responses and proactivity. The proposed research approach assumes that experienced pilots will similarly rely on cognitive frameworks to handle information and make sense of complex, fast-moving situations experienced in their information-dense environments. Predictions from Klein et al.'s (2006) Data/Frame Model of Sensemaking were used to evaluate event-based interview data collected from uninhabited aerial system (UAS) pilots and high performance military aircraft pilots (F-16 and UH-60 Black Hawk) in order to assess the methods with which these experts handle large amounts of critical information in their operations. This effort may benefit the sensemaking model, a model based largely on domains in which situations unfold over time and decision-making can be adapted, such as in information operations, nursing and fire fighting, by comparing its predictions with data collected from UAS pilots. The UAS operations domain, in particular, has characteristics that differ from those of domains on which the model is based because UAS pilot sensemaking must support decisions and continuous adjustments of an aircraft operating in a dynamic, potentially complex, and rapidly shifting environment from which the pilot is physically removed. The military aviation domain may be similar to studied domains that some decisions need to be made rapidly, and situations can change rapidly; nevertheless, as a new domain to the model, offers the potential to reveal new insights.

"Towards a Theory of Mind Wandering in Relation to Task Type, Behavioral Responses, and Respective Adverse Consequences in Piloted Vehicles","","Cowley, Jennifer Antonia","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2013-01-01","2013","","","","","","978-1-303-54452-1","ENG","In critical systems, human operators are often responsible for maintaining the safe operation of systems. However, cognitive factors (e.g., affect, attentional resources, fatigue, etc.) can negatively affect the operator’s ability to stay focused on the task and make timely decisions. Although prior research has studied multiple factors that impact performance, such as distracted driving, situation awareness, multitasking, vigilance decrements, etc., mind wandering has yet to be integrated with these factors to yield a more comprehensive theory of human performance. To address this problem, we employed a mixed method, qualitative and quantitative, approach to study performance implications of mind wandering in the context of automobile driving and aviation piloting using undergraduate students and certified pilots, respectively.In Part I, we assessed the degree of unrelatedness required between thoughts and the current task at hand before it was subjectively classified as mind wandering with respect to four types of relatedness (e.g., functional, conceptual, temporal relatedness and thought tense). Using a factor scenario survey approach, high and low levels of each type of relatedness were correlated with participant’s perceptions of mind wandering. It was found that thoughts conceptually unrelated to the task were significantly more often identified as mind wanderings; the only main effect of these four types of relatedness. In addition, there were a few significant interactions with functional relatedness and the tense as well as temporal relatedness. Low functional, retrospective thoughts were more likely considered mind wanderings than high functional, prospective thoughts. Also, low functional thoughts in the distant past or distant future were more likely considered mind wanderings (e.g., low temporal relatedness) than high functional thoughts in the near past or future (e.g., high temporal relatedness). In addition to these relatedness types studied in Part I, thoughts were also categorized on a continuum of task/thought decoupling with on-task thoughts at one end of the continuum (e.g., low decoupling) and mind wanderings that lack meta-awareness at the other (e.g., high decoupling) in Part IV of this research effort. Based on discussions with participants during these studies, the continuum of all thought categories is ordered from least to most decoupled as follows: on-task, off-task, mind wandering and unaware mind wandering. In Part III, we explored whether the level of thought/task decoupling was related to performance decrements in the driving simulation environment. When participants were most frequently mind wandering without meta-awareness which is the most extreme decoupled state, the highest mean number of lane deviations (2.26 deviations) and the second highest mean seconds of speeding (5.53 seconds) were recorded. When participants were most frequently on-task, the lowest mean seconds of speeding (1.17 seconds) and second lowest number of mean lane deviations (1.00 deviations) also resulted. A similar relationship was found in the flight simulation with general aviation pilots even though the frequencies of off-task thinking were lower. When all on-task and off-task thought contents were examined, it was found that when pilots believed their thoughts were on-task, thought decoupling occurred as the pilot moved from high task load situations (e.g., take-off and climb) to lower task load situations (e.g., cruise). During take-off and climb, pilots’ thinking involved actions/behaviors previously executed as well as thoughts about navigation. If poor performance occurred in the take-off phase of flight, thoughts about their performance often appeared during the climb phase of flight. During cruise, thinking became more decoupled from the task (e.g., thoughts about planning and strategizing) even though these thoughts were participant classified as on-task. Thus, as the pilots executed tasks from take-off to cruise, the thoughts gradually became more decoupled.Correlates to mind wandering were also assessed to understand when and why mind wandering may occur. Similar to findings in the prior literature, negative mood was found to be significantly and positively related to higher frequencies of off-task thinking but not mind wandering. Yet, task load, subjective mental workload, task type and working memory capacity did not significantly correlate with frequencies of off-task thinking and mind wandering.Lastly, this work investigated the efficacy of three mind wandering metrics used in prior literature (e.g., all probe, self-caught and probe, and clicker). Efficacy was operationally defined as a metric that from the participant’s viewpoint, facilitated quick task re-engagement, accurately captured the frequency of mind wanderings and did not unnaturally engender excessive meta-awareness. The results suggest that the clicker method was the most efficacious metric followed by the self-caught/probe and the all probe metrics.This mixed method approach sought to build theory about what mind wandering is, when it arises and for what reasons. A framework is needed to understand how the results reported herein overlap with other theory generated about these related phenomena.

The investigation was in the form of three major groups of tasks, each of which was performed by a separate group of pilots. The first set of tasks involved reanalyzing the original paired-comparisons data to determine the consistency of the previous multidimensional solution. The second group of tasks was employed to test various components of the three cognitive load dimensions. A third set of tasks compared the two different psychometric models of multiattribute utility theory and conjoint measurement and scaling to determine which model was better utilized by pilots and which model provided a better measure of predictive validity for cognitive load. The re-analysis provided support for the original multidimensional scaling solution. Results from the second set of tasks indicated that pilots were able to use the dimensions meaningfully and somewhat consistently throughout the battery of tasks. Evidence also suggests that the dimensions are not fit well by an additive model because there exists some level of interaction between the three dimensions of flight function, flight action and sample rate. Further study needs to be done to verify the existence of the same dimensions in other studies, to determine the value of deriving the cognitive load scale, to find a proper model on which to base such a scale and to ascertain the proper situations for implementing such a tool in future research endeavors in the area of human factors.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304611579?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=zl4vMmAtmsuoH7IIBXMJbq1DKl4%3D",""

The full automation condition reported the lowest subjective task load followed by partial automation and then manual condition. IB detection varied significantly across automation condition. The moderate workload condition of partial automation exhibited the lowest likelihood of IB occurrence. The low workload full automation condition did not differ significantly from the manual condition.

The concept of resilience has become an influential and society-wide construct, embraced by the positive psychology movement and impacting on educational, health and social policy significantly and demonstrably. Importantly, the concept of resilience has a substantial historical heritage and legacy and the permeation of the construct within the collective social consciousness is rarely considered or queried, but generally accepted and embraced. Moreover, the construct of resilience within itself is invariably couched within contemporary discourse as a universal good and highly desirable attribute and further still, considered by many as a fundamental component contributing to the fabric of an individual’s character. Design/methodology/approach – The design of this paper is a short review of selective evidence of key conceptual issues. Findings – Resilience as a concept, is defuse, generally ill-defined and highly subjective. The concept of resilience, though popular and intrinsic to a number of aspects of public and educational policy, remains controversial, provides an explanatory account of differential outcomes which may not always be positive and, importantly, may potentially disenfranchise the individual. Originality/value – The synthesis of the brief and selective appraisal of evidence in this area suggests that the concept of resilience, if it exists at all, is highly mercurial, ambiguous in definition and despite its omnipresence as a representation of a positive and internalised attribution to the individual, has a significant negative side which is seldom considered. Querying the concept of resilience against the overwhelming backdrop of positive belief and opinion regarding the concept may represent a social heresy, however, the balance of evidence would suggest a debate about the concept is long overdue and, moreover, the concept itself provides a useful fulcrum to consider where beliefs, attitudes and opinions about abstract concepts stop and science, evidence and fact-based reflection begin.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2117405243?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=dZ0shKzuKWEvbHK5wWKk5DGHy2k%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/JME-05-2015-0015"

"Exploring Consumer Perceptions of Airline Revenue Enhancing Practices","","Martin, Samuel Bryan","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2012-01-01","2012","","","","","","978-1-267-63210-4","ENG","The airline industry in the United States has been characterized by destructive competition and high rates of bankruptcy since deregulation in 1978. Only those airlines that practiced effective revenue management survived. Revenue management and the pressure to increase revenues have produced several practices such as price discrimination, overbooking, and additional fees for checked luggage that have troubled the airline consumer and created intense dissatisfaction as reflected in recent surveys, which consistently rate overall quality of airline travel as negative since 1991. The problem is the negative impact of revenue enhancing business practices that are reflected in consumer attitudes and behaviors. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore consumer perceptions of revenue enhancing practices in the domestic market that have resulted in negative or undesirable consequences. This research study was conducted by interviewing 20 experienced airline consumers residing primarily in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. The study used a semi-structured interview process for data collection and the modified Van Kamm method of data analysis. Four themes emerged from analysis of interview data concerning consumer reactions to revenue enhancing practices: Utility, Disappointment, Resignation, and Indifference. Utility concerned perceptions of revenue enhancing practices that fulfilled a consumer need or were described in a utilitarian fashion. Disappointment concerned revenue enhancing practices that were perceived negatively, sometimes as an outright violation of trust or other psychological human needs. Within this theme, consumer behavior changes could produce negative consequences to the airline. Resignation concerned perceptions of limited consumer choice or available options in response to objectionable revenue enhancing practices. The findings also indicated that perceptions such as these can move to the theme of disappointment if consumer perceptions regarding options change. The theme of indifference indicated a perceived lack of concern regarding certain revenue enhancing practices, especially if there would be no personal effect or consequence as a result. It was recommended that future research include an evaluation of a much larger sample size of airline consumers to include all levels of travel experience in order to better assess variances between major market segments as they relate to revenue enhancing practices.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1053891587?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=W9vERxBH9CzUv2H77a77FyMtwdk%3D",""

The predictors that were included in the research are: biographical data, ABET levels in terms of English and Matric results, as well as results from psychological tests, namely: English literacy skills assessment (ELSA), Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RMP), Blox test, subtests of the Intermediate Battery (B/77) viz: Arithmetic 1 and 2, and Reading Comprehension, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The objective of the research was to determine the predictive validity of the selection battery utilizing the final flying school results as the criteria.The results of the research were inconclusive. Only some of the tests showed positive correlations with the modules of the flying school results. The Ravens Progressive Matrices, Blox, Matriculation English symbol, ABET levels and Reading Comprehension, were found to have predictive power with some of the modules of the flying school results based on the regression analysis.It is recommended that a revised profile for a commercial airline pilot should be developed, as well as that the critical skills and competencies should be identified to enable the airlines to utilize appropriate and relevant assessment tools to select prospective candidates, particularly among the previously disadvantaged communities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3224572501?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=TojLy0Pzv%2B87EcK08Hv3%2BcT6sSo%3D",""

Furthermore, we verified (4) the moderating effect of cabin crew’s previous overseas experience on the relationship between cross-cultural adjustment competency and turnover intention. MBTI-Form M test and a survey questionnaire were distributed to 185 Korean cabin crew members in Middle Eastern airlines, and 172 valid datapoints were used for analysis. It was revealed that the cabin crew members showed significantly different levels of cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, and coping competency depending on their personality traits. Furthermore, those with higher cross-cultural adjustment competency and stress coping are more likely to have positive mental health, which also had an influence on lowering their turnover intention. Occupational competency had no significant association with mental health; however, it directly affects turnover intention.

Identifying unique contributions of any of them is essential, because it leads to a better human error prediction model. Results in this study revealed the influence of a number of contextual factors in prediction of error type frequency.

However, SA has been recognized to be of vital importance in information-processing and decision-making in a variety of other occupations. The present study extends the work of previous authors by conducting research on the effect of personality and stress on the SA of workers in a high-intensity job other than aviation. This study developed emergent medical scenarios and the SA requirements for each scenario. Although, this SA measure demonstrated acceptable content validity, it failed to meet reliability requirements. Data regarding SA, stress (physiological and psychological), and personality were collected from nursing school students who were in the junior/senior year in their programs. A randomized experimental design was used to collect data and test the study hypotheses. In addition to participating in the medical scenarios, the participants were also provided with situation awareness training which aimed at improving their situation awareness, contingency planning, communication and teamwork skills, and stress management. Path analysis was used to test the relationships among personality, stress, and SA and the effect of the situation awareness training on these relationships. In accordance with previous research, the study demonstrated that psychological stress was positively associated with personality factors such as neuroticism. However, due to measurement problems with the SA scales and minimal reactivity of the physiological stress measures, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the relationship of SA with either personality or stress (physiological and psychological). Additionally, results also showed that the situation awareness training did not have the hypothesized effect on the stress-SA relationship. This calls into question the model of personality, stress, and SA proposed by the study. However, before the model, or any of its components, is discarded, further analyses should be performed using new or refined SA and stress instruments. Opportunities for future research are discussed in detail and ideas for the improvement of the study design are proposed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304185684?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=OuN%2FtuA%2B09NCeiUr5vOnYa4JbR0%3D",""

A quantitative, posttest research design was used to determine if either 30 or 60 minutes of instrument flight instruction would significantly improve a noninstrument-rated pilots ability to control the aircraft after entering adverse weather conditions. Sixty-six noninstrument-rated pilots were selected and randomly assigned to one of three groups. The control group pilots received no instrument flight instruction and were required to complete the simulated experiment flight immediately after the 10 minute familiarization flight. The other pilots received either 30 or 60 minutes of instrument flight instruction and were required to complete the simulated experiment flight immediately after the requisite flight instruction. The data were analyzed using a single factor independent design analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine whether there was a significant difference among the groups' means, and Games-Howell pairwise comparisons tests were used to examine the differences between treatment means. The ANOVA indicated there was a significant overall effect ( p=0.0018). The Games-Howell results indicated no significant difference between the control group and the pilots who received 30 minutes of flight instruction; however, there was a significant difference in the experiment flight times between the control group and the pilots who received 60 minutes of flight instruction (p< .05). The increased pilot proficiency was indicated by the shorter times it took various pilots to complete the experiment flight. The more proficient pilots varied off course less than their less proficient counterparts. The results indicated a recommendation to change the Federal Aviation Regulations to require instrument flight during or between the required biennial flight reviews. That recommendation, if implemented, could possibly reduce the number of weather-related general aviation fatalities. It is recommended further investigation be done to determine the deterioration rate of that proficiency, whether a flight training device is as useful as an actual aircraft, and whether the proficiency gained from 60 minutes of instrument flying practice without the aid of a flight instructor would be as beneficial as 60 minutes of instrument flight instruction.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305178464?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=o%2Flg2hcfI4NpBhXVWuoWpwQ1eYk%3D",""

Each participant also rated the scenarios on a series of bipolar scales. Aviators from all groups sorted the scenarios into some similar and some different categories. Greater differences were found in the categorizations made by the two less experienced groups as compared with those of the two more experienced groups. In particular, the less experienced groups' categorizations of scenarios were not as well defined as the those of the two more experienced groups and appeared to focus more on the decision event itself. The categorizations of the two more experienced groups were highly similar to each other and seemed to include considerations beyond the decision event. Specifically, all groups sorted the scenarios in terms of crew coordination/workload and all but the least experienced group also sorted in terms of time/risk. However, the two more experienced groups also considered the impact of the events in each scenario on the overall flight plan.

"Predictive Relations Between Cognitive Abilities And Pilot Performance: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach","","Almamari, Khalid Saif","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2020-01-01","2020","","","","","","9798379682958","ENG","A large body of literature suggests that cognitive abilities are important determinants for training and job performance, including flight performance. The associations between measures of ability tests and job performance have been the focus of many empirical studies, resulting in an overall conclusion that general mental ability, g, is the main source of prediction, while other narrower abilities have limited power for predicting job performance. Despite the attention given to cognitive ability-flight performance relationships, their associations have not been fully understood at the broad construct level, and most extant literature focused on the relations at the observed scores level. Thus, the present dissertation study was designed to contribute to the progression of this understanding by examining the relations between cognitive abilities and flight training performance, using data from four U.S. Air Force (USAF) pilot samples. For comparison, one navigator and one air battle manager sample were also analyzed. The data were obtained from correlation matrices of prior investigations and analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures.Four studies are reported in the thesis: (1) preliminary study, (2) primary validation study, (3) cross-validation study, and (4) cross-occupation validation study. The preliminary study assessed the test battery used in the subsequent predictive studies. The primary validation study introduced a bifactor predictive SEM model for testing the influence of cognitive abilities in predicting pilot performance. The cross-validation study assessed the consistency of the predictive model suggested in the primary validation study, using three additional pilots’ samples. The crossoccupation validation study compared the predictive model using data from three aviation-related occupations (flying, navigation, air battle management). Ability factors were extracted from scores of pilot applicants on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT), the USAF officers’ primary selection test battery, whereas the flight performance scores were obtained from pilot records during the flight training program.In addition to the g factor, verbal ability, quantitative ability, spatial ability, perceptual speed ability, and aviation-related acquired knowledge are the six latent cognitive ability factors investigated in the reported studies. Pilot performance measures were modeled either as observed or latent variables covering ratings of academic and hands-on flying performance in different phases of the training program. The studies of this thesis established that (1) general ability contributes substantially to the prediction models; however, it is not the only important predictor, (2) aviation-related acquired knowledge is the most robust predictor of pilot performance among the abilities examined, with a role even exceeding that of g, (3) perceptual speed predicted pilot performance uniquely in several occasions, while verbal, spatial, and quantitative abilities demonstrated trivial incremental validity for hands-on pilot performance beyond that provided by the g measure, and (4) the relative importance of cognitive abilities tends to vary across aviation occupations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2827706874?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=zuGWcY1okFqIz4cwN0QOT%2BnLzp4%3D",""

"Measuring Cognitive Workload in Automated Knowledge Work Environments","","Frazier, Shree Natasha","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2022-01-01","2022","","","","","","9798379844578","ENG","Automation, as defined by Parasuraman et al. (2000, p. 287), is a “device or system that either partially or fully, accomplishes a function that was previously, partially, or fully accomplished by a human operator.” Traditionally, automation was introduced to (physical) work environments to alleviate workload associated with tedious and repetitive tasks. Over the past few decades, automation has begun to augment knowledge work, which includes high-level cognitive activities. As automated systems expand to perform skill-based tasks, the work required of humans is inevitably altered, potentially affecting their cognitive workloads. Years of research has shown that automation can reduce cognitive workload, but other work suggests that cognitive workload may increase or remain unchanged when automation is introduced. These conflicting results prompt the need for further investigation to better delineate the relationship between automation and cognitive workload.A plethora of factors may explain why the relationship between automation and cognitive workload is inconsistent. Therefore, this research takes steps toward addressing knowledge gaps within the human-automation interaction literature related to understanding how automation used in knowledge work environments affects peoples’ task completion. Specifically, this work investigates how two moderators, task complexity and age, influence the automation and cognitive workload relationship. These moderators were of interest for two reasons. First, task complexity, which occurs when the structure of a task imposes demands on a person’s cognitive processes, increases the demands of a task, which can result in the use of more cognitive resources. Second, age is of interest because advanced technologies are increasingly being utilized by a wide user demographic, particularly the rapidly-growing older adult population.The goals of this dissertation were achieved by employing both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine how (1) automation is assessed in knowledge work environments, (2) automation affects cognitive workload, and (3) task complexity and age moderate the relationship between automation and cognitive workload. These goals were first addressed via the construction of a conceptual framework that describes the effects that task complexity and age have on the relationship between automation and cognitive workload. Next, a systematic review of the humanautomation interaction literature in knowledge work environments was performed to examine researchers’ use of cognitive workload measures. Finally, a controlled-laboratory experiment and a scenario-based survey were conducted to collect data from people of different ages about how task complexity and age influence the relationship between automation and cognitive workload.Findings from the systematic literature review showed that researchers primarily employ subjective and performance measures to assess cognitive workload. Results from the laboratory experiment suggested that automation improved measures of cognitive workload. Also, task complexity negatively affected the relationship between automation and cognitive workload, but age was not found to be a moderator. The scenario-based survey revealed that task performance was similar among younger, middle-aged, and older adults. However, younger adults had a more favorable opinion of automation compared to both middle-aged and older age groups.Overall, this research (1) enhances our knowledge of the relationship between automation and cognitive workload, (2) informs the design of future human-automation studies with strategically selected task types and measurement choices, based on patterns that emerged from the literature review, and (3) can ultimately guide designers in better developing technologies to support people in performing various activities in their work and leisure environments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2838331441?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=D2T9dOPecNsonmrtCDK%2Bn0WN%2FpY%3D",""

Each of the subject was made to relax in supine lying posture and ECG was recorded for 30 minutes in computer for future off-line analysis.Results.There was a significant reduction of inter beat interval variation (p=0.003) with significant (p=0.004) lower p NN50 in the fighter group. The normalized units of LF and that of HF was significantly increased (p=0.002) and decreased (p=0.002) respectively in the fighters. The LF/HF Ratio was also found to be significantly higher (p=0.006) in the fighter group.Conclusion.The results confirm the fact that the fighter population seems to have a sympathetic predominance compared to the control group suggested by a higher resting heart rate and a reduced heart rate variability which may induce cardiovascular diseases at a later stage in life because of stress of flying a fighter aircraft. Thus the fighter pilots should be indoctrinated the importance of methods to improve the heart rate variability at this stage which will be beneficial to their health in the long run.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2848400267?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=nWQ8tLhPWJFUDy%2Bjn%2FkLq5OX%2FGg%3D",""

Pilots were also asked to rate the likelihood that they would collide with traffic on a scale from 1 to 7. Although heading and angle of intersection did have an effect on performance, the results were difficult to interpret, which led to a closer examination of the maps to determine what may have caused such poor performance on several of the maps.

A human performance measure was developed, integrating several significant factors of the train driver, and a theoretical framework specified for train driver was established from an extensive review of the literatures. This framework formed the foundation of the study in order to understand the significant factors influencing the performance of a train driver. Three main domains of human, activity and context were proposed to represent the key indicators of the train driver's performance.The evaluation was conducted on train drivers of a major train operating company (TOC) in Malaysia, focusing only on drivers of intercity passenger trains and freight trains. 229 respondents had participated in the quantitative paper-and-pencil survey conducted, and the data obtained was subsequently analysed using SPSS software. An integrated framework was then tested using structural equation modelling (SEM)-PLS approach in theSmartPLS software to determine the relationship among the significant factors of train driver performance. Fourteen factors were hypothesized and tested under the three main domains, namely fatigue, job related tension (internal and external conflict), job satisfactions, occupational stress and sleepiness, which were grouped under human domain; while driving task and job demand represented the activity domain; and lastly, the context domain consisted of the working condition, safety culture, safety issue, working environment and work facilities.The results indicated that fatigue, job related tension (internal conflict) and occupational stress; under human domain were found to be the significant factors which influence the performance of train drivers. For the activity domain, hypothesis testing proved that driving task, was significant factor. In the context domain; three factors were found to be significant. These include safety culture, working environment and working condition. To summarize, the study identified a total of seven significant factorswhich include occupational stress, job related tension – internal conflict, fatigue, driving task, work environment, safety culture and working condition. However, the results have failed to support the remaining seven factors of job related tension (external conflict), job satisfactions, sleep, job demand, work facilities, and safety issue.Significant to this research was that an integrated Malaysian train driver performance model has been successfully developed for identifying the significant factors that influence train driver performance, highlighting the interaction between human factors, human activities and its context. Through this approach, this study has looked at the significant factors in holistic and comprehensive perspective without ignoring other potential domains of factors. Therefore, this model would benefit the rail industry by assisting them in identifying the factor(s) That require close observation and improvement.

However, while assessments of specific cognitive abilities are considered critical to predicting pilot performance, they do not form part of university admission processes for students applying to flight programs, where attrition rates can be high as 70%. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) three-stratum model theory of cognitive abilities links academic and cognitive performance; however, further research could contribute to stratum modifications by expanding understanding of the relationships between CHC theory information processing abilities and specific human performance. In an independent-sample t test research design, this nonexperimental quantitative study examined the relationship between cognitive predictors and successful solo flight performance of student pilots. The CogScreen Aeromedical Edition neurological assessment was used to determine if cognitive factors are valid and reliable of successful solo flight performance. The study participants were 70 student pilots (a convenience sample) between the ages of 18 and 25, 10 female (14%) and 60 male (86%), selected from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The CogScreen-AE measure was administered to the participants prior to their flight instruction. Flight instructors used the FA121 Flight Training Syllabus to evaluate student performance during their training. At the completion of the training, participants were placed in Solo-Completed (n = 52) and Solo-Not-Completed (n = 18) groups. Independent-sample t tests were used to compare the mean scores between the Solo-Completed and Solo-Not-Completed groups. The test was significant for the three cognitive measures: divided attention t(68) = 3.77, p< .001, speed-working memory t(68) = 6.81, p< .001, and LRPV  t(68) = 17.67, p< .001. The Pearson correlation results revealed that LRPV (r[52] = .32, p< .05) had the strongest relationship of the three cognitive measures. In addition, regression analyses revealed that the LRPV was the most predictive that explained 81% of the variance (R² = .81,  F[1, 51] = 213.15, p < .001) in successful solo flight performance. These findings suggest that these cognitive measures are significant of successful solo flight performance and provide further evidence in support of the CHC theory. It is concluded that applying a cognitive performance measure prior to admission to a flight program may reduce attrition rates, support necessary accommodations, and identify flight deficiencies. Further research should compare results among different university flight programs to confirm the findings and to improve the reliability of the CogScreen-AE as a standardized measure for beginning flight students.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/912202569?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2FKzhxphb1Wbi8QzVNs8qBwbjKI0%3D",""

Thus, FOQA is a powerful aviation safety tool, but FOQA has also raised critical data-protection issues regarding its use for disciplinary or FAA actions, and/or release to outside entities for civil or criminal litigation.  The FAA has a strong desire to expand FOQA, however only 17% of smaller air operators have voluntarily adopted it, and little is known about pilot perceptions of FOQA. Technology improvements and cost reductions have enabled its adoption. The General Accountability Office has maintained negative pilot perceptions are a barrier to further adoption of FOQA.   This is the first comparative research to study pilot perceptions of FOQA. This research hypothesized that public sector pilots flying under a FOQA program would have more positive perceptions, and lower negative perceptions, of FOQA than their counterparts not flying under a FOQA program. No significant differences were found on either the positive perceptions scale,  t(185) = .24, p=.81, or the negative perceptions scale t(185)= 1.56, p=.12. A one-way ANOVA indicated that education level did not have a significant relationship with either positive, F(3.178) = .69, p=.56, or negative, F(3.179) = 1.04,  p=.38 , perceptions of FOQA.    It was hypothesized that pilots with FOQA experience would have higher positive perception scale scores, and lower negative perception scale scores, than pilots operating without FOQA experience. The one-tailed point-biserial correlation indicated that there was no significant relationship between positive,  rpb(142) = .09, p= .14, or negative  rpb(142) = -.16, p= .03, perceptions with FOQA experience.   Public sector small air operators operate in a variety of environments that pose risk to safe operations. FAA's promotion of safety data analysis by air operators through voluntary adoption of FOQA has stalled. If FAA desires to retain global leadership in flight data analysis and safety risk management, they should initiate new action to reenergize broader adoption of FOQA including the protection of sensitive safety information from litigation discovery, and the reevaluation of FOQA as a voluntary safety program.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1427924646?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=gt0uJdbBIwX6BXnzA9yuShkxwFQ%3D",""

Thirty certified flight instructors from the Institute of Aviation at the University of Illinois flew a series of trials using one of three cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) formats. A coplanar (two-panel) format displayed two orthogonal views of the airspace, a conventional top-down view, and a view looking forward from behind the pilot's aircraft which provided a spatial-analog representation of altitude. Two perspective projection formats (one using a 30$\sp\circ$ viewing vector elevation angle, the other using a 60$\sp\circ$ viewing angle) provided integrated exocentric views of the airspace from above and behind the pilot's aircraft. The pilots were instructed to fly to a navigational waypoint displayed on the traffic display, and to deviate from their flight path as necessary to maintain safe separation from conflicting traffic. Traffic approached from a variety of trajectories which were designed to either conflict with, or miss the pilot's aircraft. Results indicated that the coplanar format generally supported better conflict detection and avoidance performance than did the perspective displays. Additionally, the approach trajectory of the traffic interacted with display format to affect the types of maneuvering strategies used by the pilots, as well as their success in avoiding conflicts. The results reported here are contrasted with the findings of previous research which has shown comparative advantages for perspective displays over planar formats which have used alphanumeric and symbolic codes to represent altitude.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304361389?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=WQdOgbNoxhLm%2FPT860%2FYNM52bgc%3D",""

Flight crewmembers under a high job demand environment manifest a wide variety of fatigue symptoms, which has been highly correlated to the burnout syndrome subscale of exhaustion. The highest levels of burnout occur due to imbalances between high job demands and low job resources. Therefore, variances between low job resources and high job demands of flight crewmembers may be precursors of the burnout syndrome. The purpose of this nonexperimental, quantitative study was to explore relationships between the environmental dimensions of scheduled overnight cargo flight crewmembers performing within Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 121 and the burnout subscales. Data were collected from 558 flight crewmembers. The Wilcoxon tests,  p values (0.000) of flight crewmembers, who experienced role conflict, quantitative work overload, qualitative work overload, autonomy, and organizational politics, indicated there were statistically significant differences in the burnout subscales. In addition, the p values (0.315; 0.82) of flight crewmembers who experienced role ambiguity and fair rewards, respectively, indicated that there was no statistical difference in the level of professional efficacy. Quantitative work overload and organizational politics had the strongest statistically significant correlations with the subscale of exhaustion ( p = .351; p = .312) respectively, as well as, the cynicism subscale (p = .220; p = .302). In addition, qualitative work overload had the weakest positive correlations with all burnout subscales. Recommendations for aviation administrators include readdressing work policies and practices that directly affect the areas of work and rest scheduling parameters, redefining job description responsibilities and duties, improving management and labor relationship while maintaining a fair reward system, and enhancing any internal decision support system utilized by flight crewmembers. Longitudinal research may allow researchers to better understand the impact of the environmental dimensions on burnout over time, while focusing on individual factors, such as demographics. Finally, more research focused on the level of burnout of scheduled overnight cargo flight crewmembers performing under FAR Part 121, unscheduled cargo flight crewmembers, and scheduled airline passenger flight crewmembers, is needed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1513968954?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ld1h3JT8Nl62QelcizNMAeRxRSA%3D",""

By putting a systematic selection system in place, it helps to ensure that the best possible candidates fill open positions in the field. Specifically developing a selection system to train and acclimate future pilots while they are in a university setting will not only help select top-tier candidates into the aviation program, but also prepare them for what to expect when they enter the job market. This research study built upon two iterations of a pilot selection battery for a Midwestern university aviation program. Participants completed a battery that was then used for research purposes to obtain information about the potential predictors of pilot performance. The measures include the IPIP Five Factor Scale, Assertive Interpersonal Schema Questionnaire, Cockpit Management Attitudes Questionnaire, Proactive Personality Scale - Short Version, Block Counting Measure, and Rotated Blocks Measure. Additionally, flight instructors evaluated their students based on several aspects of effective performance. Data from 30 student pilots were examined with bivariate correlations and linear regression and the results from the current sample indicated that a pilot personality profile, assertiveness, proactivity, cockpit management skills, and spatial reasoning did not consistently predict flight performance.

The primary question that was addressed in this study is whether the general public would board a commercial aircraft with the knowledge that the aircraft is unmanned. In order to research this question, the researcher explored the age, gender, and educational differences of the general public as to their values, attitudes, and beliefs towards this topic of humans flying on unmanned commercial aircraft. A fixed research design by means of quantitative correlational research method of a specific population of randomly selected participants of the general public was used to analyze the research questions. From a determined population size of 100, the researcher conducted a power analysis to determine a sample size of 60. From the analysis conducted, it would appear that females felt a little less educated regarding the concept of unmanned commercial aviation and this may be due to a lack of interest in the technological fields. Additionally, participants with less than a bachelor’s degree also felt a little less educated about unmanned aviation. Overall, it would appear that the general public feel well educated regarding the concept of unmanned commercial aviation with no significant difference (smallest p = .285) indicating that the three educational groups did not significantly differ on their average agreement or disagreement on any of the aviation questions. This study concludes that there was no significant difference between different age groups, gender, or educational levels. However, there is still room for more education to be provided in the schools and colleges, as well as from the airlines and manufacturers regarding the safety of the technology used on modern day aircraft. If airline customers expect to attract future unmanned flyers, they must begin to familiarize the general public with the concept within the next couple of years so as to avoid commercial impact due to empty seats on the proposed concept.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2187136310?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=yqT7TxYej2gPvJR7U72y4Si3kjo%3D",""

Correspondence was defined operationally as the degree of similarity between the objective significance of a situation and a pilot's mental representation of that situation. Subject-matter experts derived criteria for correspondence and performance using Federal Aviation Regulations to identify the objective significance of several situations embedded within a full-mission aviation simulation. Correspondence was measured empirically by comparing the objective significance of each situation in the simulation (i.e., criteria) with a pilot's mental representation as revealed by responses to knowledge-based questions. T-tests were used to assess correspondence and performance relative to the criteria generated by subject-matter experts. In addition, this research tested whether the level of pilot knowledge, as defined by pilot certification level and amount of actual IFR experience, affected the frequency with which a pilot established correspondence. T-tests were used to assess the hypothesis that pilots with higher knowledge levels [i.e., Certified Flight Instructor-Instruments (CFII)] would demonstrate correspondence more frequently than pilots with lower knowledge levels (non-CFII). Relative to the 13 non-CFII pilots, the 12 CFII pilots established strong correspondence more frequently and they performed better. Measures of correspondence and performance enabled the development and utilization of matrices that were used to analyze the relationship between correspondence and performance. This analysis revealed several instances of dissociation between performance and correspondence, and it challenges the practice of using performance measures solely to infer causality between SA and performance. Furthermore, the correspondence-performance matrices allowed for the categorization of pilot behavior and the derivation of specific solutions to safety-related issues.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304604317?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=B5cset3j7nWg61LBo%2Fhw4DTJ%2BNc%3D",""
"After the last flight: Exploring airline pilots' transition to federally mandated retirement","","Schallow, Gwen N.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2008-01-01","2008","","","","","","978-0-549-42474-1","ENG","The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore the retirement experience of airline pilots as they transition to life following mandatory retirement. The voices of twenty pilots provide the essence of their experience. Five broad context theme clusters emerged during analysis of the data accumulated during pre-retirement and post-retirement interviews, including retirement planning, fear of the unknown, post-airline employment decision, I'm not an airline pilot anymore, and  pre-retirement vision versus retirement reality. After retiring from the airline, eighteen of the twenty participants sought new employment, thus the transition was not to a stereotypical retirement. Pre-retirement torpor and fear of the unknown often contributed to the participants' delayed planning of post-retirement activities and the consideration of post-airline employment. Those who did not secure post-airline employment prior to leaving the airline reported feelings of waiting for their next trip or being on vacation for several weeks. This vacation period was followed by a period of boredom, listlessness, and melancholy that lasted between one day and five months. This latter period ended when a decision was made to seek employment, but returned if employment was not immediately secured. Despite an anticipated shortage of pilots, more than 9,000 pilots will be forced to retire at the age of 60 between the years 2007 and 2011. This research has implications for pre-retirement planning and out-placement programs, healthcare providers and insurers, volunteer agencies, educational institutions, mental health counselors, financial planners, and for the development of niche retiree-focused businesses and service organizations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304823369?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=EBRRzImPxhE%2FRMFzfU8%2BV6DnYxU%3D",""

Thus, in order for interface designers to truly design for the user, they must first have a way of deriving a representation of what the user knows about the domain of interest. The current study evaluated three techniques for eliciting knowledge structures for how General Aviation pilots think about weather information. Weather was chosen because of its varying implications for pilots of different levels of experience. Two elicitation techniques (Relationship Judgment and Card Sort) asked pilots to explicitly consider the relationship between 15 weather-related information concepts. The third technique, Prime Recognition Task, used response times and priming to implicitly reflect the strength of relationship between concepts in semantic memory. Techniques were evaluated in terms of pilot performance, conceptual structure validity, and required resources for employment. Validity was assessed in terms of the extent to which each technique identified differences in organization of weather information among pilots of different experience levels. Multidimensional scaling was used to transform proximity data collected by each technique into conceptual structures representing the relationship between concepts.   Results indicated that Card Sort was the technique that most consistently tapped into knowledge structure affected by experience. Only conceptual structures based on Card Sort data were able to be used to both discriminate between pilots of different experience levels and accurately classify experienced pilots as “experienced”. Additionally, Card Sort was the most efficient and effective technique to employ in terms of preparation time, time on task, flexibility, and face validity. The Card Sort provided opportunities for deliberation, revision, and visual feedback that allowed the pilots to engage in a deeper level of processing at which experience may play a stronger role. Relationship Judgment and Prime Recognition Task characteristics (e.g., time pressure, independent judgments) may have motivated pilots to rely on a more shallow or text-based level of processing (i.e., general semantic meaning) that is less affected by experience. Implications for menu structure design and assessment are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/875539441?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ehkQudHlz7Dwtqz2nSOIANz3lvo%3D",""
"What role does emotional intelligence (EI) play for superior performers in the international business of a capital -intensive, asset-based industry?","","Mount, Gerald John","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2000-01-01","2000","","","","","","978-0-599-80371-8","ENG","In an increasingly competitive global environment, organizations are showing a renewed interest in how individuals create and sustain organizational capabilities for competitive advantage. This study demonstrates that emotional intelligence competencies are critical to the successful planning and execution of international business in a capital-intensive, asset-based industry. The study's population comprised employees whose responsibilities ranged from idea conceptualization to revenue realization, in a capital-intensive, asset-based, international petroleum company. Data were collected from a sample of superior and typical performers in the roles of Strategist, International Business Developer, International Negotiator, International Business Service Manager, and Worldwide Project Manager in a vertically integrated organization. Data collection methods included behavioral event interviews (BEIs), focus groups, and a standardized competency questionnaire. A secondary analysis was conducted of randomly selected interviews to determine the relationship between individual performance and the intrinsic motivation phenomenon of “flow” (optimal experience), often associated with superior performance. An analysis of the data found ten competencies and six unique skills/expertise characteristics related to successful international business activities. Three of the competencies were classified as cognitive (IQ), seven as emotional (EQ), and six unique characteristics as skill/expertise (S/E) competencies. These competencies identified behaviors that, if replicated across the organization, would create an international capability. The study also indicated that flow characteristics were not limited to superior performers but were likely to be experienced by typical performers as well. The strength of the study derives from (a) its foundation across a series of responsibilities that create a valued capability, (b) an empirical data collection process, which minimized personal bias in the identification of differentiating competencies, and (c) a standardized database to identify, measure, and assess the competencies. Its contribution to the discipline is to clarify the role of emotional intelligence in critical functions by substantiating the interpersonal contributions of EQ competencies in creating specific organizational capabilities. These competencies describe behaviors that provide the sense of direction, self-confidence, and means to leverage other capabilities to influence outcomes in a way that is personally satisfying and organizationally valued. The hidden value of EQ is that it provides a foundation for performance, which itself evolves from achievement and socialized power motives.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304674046?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ef54udbVEPSc4%2FwVpxxkbY1jsYM%3D",""

Current aviation industry standards for the assignment of personnel to aviation-safety departments vary from company to company.  A person is placed into a safety position by a director of safety or human resources or by a manager of authority.  The problem is the lack of governmental and industry requirements and qualifications for aviation-safety professionals to control risk and prevent accidents.  Aviation-safety professionals have no mandated regulatory requirements based on education level, professional licensing and certification, and competencies.  The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative relationship of core competencies, education, and professional licensing and certification of aviation-safety professionals in commercial and transportation aviation industries.  The non-experimental mixed methods comparative study focused on the criterion variable of core competencies and the predictors of education, professional certification, professional licensing, and the skills and abilities necessary to function as an aviation-safety professional.  The target audience for this study was a sample size of 524 aviation-safety professionals in U.S.-based aviation companies.  These aviation-safety professionals acted as the competency generators to examine the necessary core safety professional competencies required to manage commercial and transportation aviation-safety programs.  With three statistical tests for reliability, the conclusions and results revealed a high degree of reliability in support of the core safety competencies of education, professional licensing, and certification of aviation safety professionals in commercial and transportation aviation industries.  The results suggest future research by other researchers or professionals in the areas of aviation safety or for possible dissertation topics by new doctoral students for study with different survey populations such as government, industry, and/or academia.

Utility analysis can also be extended to situations in which workforce productivity changes as a result of an organizational intervention. In the present study utility methods were applied to an organizational change within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that attempted to improve the workflow of aviation safety inspectors. The On-line Aviation Safety Inspection System (OASIS) allows FAA safety inspectors to log inspections using portable computers.The study estimated potential timesaving in dollars after the workflow change. Three utility estimation procedures were compared for the case in which there was data on timesaving as a result of the workflow change. One of the methods was a commonly accepted procedure that used a literature-based rule to estimate a scaling factor for the conversion of job performance to a dollar metric. The other two methods calculated the financial value of saved labor cost using parameters estimated by a sample of job incumbents.All three methods of estimation converged toward similar values of total benefit. An examination of the error variances of the estimates led to the conclusion that when estimates of timesaving are made one should calculate values for utility using multiple methods to avoid relying on information from parameters that might be unstable.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304344835?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Pp2pdLxl9MVEptTiIA%2BMD%2BnfRqE%3D",""

To date, much of the quantitative empirical research suggests that organizational, relational and environmental factors influence career transition behavior. However, while we know that these external influences may cause an individual to transition, we know less about the process through which career transitions evolve, especially those of larger magnitude and how forces internal to the individual may help to explain variance above and beyond these external factors. In this dissertation, I use qualitative and quantitative methodologies to develop and refine a model of career transition focusing on career transition magnitude. Specifically, I use research from social identity, social networks and role exit theory to develop a model of career transition magnitude that posits career identity (the cognitive representation of the self derived from past career experiences, beliefs, values, attributes and motives that define the individual in terms of their career) and network characteristics (the pattern of interpersonal relationships) influence the magnitude of intended career transition, the career exit behaviors one engages in and the evaluation of career opportunities. Further, I use path analysis to find that career exit behaviors are influenced by the magnitude of the intended career transition as well as strong coworker ties and social and personal turbulence. Additionally, I find that the favorable evaluation of career transition opportunities is impacted by career identity centrality and organizational satisfaction. Finally, I find that the magnitude of the intended career transition is influenced by the favorable evaluation of transition opportunities, network career range, organizational satisfaction and social and personal turbulence.

The problem to be addressed in this study is that while college students generally experience high-stress levels, university aviation college students have unusually high-stress levels. The purpose of this quantitative non-experimental single group pre-test post-test study was to examine the effectiveness of an aviation stress management course in reducing students’ perceived stress levels and to examine the impacts across age, gender, race, and year in school at a small private aviation university in Northern Arizona. The Yerkes-Dodson law and the cognitive appraisal model are two theoretical frameworks that tie together the relationships between student stress, academic performance, and success. A non-experimental quantitative research method, coupled with a single-group pretest-posttest design was used to sample 63 aviation students who had previously taken an aviation stress management course. Secondary historical data was collected on students’ perceived stress levels before to and after taking the aviation stress management course. The research questions pertained to exploring impacts an aviation stress management course had on student perceived stress levels, and student perceived stress levels across age, gender, race, and year in school. The results indicated a significant reduction in student perceived stress levels based on the pretest-posttest results. Additionally, female students had significantly higher stress levels compared to male students, however, there were non-significant results across age gender, race, and year in school. Stress management education is widely overlooked in higher education but can have a significant impact on student success. Further research on the impacts stress management education has on not only aviation college students but all college students alike should be considered.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2708956063?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=FaFCqsmgZtyfceuxIdbxOAENYh8%3D",""

Compared to non-pilots, pilots detected more malfunctioning instruments, had shorter dwell times on the instruments, made more transitions, visited task-relevant areas more often, and dwelled longer on the areas between the instruments. These results provide evidence for three theories that explain underlying processes for expert performance: The long-term working memory theory, the information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception. In addition, the results for generic attentional skills indicated a higher capability to switch between global and local information processing in pilots compared to non-pilots.

This research attempted to narrow the focus of where, within the active pilot population, to look for some of the factors that may be associated with an age-related increase in the risk of becoming involved in a general aviation accident. Data were formally analyzed through use of a two-group discriminant analysis. The dependent (criterion) variable was age. The independent (classification) variables were twelve pilot human performance variables in three divisions of the cognitive system: information processing variables attention/ distraction, memory/forgetfulness, judgment/decision making, and communication; psychological variables habits, motivation, fear/panic, complacency, and personality; and skills/training variables training, experience, and currency.

The focus of this study was to determine how the degree of simulation difficulty affects teamwork. With a unique high fidelity simulation lab, the participants completed 3 hour work shifts to a run a simulated regional airline. Teamwork was based on the following five variables: contributing to teamwork, interacting with the team, keeping the team on track, expecting quality, and having the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's). The experimental design consisted of three teams randomly assigned to either a minimal, moderate, or maximum level of difficulty. After completion of the simulation, the participants completed an online survey for evaluations of their performance. The findings suggest some components of teamwork are affected by the design of the simulation, while others are not as susceptible to its effects. It was discovered the level of difficulty significantly affected individual and group performance in their expectation of quality and having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's).

"Fighting The Fire In Our Own House: How Poor Decisions Are Smoldering Within the U.S. Fire Service","","Cavnor, Charles","Homeland Security Affairs","Scholarly Journals","","","","2018-03-01","Mar 2018","n/a","","","1558643X","","","ENG","Oftentimes, organizations declare employees to be their greatest asset. Workers engaging with others in their insular workplace achieve organizational goals through collaboration, and establishing and developing a localized work ethos. However, when work processes are strained by supervisory production demands, performance of the local workgroup can adjust to accept risk that makes safety negotiable.[1] Incremental and leisurely erosion of safety-centric workplace processes can influence and drive an entire institution to analyze and perform actions under aberrant decision-making frameworks. This thesis seeks to understand how high-risk occupations, especially the U.S. fire service, potentially adopt and eventually contend with the normalization of deviance.The concept of normalizing deviance within high-risk vocations was first examined in depth after the 1986 space shuttle Challenger disaster by sociologist Diane Vaughan. Vaughan’s analysis of the tragedy disclosed several sociological failures within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that contributed to poor decision-making.[2]At the organizational level, normalization of deviance elucidates the social construct of workplace catastrophes.[3] Decisions that would otherwise appear illogical outside NASA were seemingly rational inside the agency, as the boundaries of normality had been widened to accommodate incremental failures and near misses now fell within the boundaries of acceptable performance.[4] Delineating between unsafe acts, near misses, incidents, and accidents is crucial to understanding the escalation of occurrences, and their cumulative effect upon an organization.[5] Additionally, understanding how organizations are structured and operate, from either a linear or complex construct, provides a level of clarity as to potential problems encountered. Furthermore, the belief that organizations can conceivably exist in a pre-accident period, called an incubation period, is examined for legitimacy.[6]Another major theme explored is the abstraction known as a drift into failure. This framework suggests that organizations methodically and slowly make incremental changes that direct the organization towards the boundaries of safety, which challenges those borders with increasing frequency.[7] A reviewed accident causation model is the Swiss Cheese Model, which seeks to define the conception of defense in depth, and how active and latent failure pathways can defeat such protective layering.[8] Finally, consideration is given to the idea of the overall effects of either loose or tight coupling on organizations; specifically how these organizational characteristics can either help or hinder business continuity and operations.[9]Chapter IV delves into whether normalization of deviance exists within high-risk organizations. The principle of production over safety as a stark reality encountered by high-risk organizations, and its contributive effect on workplace justification of shortcuts are examined. Shortcuts sometimes give rise to satisficing, implying that people choose an easier way as opposed to the best way to solve a problem.[10] Structural secrecy as an insulating mechanism against outside influence is considered as influential to promoting normalized deviance.[11] To evaluate the U.S. fire service effectively and fairly, and particularly the Dallas Fire Rescue Department (DFRD), evaluative criteria are established to determine whether normalization of deviance exists in the fire service.The fifth chapter opens up with a discussion of annual firefighter Line of Duty Death (LODD) statistics that reveal consistent mortality rates despite innovations within the fire service industry, such as the Incident Command System.[12] Decision-making paradigms on the fireground are examined that might explain perpetual LODD, including violations of existing rules and regulations that place firefighters at elevated risk of injury or death. Loss of situational awareness is reviewed as a possible factor in fireground injury or death.[13] The concepts of both goal seduction and situation aversion are analyzed to verify if either advance unsafe fireground actions.[14] Next, the idea of a safety culture within the fire service is inspected and how a firefighter’s identity is based on both internal and external influences.[15]The sixth chapter specifically examines the DFRD for instances of institutionalized deviance in its internal documents and training resources used in both initial and operating platforms. After action reports (AARs), in addition to manuals of procedures and standard operating procedures are reviewed. Also, a study of almost 2,000 injury claims over a 17-year period is reviewed. Finally, specific instances of safety breaches are analyzed for conformity to firefighting best practices. The chapter concludes with a review of documents external to the DFRD and their potential relevance to the overall discussion of permitting deviant mindsets on the fireground.The final chapter seeks to draw conclusions and offer specific recommendations to assist the DFRD in restraining normalized deviance. Four conclusions and three recommendations are presented that provide pragmatic solutions to outstanding issues. Conclusions range from initiating in-depth studies of near miss incidents and increasing overall situational awareness, to an acceptance that organizational drift towards failure is manifest within the fire service in general and the DRFD in particular. Recommendations include accepting a resilience engineering approach to understanding accidents by embracing a modified risk matrix model that aligns more with the reality actually observed. Next, a proposal to initiate an anonymous near-miss reporting system is examined, including a draft form that captures incidents that occur more frequently than accidents. Quantifying and documenting such events can scope the size of the issues leading to the near miss. Lastly, the recommendation to summarize and document more everyday incidents in an abbreviated AAR is suggested, including a shortened AAR form that can be collected and analyzed.In closing, the thesis seeks to understand how deviant behaviors progress to such a degree that they actually persuade how unsafe work is performed in high-risk occupations. Focusing on the fire service, normalization of deviance is the tragic end state of a long-term turning of a blind eye to workplace productivity over safety coupled with an almost unabated allowance of local workgroups to construct dangerous subcultures that are permitted to thrive. While the fire service has the public perception of being quintessential risk takers in limited situations, normalizing and allowing risk to infiltrate the mundane decision making paradigm of the firefighting profession is a dreadful thought. The recommendations of the thesis advance practical solutions that ideally expose organizational drift into failure before a more systemic normalization of deviance settles into the fire service organization.[1] David L.

CTM is the process by which pilots selectively attend to high priority tasks and shed non-priority tasks. Twenty seven pilots enrolled in a university flight technology program were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Pilots flew pretest and posttest simulated flights on an FAA approved flight training device (FTD). Twenty potential task prioritization errors were embedded at 14 locations within the flight scenarios. Pretest CTM performance of the two groups was comparable. During a two week period between pretest and posttest simulated flights pilots in the experimental group participated in a CTM training course designed and taught by an FAA certified flight instructor and pilots in the control group did not. A Mann-Whitney U test rejected the null hypothesis that there was no difference in posttest CTM errors between the groups, indicating a positive training effect for experimental group pilots. Longer term training effects were not evaluated. Different cognitive processing models described various pilot behaviors; some behaviors were described by single channel theory, some by single resource theory, and others by multiple resource theory. Mispriotization due to the interruption of an aviate task by a communicate task occurred more frequently than interruption of a navigate task by a communicate task. Fixation on the GPS navigational system caused more than half the pilots to deviate from primary aviate tasks to attend to the secondary navigate task. Additional research with different participants is recommended. A study comparing training results between pilots who have different training backgrounds is also recommended. A longer time period between pretest and posttest and/or a longitudinal study is recommended to test for longer term training effects. Qualitative studies could also be used to enhance experiments, such as gathering responses from participants to discern the extent of their learning. Further studies using cockpits with higher levels of automation and complexity, such as new generation flat panel or 3D cockpit displays is recommended.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305449814?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ewE2QsiWculsdGhN73grChEwyJ4%3D",""

All aviation bodies have experienced loss of life and total destruction of aircraft during their respective operations. Historical research indicates that some pilots make egregious errors (Bisignani, 2010; NTSB, 2010; Boeing, 2009) when they do not complete checklists and ultimately deviate from normal procedural practices during high-stress events.  Why otherwise competent and qualified pilots make these kinds of egregious errors is elusive and has escaped the grasp of quantitative researcher understanding. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews so pilots could tell their stories and share their perspectives on why they had to repeat a simulator evaluation checkride. Through the lenses of the pilots' perspectives, the pilots' voices established a database from which data were coded, compared, categorized, further coded, and analyzed using grounded theory methodologies as espoused by Corbin and Strauss (2008). Qualitative analysis generated substantive theory grounded in the data. Two conceptual models are presented to support the substantive theory. The substantive theory indicates that pilots can become so distracted by abnormal and nonstandard events that their awareness of what needs to be done next is overshadowed by those distractions. In other words, pilots lose their situational awareness and engage in non-standard activities that result in process errors. Pilots must learn distraction mitigation strategies to maintain their focus and avoid becoming overtasked. This theory is presumed to be transferable to other high-stress professions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1614189555?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=LAYGU%2F0ZmdmADdIvJBreu%2FMwtDU%3D",""

Attempts by the FAA to modify this enmity, utilizing various programs, have proven substantively unsuccessful. This work was undertaken to seek to better understand why such attempts have not provided real improvement in the overall labor management situation in air traffic. Its overall purpose is to offer a means by which to eventually transform the current deterministic system of the FAA, to a purposive or heuristic one. More specifically, this research approach: (1) examined the nature and the behavior of deterministic systems, (2) proposed an alternative methodological approach to the standard empirical one currently used in studying organizations, (3) explored the reasons why bureaucratic systems, such as the FAA, resist fundamental changes that are necessary for their continuing existence, and (4) contemplated historical and organizational consciousness issues that help to articulate desired approaches to the design of the future of the air traffic system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304402253?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=BzkhG5oQJvIDSe%2FzskgwbYj3MZg%3D",""

There have been many incidents and accidents as a result of these challenges to human performance. In previous studies pilots have admitted to performing non-flight related activities in order to deal with these challenges. However, no research has been done on the frequency and perceived safety effects of non-flight related activities. If pilots are engaging in activities intended to counter these challenges, it is important to know the frequency and how pilots feel these non-flight activities affect safety.    This study used a survey tool to gather information regarding non-flight related activities from airline pilots in the United States. Participants provided data on frequency of non-flight related activities, perceptions of their safety effects, opinions on the activities related to automation complacency, boredom, and fatigue, and general information on the positive and negative outcomes of these activities. Results suggest that pilots routinely engage in non-flight related activities during cruise flight and perceive most of the activities to be safe. In addition, pilots believe that these activities help to prevent boredom, which then helps to prevent automation complacency and fatigue. Pilots seem to understand that these activities can have negative safety implications, but overall have more positive outcomes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1030433815?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=XjksCvZNU5XN9RgkDLD1MbryazQ%3D",""

During a flight, a pilot samples multiple displays for information about the task at hand. It is imperative that the changes in the displays are being correctly viewed by pilots to ensure a safe flight. However, it is unknown how much change blindness affects pilots or if pilot expertise plays a role in change detection. A change blindness experiment was performed with twenty four participants divided into two groups based on expertise. Expert pilots were defined as instructor pilots with an average of 952 flight hours and novice pilots were student pilots with an average of 80 flight hours. There were a total of 24 images that were presented to participants during a flicker paradigm that was used to induce change blindness and assess change detection within cockpit instruments by the pilots. Images were static depictions of the primary cockpit displays. Results showed that there were no significant differences between expert pilots and novice pilots when detecting change in displays. The results did show that there was significant difference in location display. It was found that the ADI was the most commonly viewed display with other instruments slower in terms of detection. No difference was found for accuracy in all cases.

The research examined whether perceived risk influences the service expectation and perception gaps that may exist for both business and non-business air travelers relative to their perceived service quality. Service quality was used as a measure of customer satisfaction. It was concluded that regardless of air traveler type, there exists the influence of perceived risk. The air traveler’s travel purpose and service quality were found to be correlated. Significantly, perceived risk and perceived service quality were found to be negatively correlated: As perceived risk increases, the perceived service quality decreases for each of the five dimensions of service quality. The negative correlation however is moderate. The study is consistent with earlier research on “sudden negative events”. It validates the correlation between certain elements of risk (financial, performance, physical, psychological, social and political), and service quality dimensions of Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy. It empirically reveals the gap between the perceived importance of a risk element and the perceived recurrence of that risk in the foreseeable future. It further validates the use of service quality as a measure of customer satisfaction. This research potentially provides guidance for management to enhance processes that can maximize service quality in U.S. air travel. Not only should management do its utmost to increase air traveler satisfaction, it should not ignore the influence of perceived risk on perceived service quality.

As pilots gain experience with the information provided in modern cockpits, they selectively adjust their attentional focus. Information that is redundant to primary information, but easier to use, results in the primary information seldom being sampled, for example relying on the flight director to the exclusion of the glideslope and localizer.A task created for these studies required subjects to perform a tracking task and report anomalies in a set of redundant cues. Subjects moved a cursor up a screen passing through the horizontal midpoint of eight pairs of squares. An additional pair of more closely spaced dots marked this midpoint accurately for the first 200 trials. On 10% of the next 200 trials the dots were offset (left or right) from the center of the squares. These studies examined the reliance on the easier-to-use dots. It was shown that subjects perform poorly in the detection of an offset of the dots, when this information has proved to be reliable. The redundancy that is designed into the system and is required to be used is actually ignored.The long-standing finding in the vigilance literature is that operators typically change their decision criteria over time. This change results in a reduced probability of signal detection. With this task, after experience without a failure subjects had the same decision criterion, yet were less likely to detect the failure due to omitting the check for the presence of an offset.The reliance on the more easily used information was examined in automated and manual control conditions. The findings show that with adequate feedback and low workload, automated control does not degrade nor contribute to failure detection.These findings have critical implications for flight deck design, pilot training, and testing. The implications are discussed and suggestions are offered to improve failure detection.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304293396?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=vCd9f805N%2B7u%2BLPWrddoXV5aUFw%3D",""

In the current environment of dwindling resources, funding for experiments requiring large sample sizes, a normal requirement for between-group designs, is becoming difficult to find. However, the need to improve safety within the aviation industry is an ongoing requirement, especially as advances in technology continue have an impact on how the industry operates. SCDs are experimental designs that require very few participants and therefore have the potential to save time and associated costs.The first paper reviews published articles in three prominent journals to determine the types of experimental and quasi-experimental designs commonly used in applied aviation research and to compute a post hoc statistical power analysis for each experiment. The review shows that between-group experimental and quasi-experimental designs dominated applied aviation research and most designs lacked statistical power to detect medium and small effect sizes. SCDs were introduced as efficient alternative designs for many applied aviation studies.The objective of the second paper is to examine if the results from an SCD produced similar findings to those in the between group designs. To do this, a between-group experiment was replicated using a SCD. The results from the SCD and between-group experiment were similar. However, a cost analysis suggests the multiple baseline design (MBD), the specific type of SCD used, is more cost effective.The purpose of paper three is to compare two different types of SCDs, the MBD and a combined design, which combined the MBD with a standard SCD, known as the ABAB design. An applied aviation experiment was replicated to compare the two designs in terms of, internal and external validity, visual and statistical results, and cost. The comparison suggests that the results were similar, and that internal and external validity may be improved by the replication of phases in the combined design. However, the improvements came with a considerable increase in cost of resources and time.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1508267677?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2Bn7uAM3qL2qbf97FlbWAGQWhRHM%3D",""

While psychometric studies have been conducted in training programs administered by the airlines themselves, little research has been done in this area on the processes and tools used by the FAA. The limited research that has been conducted suggested that the interrater reliability (IRR) of current assessments could be questionable. A version of the instrument currently in use by the FAA and two other instruments were used by active FAA inspectors who viewed eight videotaped scenarios of staged cockpit activities. Generalizability Theory (GT) analysis (Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, & Rajaratnam, 1972) was chosen because of its ability to address multiple error sources in a single analytical framework. The main effect for raters was less than expected, normally a sign of good MR, but a substantial interaction effect was found between raters and the rating situation. An expected substantial effect was found between types of instruments, but the individual performance of each was found to be nearly equivalent in terms of allocation of error sources and generalizability coefficients. Further substantial situation-dependent effects were found when analyses were conducted for individual scenarios. The findings that the assessments made by these raters were highly variable between situations and types of instruments suggest problems with construct validity and definition of the dimensions of performance being evaluated. While there appears to be some consistency in the patterns of overall scoring, there appears to be considerable ambiguity with regard to measured constructs and related operational definitions that underlie the instruments' scales.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304912634?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=CCYKXgAfOw1LIFGSO9mmXMnHTFc%3D",""

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) deployed the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program in 2006 to identify passenger behavior indicative of a possible security threat. I hypothesized that (1) U.S. passenger screening is moving towards the Israeli model, which gives priority to behavior detection and requires security interviews with all departing passengers, but (2) logistical and cultural obstacles prevent the United States from fully adopting Israel's model. To test these hypotheses, I compared Israel's current passenger screening measures with those in the United States just after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and in 2010. I found that TSA desires to emulate Israel's strategy and developed SPOT based on the Israeli system, but obstacles, such as the American reliance on technology for security and the size and scale of the American commercial aviation industry, prevent TSA from fully adopting Israel's behavioral screening model. Based on these findings, TSA should implement personal security interviews for passengers on high-risk flights and expand behavior-detection training, but also continue to use traditional screening methods such as metal detectors and x-ray machines. This thesis emphasizes the need for additional research into the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of behavior detection compared to other new screening methods. TSA should also examine the importance of the security interview within the broader analysis of passenger behavior to ascertain the extent to which passive observation of passenger behavior alone is sufficient to determine intent.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/822142506?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=uutY4fxe5972EJX%2Fbb54mIjQHSY%3D",""

A convenience sample of 132 current and former U.S. Military Pilots from across the country and every branch of service responded to an 81-item online survey that contained personality measures of assertiveness and aggression, an aviation safety attitude measure, and demographic questions. Preliminary Pearson r correlations found that overall trait aggression correlated with the aviation safety attitude among current and former military pilots. A linear regression analysis confirmed overall trait aggression as a possible predictor of the aviation safety attitude of risk orientation, F(1, 130) = 4.344, p = .039 (R2 = .032).

In addition, it is generally known that such male-dominated industries have minimal female representation at their managerial levels. One such male-dominated industry in South Africa is the air traffic control (ATC) industry. Women represent about 30 percent of the industry, which suggest their status in the industry is still quite low.The purpose of this study was to examine male and female air traffic controllers’ perceptions of factors that facilitate and constrain women’s career advancement, and to determine whether there were any significant differences in their opinions. The study also identified what male and female air traffic controllers (ATCOs) think the industry can do to help prepare women for leadership positions in the industry, and how to eliminate barriers that may exist to women’s career advancement.Data for this study were collected through an online questionnaire adapted from Zhong’s (2006) study on a convenience sample (N = 147) of male and female ATCOs in South Africa. The data analysis was executed by using factor analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Content analysis was used to analyse the two open-ended questions.The findings from the ANOVA suggest that there were four significant gender differences in perceptions of the Personal effort/External support, Attitude/Internal character, Equity, and Family issues. There also were significant differences in opinion on External support/Personal effort, Attitude/Internal character, Equity and Family issues, depending on the number of children the respondents had, and significant differences of marital status on the External support/Personal effort and Family issues. Finally, significant differences were found in the years’ experience variable for Attitude/Internal character.In response to the open-ended questions, most of the respondents suggested that the ATC industry should offer training programmes to improve awareness of possible barriers within the industry, as well as to offer advice on how to overcome them and improve their leadership skills. This could be done by creating programmes on the knowledge and skills needed to advance one’s career or by providing mentors or role models.Future research could compare the perceptions of employees from different race groups and their perceptions of women’s career advancement in male-dominated industries. It is also recommended that researchers conduct in-depth qualitative interviews together with the current questionnaire to evaluate perceptions of the career advancement of women more critically.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2901487429?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3aHqiJGlaBvca%2FXIWQtSRtzkStQ%3D",""

Despite its importance to health and professional performance, research on stress in crisis management remains scarce. The present study aimed to investigate self-reported stress and psychophysiological stress responses in crisis managers. For this purpose, 30 crisis managers were compared with 30 managers from other disciplines, in terms of self-reported stress, health status and psychophysiological reactivity to crisis-related and non-specific visual and acoustic aversive stimuli and cognitive challenge. Crisis managers reported lower stress levels, a more positive strain-recuperation-balance, greater social resources, reduced physical symptoms, as well as more physical exercise and less alcohol consumption. They exhibited diminished electrodermal and heart rate responses to crisis-related and non-specific stressors. The results indicate reduced stress and physical complaints, diminished psychophysiological stress reactivity, and a healthier life-style in crisis managers. Improved stress resistance may limit vulnerability to stress-related performance decline and facilitate preparedness for major incidents.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1728359259?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=5tGyFwWSJYQRECNQ6iSFlTIXRhk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-015-9654-1"

Participants were 6 college student pilots with instrument rating. The task consisted of flying flight patterns using a Frasca 241 Flight Training Device which emulates a Cirrus SR20 aircraft. The main dependent variable was the number of checklist items completed correctly per flight. An alternating treatment, multiple baseline design across pairs with reversal, was used. During baseline, the average percent of correctly completed items per flight varied considerably across participants, ranging from 13% to 57% for traditional paper checklists and ranging from 11% to 67% for digital checklists. Checklist performance increased to an average of 90% for paper checklist and an average of 89% for digital checklists after participants were given feedback and praise, and continued to improve to an average of nearly 100% for paper checklists and an average of 99% for digital checklists after the feedback and praise were removed. A slight decrement in performance was observed during a post-experiment probe between 60–90 days. Visual inspection and statistical analysis of the data suggest that paper checklist accuracy does not differ significantly from digital checklist accuracy. The results suggest that graphic feedback and praise can be used to increase the extent to which pilots use both digital and paper checklists accurately during normal workload conditions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305033035?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2BAKwSJWXMStadCWXEyZhEIcJwZs%3D",""

The central research question and sub-question focused on the lived experiences of repair technicians’ decision-making perceptions. The naturalistic decision-making framework, decision theories, and decision-making models comprised the lens to assess the impact of aviation maintenance technician decision-making perceptions in aviation safety. Data were collected using semistructured interviews with 12 aviation repair technicians in a maintenance repair and overhaul facility. Transcribed interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Five themes emerged: decision-making experience, decision-making application, importance of decision-making, technician job experience, and decision-making influence. Four subthemes also emerged: situational awareness, aviation hazards, aviation safety, and personal safety. Recommendations for future studies include conducting the study in aviation repair facilities abroad and specifically targeting female aviation technicians for comparison and studying the effectiveness of current training and safety programs.

"Quantitative Analyses and Empirical Tests of Perceptual Theories of the Black Hole Illusion","","Jakicic, Victoria","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2023-01-01","2023","","","","","","9798342100779","ENG","The Black Hole Illusion (BHI) is a nighttime aviation landing illusion where pilots overestimate their descent angle. The BHI occurs when only the outline of the runway is visible to pilots, usually at night with little illumination of the environment. This illusion is dangerous, as it causes pilots to perceive themselves at a high descent angle; and they compensate by flying lower, resulting in a possible crash into the ground or obstacles before the runway. A common interpretation of the BHI is that it represents a perceptual illusion, where the descent angle is misperceived. We quantitatively analyzed two different perceptual theories that predict pilots perceived descent angle during the BHI experience; and we also quantitatively analyzed another perceptual theory to apply during nighttime approaches to alleviate the disorientation experienced from the BHI. Of the first two theories, Perrone's algorithm (Perrone, 1983) predicts that the magnitude of the illusion should vary with runway width/length in nighttime conditions, compared to no illusion and no effect of runway width/length in daylight conditions. On the other hand, the eye-level algorithm (adapted from the work in Galanis, Jennings, and Beckett (1998) and Robinson, Williams, and Biggs (2020)) predicts that there should be no effect of runway width/length in either nighttime or daylight conditions. The last algorithm, the focus of expansion algorithm (adapted from the theory of Gibson (1950) and Gibson (1966)), details a way that pilots can obtain the landing position of their aircraft without estimating their angle of descent, thereby alleviating possible disorientation experienced during nighttime approaches. Additionally, we conducted three empirical studies: The first two aimed at testing Perrone's algorithm and the eye-level algorithm; and the third aimed at testing the focus of expansion algorithm. Across the first two empirical studies, we did demonstrate a BHI for the nighttime evaluations of descent angle; but the data did not support either algorithm. In the third empirical study, the data did not support the focus of expansion algorithm; however, we found that participants were more accurate with estimating the aircraft's landing position when the landing position was closer to the beginning of the runway. Overall, we conclude that the BHI may reflect general disorientation in conditions with limited information.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3126037117?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=adyH7m%2BMuSUUvpYaEV87OjPfNrk%3D",""

In addition, team mental models had a significant main effect on performance, such that the increased accuracy and sharedness of situation mental models, the increased sharedness of teamwork mental models, and the increased accuracy of taskwork mental models resulted in higher levels of performance. Surprisingly, the increased sharedness of taskwork mental models was also found to decrease performance. Finally, contrary to previous findings, the effect of team mental models on team performance was not moderated by environmental condition.

The data was collected from in-depth interviews with 67 airline staff (including 23 women pilots), participant and non-participant observation and written documentation on the aviation industry.The study aimed to critically examine the difficulties faced by women pilots working within commercial aviation.  The intention was not simply to confirm problems encountered by women working within male-dominated environments and present recommendations to management, but to identify the location of future developments in equal opportunities.The findings show that commercial aviation continues to be dominated by masculine values and practices which result in the earlier stages of pilots' careers being treated as a rite of passage.  The stressful and unsupportive atmosphere created problems for male and female pilots, but the difficulties were exacerbated for women by sexism, high visibility and isolation.  In contrast to male pilots, women also had to prove their competence during subsequent checks, courses and flights.The thesis summarises the recommendations made to management, but demonstrates the limited potential for improving the conditions encountered by women pilots through conventional equal opportunities policies and other management initiatives.  It also highlights the problems of relying on professional women who are in a minority to promote equal opportunities.In conclude that future feminist research on gender should focus on women who are in a position to challenge existing discourses and target recommendations at women's groups, unions etc., rather than management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1819524666?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=6%2FytQeQlUnSwZcKjDQMGy1MY4Qw%3D",""

Data have shown that GA accidents associated with visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) are more likely to result in fatalities than other types of GA accidents.  This problem is compounded by the addition of passengers, who have been found to be present onboard during VFR into IMC accidents more frequently than in other types of GA accidents.  The question is whether passengers influence a pilot's decision to continue flight into adverse weather.  The extent other individual factors play a role in a pilots' decision to continue through adverse weather, including prior experience (i.e., flight hours), basic weather knowledge, decision-making, risk perception and tolerance, and the ability of the pilot to assert themselves in the cockpit were explored.  To examine these questions, social pressure by passengers during flight was manipulated to encourage pilots to continue or divert from adverse weather.   Results conclude that the distance the pilot continued into the weather for positively motivated pilots (persuaded to continue) increased, and decreased for the pilots who were negatively motivated (persuaded to divert).  The significant findings of persuasion on distance into the weather were compounded by the lack of awareness of the pilots on the impact of the passenger on their decision making behavior.  Additional findings suggest that private pilots with instrument ratings are continuing further than either the low time VFR pilots or the high time commercial and/or ATP pilots.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/871226428?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=KCb8M%2FoeQ3nlWYdwt9jdW4LjIAM%3D",""

Both a framework for understanding and a method for measuring SA were derived in order to integrate formal theory with the understanding of pilots. Research was conducted over four phases. After an initial phase in which 28 elements considered constitutive of SA were generated by both a literature review and semi-structured interviews of pilots, these were validated in a second phase through the expert ratings of flight instructors and academic researchers. A Principal Components Analysis of the 22 remaining elements was then undertaken in a third phase, which rendered a six-factor core. The factor structure was found to be stable across phases of flight (i.e., departure, cruise, and arrival) and generalizable between groups (e.g., flight school students, air transport pilots). The usability of the scales was addressed in a fourth phase, where flight school instructors were asked to assess in-flight/in-simulator and post-flight/post-simulator applicability. This resulted in a final version of the Cranfield Situation Awareness Scale (Cranfield SAS) and a shortened prototype for in-flight and in-simulator use. The scales derived were 'Pilot Knowledge,' 'Anticipation and Understanding of Future Events,' 'Management of Stress, Effort, and Commitment,' 'Capacity to Perceive, Attend, Assimilate, and Assess Information,' and 'Overall Awareness'. A framework model for understanding SA was then proposed which would integrate the Person-Environment pit model of stress offered by French, Rodgers, and Cobb (1974) with Neisser's (1976) perceptual cycle in order to address the interaction of factors. Situation Awareness was said to be the 'operational space' within which personal and environmental factors affect performance.

Unlike conventional voice-based air traffic control (ATC) communications technology, the CPDLC system will allow pilots and controllers to exchange text-based messages via specifically designated data links. Instrument-rated pilots ( N = 30) were tested on both a series of CPDLC text command tasks and a series of conventional voice command tasks in a simulated flight environment. Measures of performance were response time and number of errors made in pilot recall/execution across the command condition (voice or text) given the level of command workload (high, moderate, or low) and order of flight presentation (voice or text first). Results revealed a statistically significant decrease in both errors in pilot recall/execution and response times in moving from the conventional voice ATC commands to the CPDLC text commands. Results were significant across all levels of air traffic control command loads (high, moderate, and low). However, a conservative post hoc analysis revealed no significant decrease in pilot response time at the moderate load ATC command level. The results of this study supported the view that human performance can be improved when complex information was presented in visual form and users can refer to the text again. Further data analysis revealed that while pilots responding to the high parameter load text commands had both significantly fewer errors and reduced response times than when responding to the high parameter load voice commands; this performance effect appears to diminish at the moderate and low command workloads. Results lend support for a text-based communications technology which extends pilot's working memory, thereby improving both accuracy and efficiency in performing flight tasks to complex commands.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304608712?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Ga8%2FHZkj2LyG0Ts1xaqCnpoKjiw%3D",""

It aims to inform organizations about safety matters by using trained ATC staff to take a structured look at everyday operations. By monitoring normal operations through the use of direct over-the-shoulder observations, it is believed that safety deficiencies can be identified in a proactive manner prior to the occurrence of accidents or incidents.\nNOSS was developed as a collaborative effort between the International Civil Aviation Organization, ATC providers, controller representatives, government regulators, and academics to fill a gap in available ATC safety information.  System designers consider three basic assumptions: the technology needed to achieve the system production goals, the training necessary for people to operate the technology, and the regulations that dictate system behavior.  These assumptions represent the expected performance. When systems are deployed, however, particularly in realms as complex as ATC, they do not perform quite as designed. NOSS aims to capture the operational drift that invariably occurs upon system deployment.  NOSS captures how the ATC system operates in reality, as opposed to how it was intended to operate.\nNOSS is premised on the Threat and Error Management (TEM) framework. TEM frames human performance in complex and dynamic settings from an operational perspective by simultaneously focusing on the environment and how operators respond to that environment. TEM posits that threats and errors are a part of everyday operations in ATC and must be managed in order to maintain safety margins.\nThis dissertation describes NOSS and its contributions to ATC safety management systems. It addresses the validity and reliability of NOSS data and presents case studies from field trials conducted by a number of ATC providers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1524722386?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=2xlIFS6xuF7xZPHhw2CLcW%2BfekY%3D",""

Some of those variations can push the human body to some limits, which associated with psychological factors may culminate in incidentes or even fatalities. Actually, a literature review on this theme suggests that a significant part of the incidents and fatalities, within the light aviation that uses non-pressurized aircraft cabins, are related to the human factor. This analysis might bring up a concealed but significant and worrying phenomenon in terms of flight safety: changes of pilot performance in the amendment of psychological and physiological parameters, concerning to diferente stress levels and to pressure variations during the various flight stages, respectively. This may be a concerning situation due to the disparity of human body reaction between diferente pilots to the same flight conditions. Nature, both in terms of environmental factors, as pressure and temperature, or in human physiological and psychological behaviour, during the different flight phases, is unpredictable. Therefore, it is very difficult to establish safety boundaries.This study general objective is to analyse the influence of flight environmental conditions and pilots psychophysiological parameters on task performance, during different flight situations, considering some of his everyday habits. To this end, a statistical analysis of a survey, regarding specific questions about the need for pilot’s attention monitoring systems, was made, and, in parallel, a portable and ergonomic monitoring system was built. This system equipment records cerebral oximetry, to study the hypoxia phenomenon and its importance, electrocardiography (ECG), and electroencephalography (EEG), in order to establish a correlation between the influence of mental workload and other physiological parameters during different flight stages.The specific purpose of this study is to define physiological limits for each pilot, through simulation tests contemplating different flight scenarios, in order to create an on board alert system to prevent possible incidents.With this research is also intended to suggest that a potential restriction on pilots licensing legislation for light aviation, within physiological limits definitions, would be a positive contribution to a safer flight environment.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2583004378?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3ulAlakIfosSiVFTB2WYQfD0LZw%3D",""
"Evidence based fatigue risk management during 24/7 operations: Objective assessment of pilots' sleep, performance, and fatigue during ultra long range and long range flights","","Wu, Lora J.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2013-01-01","2013","","","","","","978-1-303-46617-5","ENG","Ultra long range (ULR) commercial flights are longer (greater than16 hours of flight time at least10% of the time) than long range (LR) flights (8 to16 hours of flight time), perhaps increasing the potential for fatigue-related performance deficits. Both ULR and LR flights are flown with augmented (3 or 4 pilot) crews to allow for in-flight rest. The purpose of this study was to measure the sleep, performance, and subjective sleepiness and fatigue in commercial airline pilots as they flew ULR and LR flight pairings. We compared the amount of sleep obtained, performance on a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), and subjective rating of sleepiness and fatigue in the same pilots during ULR and LR flight pairings. N=74 Boeing 777 pilots were studied continuously during adjacent ULR and LR flight pairings. While controlling for flight duration, there was no significant difference in the amount of in-flight and sleep obtained between ULR and LR flight pairings. After controlling for layover duration, there was no difference in the amount of sleep obtained during layover between ULR and LR flight pairings. Pilots obtained more sleep while away from base during ULR relative to LR pairings, even after controlling for the time away from base. There was no significant difference in reported levels of sleepiness and fatigue during ULR and LR flight pairings. There was no significant difference in PVT speed throughout the flight during ULR and LR flight pairings. Results suggest that ULR flights are not inherently more fatiguing than LR flights despite the longer duty times associated with ULR operations. The methods used can be translated to a data-driven fatigue risk management system.

Specifically, the study focuses on problems that these aviators encountered and examines what information and strategies were used by these individuals in dealing with their issues. Eleven experienced F/A-18 naval aviators were interviewed using the Critical Decision Method. Data from these interviews was then analyzed in two steps: (a) first, separately for each participant (within-participant analysis); and then (b) across participants (between-participant analysis) in order to identify themes and patterns that emerged. Additionally, two member checks occurred during the study, after each step of data analysis. Findings of the study address the following six areas: (a) the types of problems that arose; (b) how the aviators identified problems as novel or unexpected; (c) how the aviators first identified the existence of a problem; (d) cues and factors that were noticed and considered by the aviators throughout their decision making process; (e) strategies utilized by the aviators; and (f) difficulties that the aviators encountered in selecting and implementing these strategies. Findings of the study are discussed in relation to the literature on decision making, aviation, and human factors. Support is found for Klein's Recognition-Primed Decision model, Orasanu and Fischer's Aviation Decision-Process model, and Endsley's work on situation awareness. Additionally, the findings identify the importance of two contextual factors in the aviation environment that have not been addressed previously: (a) the purpose of the flight (combat versus non-combat); and (b) the flight operation environment (shore-based versus carrier-based). These two factors were found to influence each other in addition to impacting the saliency of certain cues and factors for the aviators. Based on these findings, a model of the Aviator Decision Making Process is developed, thereby contributing to current aviation decision making theory. Implications of the findings for practice are discussed, including the importance of educating aviators on cues and factors that they should be considering in various types of situations, such as when flying off of aircraft carriers or engaging in combat. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also provided.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304998438?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=kg5z2Bh%2BZZdX5dIBlylXXyPYRLA%3D",""

Previous research has shown primary attention is given to presignificant event training and stress management, however there remains an important gap in the current literature regarding postsignificant event stress within the aviation profession. The purpose of this cross-sectional quantitative study was to use the observational lens of stress theory and survey U.S. pilots who have experienced an inflight emergency, looking for correlation between factors such as age, gender, flight experience, and training against a pilot's self-reported level of residual stress. Using snowball sampling methodology, 101 pilots were anonymously surveyed, with 89% responding that they had some level of residual stress via the Impact of Event Scale-Revised instrument. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the correlation between 9 personal and professional characteristics and pilot's stress level was significant, at R2 = .22, adjusted R 2 = .14, F(9, 91) = 2.8, p< .01. The sample's correlation coefficient was .47, indicating that approximately 22% of the variance in the residual stress was accounted for by the 9 personal and professional characteristics. Findings from this research will help clarify how pilot training and demographics can affect postsignificant event stress. This knowledge will be an important contribution to the existing literature and enhance social initiatives though an increased awareness of residual stress within the pilot profession. The results can be used to increase aviation safety by enabling the industry and government entities to develop and implement effective stress training initiatives.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2018876458?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=FqXP8bYV9H%2BiICEVM%2Bn7reH17%2Bs%3D",""
"The 1g mental model invoked by General Aviation pilots and its implication in inadvertent stalls","","Jungemann, Jeff","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2009-01-01","2009","","","","","","978-1-109-69385-0","ENG","Low altitude stall/spin accidents continue to contribute a high proportion of fatalities associated with General Aviation (GA) flight operations each year. One scenario in particular, often referred to as a ""Moose Stall"", involves maneuvering flight at low altitude in order to spot and track a particular target of interest on the ground. A combination of channelized attention and increased complexity in the flight dynamics associated with steep-banked maneuvering flight places a pilot in a situation where he may not normally operate and where his awareness of aircraft performance may be degraded. Error taxonomy posits a heavy reliance on previous behavior for both automatic and problem-solving performance. A mental model, developed to a large extent by past experience, can be considered the basis for such behavior. By assessing situation awareness (SA), it is possible to gain insight into a pilot's mental model in order to highlight potential deficiencies that may contribute to errors involved in maneuvering flight. This study examined the SA of sixteen novice and expert pilots over varying degrees of maneuvering flight in a fight simulator. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) instrument was used to query pilots about their awareness of specific flight parameters. A 3 x 2 mixed experimental design was used to assess within differences in awareness during maneuvering flight with increasing bank angles (5, 25, and 45 degrees of bank) and awareness differences between two levels of experience (novice and expert). Additionally, a performance maneuver compared aircraft control techniques between novice and expert pilots during a steep-banked, low-altitude, level turn. Analysis of the SAGAT data revealed novice pilots displayed decreased awareness as bank angle increased while expert awareness remained relatively stable with increasing bank angle. However, a lack of difference between novice and expert awareness led to the conclusion that novice and expert pilot mental models were different and that the SAGAT technique, which focused on perceptual SA, did not fully capture expert mental models that may involve better comprehension of flight dynamics. The performance maneuver was inconclusive due to perceptual limitations associated with the flight simulation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/89156374?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=joyf3P011T%2FKO1r06AOdNdCeTwM%3D",""

Estimating the design and outcome of a study to evaluate these new tools can be tricky as there are many new variables for which there is little to no data. However, sometimes even after careful vetting of scenarios in the simulator prior to bringing subject-matter experts into the simulation facility, few to no metrics of statistical significance can be found. While it may be valid that there are no metrics of statistical significance, it is perhaps a missed opportunity to take advantage of the precious time and resources of having a subject-matter expert at the research facility. The research presented in this paper has developed a software tool for simulating a pilot’s visual perception of working in various configurations of cockpits. This may provide researchers insight into what types of scenarios and tactics would be of interest to use with real subject-matter experts. In other words, this should help identify the best use of resources to take advantage of having pilots at the facility and avoid scenarios/procedures that don’t generate data of interest. Another useful possibility with this tool is identifying cockpits that may be inefficiently designed. Instruments that should be grouped together can be easily identified by analyzing the eye-scan pattern of the model with different cockpit-configuration files. The results that this new software-evaluation tool provides have implications for several different evaluations beyond estimating pilot reactions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2185961096?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3pdzGyQ7tH%2B7vOpyZ649FcSEHY0%3D",""

Understanding distributed cognitions in HROs offers the potential promise of avoiding disaster. HROs such as military aircraft, nuclear power plants or emergency surgical wards must develop and share resilient collective cognitive structures capable of making sense in increasingly complex technologically dependent environments. Operationalizing Bougon's (1992) Theory of Congregate Cognitive Maps (CCM), the first CCMs for an HRO, more specifically a Coast Guard C130 Aircraft engaged in Law Enforcement and Search and Rescue were constructed. Findings suggest that despite changing participants and despite differing beliefs and assumptions of diverse participants, resiliency and reliability in organizations can be achieved by learning the language of congregation, that is, a specific grammar and syntax to organizing. The CCM is the organization and it can be manifestly utilized for organizational development and improvement. Distributed cognitions and collective actions, as the product and process of organizational learning, fosters discovering and interpreting new information that assists adaptation, renewal and learning. Characteristics of resilient sensemaking are believed to be manifest within the supporting congregate cognitive maps (CCMs) of HROs. Cognitive mapping offers the methodological access to describing the complex relationship between the content and structure of individual participants and congregate cognitive mapping now affords a method of describing the organizing collectivity such as the collective knowledge in specific action domains such as aerial law enforcement. Relating the deep collective cognitive structure embodied within CCMs to collective sensemaking affords an opportunity to pursue an operational construct of resilient distributed cognitions and collective action.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305336389?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=OB%2F5Sd0pQtVifLNTp%2FNrlEbSIok%3D",""

The lifting of many travel restrictions such as negative testing for COVID-19 in 2022 paved the way for the recovery of air traffic and the desire to travel awakened in many. Private travellers in particular created an unexpectedly high demand for air travel for which the entire industry was not prepared. However, long-term stored aircraft, lack of ground and cockpit staff and the shift in demand regarding Economy Class, Premium Economy Class and Business Class travel led to new problems in 2022.Due to the area of responsibility of the revenue management department in Munich, the cuts caused by this new disruption could be observed continuously. The central task of the department is to achieve the highest possible revenue with the available capacity of the aircraft. Due to the shift in demand towards seats in premium compartments (Premium Economy Class, Business Class), refitting the cabins of the long-haul fleet is a more topical issue than ever. In addition, staff shortage continues in the industry, which has led to commercial cuts in 2022 such as the suspension of overbooking of flights.

This research is a comparative study between cockpit stress and aeronautical decision-making (ADM) among nonprofessional general aviation pilots and professional pilots, utilizing quantitative methodology with nonexperimental methods to establish both a comparison and a correlation between cockpit stress and ADM among professional and general aviation pilots.  The topic is important to the field of psychology and, more specifically, to the I-O psychology specialization because the cockpit represents a work environment where stress impairment can impact pilot performance and wellbeing.  ADM requires a significant amount of mental energy that is not always utilized efficiently, even among professional pilots, and studying the differences among these groups of pilots can add to the knowledge that already exists.

"The effects of weather recognition training on general aviation pilot situation assessment and tactical decision making when confronted with adverse weather conditions","","Kim, Chansik","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2011-01-01","2011","","","","","","978-1-124-85335-2","ENG","Previous general aviation (GA) accident studies showed that decision errors were more associated with fatal GA accidents than other kinds of human errors, and weather related accidents, especially continued visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), remained the major cause of fatal GA accidents. Thus, finding the underlying causes of GA pilots' decision errors and continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions are needed to reduce weather related GA accidents as well as fatal GA accidents.  Causal factors and hypotheses of weather related GA accidents show that knowledge, experience, motivation, and weather information frequently have been referred as causal factors of weather-related GA accidents. Among causal hypotheses, situation assessment and risk assessment hypotheses have been cited frequently as the causes of weather related GA accidents.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of weather recognition training on GA pilots' situation assessment and tactical decision making under gradually aggravating weather conditions. To meet this purpose, WeatherWise and an X-Plane 9 flight simulation program has been used. WeatherWise is a computer based weather training program developed by Wiggins et al. (2000) to improve GA pilot weather-related decision making, and was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for free public use.  Pilot situation assessment is a pilot's understanding of a current flight state, and was evaluated in terms of weather assessment and risk assessment. Weather assessment is the pilot's ability to recognize or estimate the changes in visibility, ceiling, and weather condition. Risk assessment is the understanding of the risks associated with flying in adverse weather conditions, and was measured in terms of risk perception and risk tolerance using the Hazardous Event Scale, personal weather minimums, and the Aviation Safety Attitude Scale. Pilot situation assessment was measured by a post experiment questionnaire.  Pilot tactical decision making is in flight judgment, and was evaluated in terms of decision accuracy and decision confidence. Decision accuracy was evaluated by measuring the distance that a pilot has flown from an optimal divert point to an actual divert point, and the distance a pilot has flown into adverse weather conditions. Decision confidence is the pilot's confidence level in making diverting decisions when the pilot encounters adverse weather, and was measured by subjective rating method.  Findings of the study indicated that the WeatherWise training group exhibited significantly higher weather assessment as measured by ceiling estimation ability and decision accuracy as measured by flown distance into adverse weather condition than the control group, but no significant differences were found in their risk assessment and decision confidence. Although the effects of weather training on the risk assessment were not significantly different between the two groups, participants in the WeatherWise training group was more conservative toward flying into adverse weather condition than the control group.  It was hypothesized to find a positive relationship between pilots' situation assessments and their tactical decision-making because situation assessment forms a basis for decision making; however, positive relationship was found only between pilots' ceiling estimation and flown distances into adverse weather in this study. Thus, it can be concluded that the weather training was effective at least in part to pilot situation assessment and tactical decision making. In addition, considering the weather training was just one-time 30 minute training, long-term effects of weather training should be conducted to find further relationship between pilot situation assessment and tactical decision making.  The results of this study can be expanded not only to GA pilots but also to commercial airline pilots and military pilots for various reasons. First, all pilots are expected to acquire weather recognition skills and knowledge to ensure a safe flight regardless of their flight types because the nature of weather condition changes is dynamic and hard to predict during the flight. Second, although those aircrafts are well equipped with navigation aid systems and weather display radar, they do not provide real–time weather information, and they sometimes malfunction.  In conclusion, it is expected that this study will be helpful for GA pilots to understand the effects of weather recognition training on weather decision making, and eventually help them assess a situation correctly and make a timely in-flight decision. It is believed that this study will help to establish a sound foundation for weather training program and has the potential to reduce weather-related GA accidents by implementing weather training during flight training.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/893084975?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=K6yrUHaa401XFdTjR3TN95iPR1o%3D",""

Background: Previous studies have examined the association between helicopter parenting and college students' well-being. However, less is known about how the multidimensional construct of helicopter parenting is related to college students' mental health across Western and Eastern cultural contexts. Method: We conducted three-step latent class analyses using nine helicopter parenting indicators for 1,386 mother-child and 1,214 father-child groups in the United States and 520 mother-child and 454 father-child groups in China.

However, SA—as it is called—is at best a cryptic psychological construct. The basis of this research study was rooted in the belief that the identification of related psychological processes and other factors would contribute to the conceptual development of SA as well as add to its theoretical stature. The study was conducted at a North-Central University's College of Aviation. Participants were selected from various programs within the college and at different academic levels. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 consisted of 184 participants who took the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI; Schraw & Dennison, 1994) and the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES; Sherer, Maddux, Mercandante, Prentice-Dunn, Jacobs, & Rogers, 1982). Phase 2 consisted of a subset of participants from Phase 1 of the study (N = 54). Phase 2 participants were administered the WOMBAT (Wondrous Original Method for Basic Awareness Testing)-CS Situation Awareness Stress Tolerance Test (Roscoe & Corl, 1987; Roscoe, Corl, & LaRoche, 1999, 2001). Findings indicated that while there was no association between metacognition and SA or between self-efficacy and SA, there were statistically significant correlations between metacognition and self-efficacy (N = 184, r = .576, p< .001) and between flight hours and SA (N = 54, r = .354,  p< .001). Flight hours also contributed significantly to the variance associated with SA (r2 = .194, adjusted  r2 = .179, p< .001). Based upon these findings the following conclusion were drawn: (a) experience, as defined by flight hours, plays a significant role in measures of situation awareness; (b) WOMBAT provides an approach for pre-testing participants' levels of situation awareness and stress tolerance prior to accumulating flight experience; (c) this study forms a suitable base for explanatory and experimental studies; and (d) the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory and the Self-Efficacy Scale do not appear to be appropriate proxies for situation awareness measurement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304707996?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=WSbtSquEZ95c6hYnFDY92mmD8bw%3D",""

Following the tradition established by his record-breaking father Sir Malcolm Campbell, Donald mounted a series of record attempts in a succession of vehicles names Bluebird, setting his first record on Lake Ullswater in 1955, and becoming the only person to hold both the land and water speed records in the same year, 1964. He died on 4 January 1967 attempting to break the 300-mph barrier on Coniston Water. Campbell’s exploits attracted attention not only in Britain but around the world, yet his projects and speed record-breaking have received little scholarly examination.The thesis examines how Campbell funded and promoted his record attempts, his construction as a celebrity and speed record-breaking as a media spectacle, across four chapters, engaging with scholarship on heroic reputations, media and celebrity, sport and motoring, and on national decline. Chapter one charts Campbell’s changing media representation in the media in print and in radio, newsreels, and television. Speed generated a compelling spectacle focused on the ‘Speed King’ Campbell, a British hero. My study of media representations and papers in the BBC Written Archives reveals the vital role Campbell himself played in crafting his image, supporting Sharon Marcus’s recent emphasis on celebrities’ influence over their public profile. The thesis analyses Campbell’s early promotion of an alleged ‘Water Barrier’ at 200-mph, similar to the Sound Barrier, to generate suspense and scientific legitimacy. Campbell projected the image of a modernised gentleman, combining the traditional elements of style and courtesy with the glamourous lifestyle of a playboy, of fast cars, attractive women and exotic foreign travel. The chapter reveals how diminishing success, arguments with sponsors, the absence of fresh spectacle and middle age generated increasingly negative commentary in the 1960s, as Campbell focused more on the vastly more expensive – and difficult – land speed records.Chapters two and three examine the organisation, sponsorship and promotion of Campbell’s records. Chapter two situate Campbell in the burgeoning motor cultures of the period. My research shows how Campbell was treated as an expert on speed in Britain and around the world. Although he only achieved one land speed record, Campbell was always associated with motoring and frequently compared with racing drivers like Stirling Moss. Adverts portrayed a modern gentleman, used to promote a range of motoring products and fashion accessories, who contributed to the rise of what I call ‘conspicuous motoring’. Although he was associated with danger, campaigners used Campbell as an expert on speed to promote road safety. Far from the vanity projects of a wealthy eccentric, chapter three analyses a range of business archives to show how private companies and the state backed Campbell’s projects to promote national prestige, specific products and technological innovation. Drawing on David Edgerton’s model of a ‘Warfare State’, my research shows how the British state provided support through loans and patronage.The final chapter examines responses to Campbell’s death, which was extensively recorded in written reports, photographs, films, and audio. The subsequent media spectacle re-energised interest in Campbell, securing his reputation as a national hero in a tradition of British pioneers, particularly explorers who risked their lives for the honour of the nation and for science. Debate about the causes of the disaster generated more downbeat assessments, emphasising the end of an era and portraying Campbell as an anachronism in the Space Age of the later 1960s, a view secured by an influential ITV documentary The Price of a Record.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3110362928?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Pw2xowFWVtcs8hK81OY6JU9oDuA%3D",""

The leading cause, loss of control in flight (NTSB, 2015b & 2015c) due to pilot inability to recognize approach to stall/spin conditions (NTSB, 2015b & 2016b). In 2013, there were 1,224 GA accidents in the U.S., accounting for 94% of all U.S. aviation accidents and 90% of all U.S. aviation fatalities that year (NTSB, 2015c). Aviation entails multiple challenges for pilots related to task management, procedural errors, perceptual distortions, and cognitive discrepancies. While machine errors in airplanes have continued to decrease over the years, human error still has not (NTSB, 2013).A preliminary analysis of a PC-based, Garmin G1000 flight deck was conducted with 3 professional pilots. Analyses revealed increased task load, opportunities for distraction, confusing perceptual ques, and hindered cognitive performance. Complex usage problems were deeply ingrained in the functionality of the system, forcing pilots to use fallible work arounds, add unnecessary steps, and memorize knob turns or button pushes.Modern computing now has the potential to free GA cockpit designs from knobs, soft keys, or limited display options. Dynamic digital displays might include changes in instrumentation or menu structuring depending on the phase of flight. Airspeed indicators could increase in size to become more salient during landing, simultaneously highlighting pitch angle on Attitude Indicators and automatically decluttering unnecessary information for landing. Likewise, Angle-of-Attack indicators demonstrate a great safety and performance advantage for pilots (Duquette & Dorr, 2014; NTSB, 2015b & 2016b), an instrument typically found in military platforms and now the Icon A5, light-sport aircraft (Icon, 2016).How does the design of pilots’ environment—the cockpit—further influence their efficiency and effectiveness? To explore the possibilities for small aircraft displays, a participatory design investigation was conducted with 9 qualified instrument pilots. Aviators designed mock cockpits on a PC using pictorial cutouts of analog (e.g., mechanical dials) and digital (e.g., dynamic displays) controls. Data was analyzed qualitatively and compared to similar work. Finally, a template for GA displays was developed based on pilot input.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1793940958?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2F%2FcOguBHK4GRcWfqdJrRjOafEFs%3D",""
"International Aviation Terrorism: The Lockerbie Affair Between Law and Politics","","Brizi, Maria Rosaria","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2006-01-01","2006","","","","","","9798302360281","ENG","On 21 December 1988 a civil airliner, Pan Am 103, blew apart over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland. This was a major terrorist attack against civil aviation, which shocked billions of people and gained worldwide media attention. This thesis examines the Lockerbie case in its political and legal dimension as a heinous and spectacular example of international aviation terrorism. First, it discusses the very idea of terrorism and the inherent definitional problems. Then, it focuses on the disaster and its aftermath. The thesis approaches the numerous issues this complex case raised as years went by. In particular, it portrays the long-standing diplomatic and political wrangle between the United Kingdom and the United States on one side and Libya on the other side.The International Court of Justice and the United Nations Security Council were both involved in this case. The thesis tries to depict the inextricable link between law and politics within the United Nations framework and the difficult balance the judicial and the political powers need striking for a correct and fruitful functioning of the whole system. The Lockerbie case turned out to be a testing-gown for the inherent consistency of the United Nations set-up. Extradition of the alleged perpetrators of the bombing was the issue at stake. For the first time ever, the Security Council imposed sanctions on a sovereign state in order to secure to justice the alleged perpetrators of a terrorist attack. And this raised another pivotal issue that this thesis explores: the adequacy of sanctions as a means for inducing a country’s leadership to adopt a certain course of action.The Lockerbie case is also a story of unofficial diplomacy where mediation of enlightened leaders such as Nelson Mandela proved pivotal. The stance that so-called emerging powers took was also crucial to determine the course of the following events. Ultimately, a criminal trial took place and somebody was convicted for the heinous onslaught. This thesis tries to analyse the Lockerbie trial in its peculiarity: for the first time ever, a national Court sat in a foreign country in order to deal with a criminal case. If the parties to the dispute had not compromised on the idea of a neutral venue where to stage the trial, the latter would have probably never come about.Yet, the criminal trial was not the closing chapter of the lengthy Lockerbie saga. Of course, for the grieving families of the victims, the fact that somebody was held accountable was better than nothing. Yet, the said families also tried to advocate their own cause and get something more than a criminal verdict convicting one single person. Restitution being impossible, there was still room for monetary compensation. This thesis focuses on the lengthy and painful battle the families of the Lockerbie victims engaged in. It was a double battle, actually: one against the airline that had somehow let one of its aircraft crash and one against the Libyan Government, which might be held responsible for the deeds of its agents. None of the two was an easy battle to win and yet it was pivotal to fight both, if justice was to be achieved.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3161877904?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=vyAb69emLztnXLNpGdW6nU9AU9M%3D",""

This study principally assessed the contribution of quality management on the employee’s performance in the public sector. The study had focused on three indicators which are the top management strategies, human resource management practices and process management. The research adopted a cross sectional study design where a specific focus was at Tanzania Revenue Authority, Dar es Salaam where interview and questionnaires were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative data respectively. The study adopted two sampling approaches, where simple random sampling was employed in selecting respondents for filling of questionnaires while purposive sampling technique was used to select respondents for interviews. The quantitative data was analysed through descriptive statistics and the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable was established using multiple regressions analysis technique. The study findings revealed that, all the three independent variables top management strategies, human resource management practices and process management had a significant positive relationship with the dependent variable (employees` performance). Therefore, the three variables of quality management are significant predictors of employees` performance. The study recommends that, when practicing quality management, organizations and business should focus on having strategies which enhances quality of services and businesses, and therefore enhancing the performance of employees. Also, all practices regarding making a conducive environment for employees should be highly focused. Employees should be properly rewarded and given the best working environment to be able to fulfil company`s objectives. Apart from that, organizations should practice process management in their organization for their continued survival.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3224574406?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=coft92QAolqcZapcVKDqmTcHHU0%3D",""

However, its usefulness to the examination of the information-processing and decision-making processes can be extended to other occupational fields. This study extends the work of previous authors by conducting research on individual SA differences in workers in a high-intensity job outside of the aviation field. An assessment center metric that is based upon a thorough job analysis is presented as an objective measure of SA outside of a simulator. The measure demonstrated acceptable content and discriminate validity as well as acceptable reliability. A model of individual differences in the three levels of SA of workers in high-intensity jobs was shown to account for significant variance in the three levels of SA. Individual difference variables of experience, cognitive ability, and perceptual speed and accuracy explained 41 percent of the variance in the first level of SA (perception). The equations explaining significant amounts of variance in the second and third levels of SA (comprehension and projection) were based upon the preceding SA level and not on the measures of the individual cognitive abilities investigated, demonstrating the sequential nature of SA. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of SA research to favorably impact business. The use of SA as a measure of effectiveness for information technology systems could provide insight into the design of software. It may well give a good indication of whether the system is just providing perceptual information that must be fused and filtered by the human operator or whether it provides information that is packaged such that understanding and decisions are natural conclusions following the presentation of the information. Incorporating the concept of SA into the human resource process might also be fruitful. Applying SA to the selection of people for jobs has the potential to ensure that workers in high-intensity jobs are capable of obtaining high levels of SA under high information and high workload conditions. The application of knowledge learned from the investigation of SA to training programs may also be fruitful if people can be trained in certain aspects of SA.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304687531?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ZbJahfNjHUOfdYEQPaRKadR7tyI%3D",""

One view is that humans are a problem to control. Humans were seen as the cause of safety trouble. These negative characteristics could be identified by testing and screening employees. Technological developments were so rapid and complex that no amount of intervention addressing the human worker alone could solve safety problems. Hence, the question is whether the solution lies in greater bureaucratization, and in seeing people as a problem to control. Continuing to see people as a problem to control through protocol and compliance may deliver more of the same, and not much progress. The most useful prescription is to strike a balance between bureaucratically controlled safety and worker-managed safety (Amalberti, 2013), or between deference to protocol and procedure on the one hand, and practical expertise on the other (Galison, 2000).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1554544756?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=A4J9K3sOnN7rfpivhRG8lnfnpck%3D",""

In this thesis, the effects of expertise, working memory capacity, inhibition and divided attention on situation awareness (SA) in simulated flight task environments are investigated. The cognitive aspects underlying the process of situation awareness are explored by analyzing the compound effects of above listed factors. Online and Offline SA measurements obtained from a simulated flight task are used with flight hours standing for expertise and scores of Automated Operation Span Task, Stroop and Coşkunöz visual attention tasks as measurements for working memory capacity, inhibition and divided attention respectively. Regression analyses reveal that expected relationships of simulator pilots’ SA with expertise and inhibition capacity are supported. On the other hand, expected relationships of SA with working memory and divided attention capacities are not revealed. This situation probably results from unsystematic differences in simulator pilots’ practices.In addition to the main experiment, simulator pilots’ levels of neural activity at their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are also measured during their behavioral performance. The relationships among neural correlates of mental workload induced by the simulated flight are investigated by the functional near-infrared (fNIR) spectroscopy optical brain imaging technology. Theorized mental workload distinction in the scenario of the simulated flight task is successfully observed in both perceived workload declarations and oxygenation measurements by fNIR.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3122717827?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=t%2FolsgccOiSmkO%2FpRtNlluSwO1w%3D",""

A qualitative interpretive research design was followed. The research question was: What are the mental models of key stakeholders in the aviation safety environment and how does this need to be accounted for in the development of an aviation safety strategy, in a Southern African context?In order to obtain a broad spectrum of the social constructs of key stakeholders with regard to aviation safety and to enhance the trustworthiness of the information, three research interventions or information gathering processes were applied. These were the individual interviews through Kelly’s Repertory Grid (Rep Grid) technique, outcomes analysis of the job of a safety manager through a focus group process and a scenario development process (in this sequence). Data was then considered in relation to certain theoretical perspectives, as well as realities in the aviation safety environment in Southern Africa.The study identified pertinent gaps between the mental models elicited from research participants during individual interventions and those elicited during group interventions, as well as a disparity between their mental models and the demands of the aviation safety environment in Southern Africa and the international community. The participants’ individual mental models (or theories in use) focused more on micro systems and symptoms of “unsafely” than the broader systemic relationships and problems. Tendencies towards silo-thinking and single loop learning were indicated.In contrast with the individual mental models, the collective or shared mental models of the participants, elicited during group interventions, represented a more systemic view and a more effective or desired model with regard to aviation safety. The broader system together with its interrelated elements, entropy and unpredictability, as well as critical elements that need to be accounted for in an aviation strategy, were identified. These were, among others, effective coordinated regulation and safety oversight on national and regional level; risk management; international recognition; legitimacy; authorization and market access for airlines; maintenance of standards; international cooperation; and training. It also became clear that safety cannot be understood and managed by focusing on Newtonian laws without a proper appreciation of human factors. Other important perspectives that were identified are the need for the establishment of a study-field for aviation psychology and effective human factors training; as well as the need for a regional regulatory function in Southern Africa.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2548876463?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=VIPcI3HeArV8i%2BZAGk7Ch2ihxyU%3D",""

This thesis focuses on providing 2D and 3D simulation frameworks using a game theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts in scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. The fundamental gap in the literature is that the models of interaction between manned and unmanned vehicles are insu cient: a) they assume that pilot behavior is known a priori and b) they disregard decision making processes. The contribution of this work is to propose a modeling framework, in which, human pilot reactions are modeled using reinforcement learning and a game theoretical concept called level-k reasoning to ll this gap. The level-k reasoning concept is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. Reinforcement learning is a mathematical learning method that is rooted in human learning. In this work, a classical and an approximate reinforcement learning (Neural Fitted Q Iteration) methods are used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 2D and 3D maneuvers.

"Demystifying the Black Box-Exploring How Users Make Sense of Fully Automated Vehicles","","Johansson, Mikael","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2020-01-01","2020","","","","","","9798496570534","ENG","Vehicles are becoming increasingly automated. Already today vehicles are able to take over and assist the human driver in certain driving tasks, and the scope of technical possibilities is rapidly expanding. However, for the proliferation of AVs to occur, there are several challenges that must first be overcome. These challenges are not only structural, including regulations and technological development, but also user-related, such as the adoption of and willingness of users to use the system. Previous research has identified the importance of user understanding of Automated Vehicles (AVs), as this affects usage directly as well as indirectly by impacting acceptance. In this thesis, a design approach has been chosen that uses a product semantic framework as the basis for addressing the issue of user understanding with the aim of exploring how users make sense of the AV. The research presented is based on data from a quasi-experimental study, conducted using a seemingly fully automated (WOz) vehicle on a test course where participants’ understanding was investigated both during and after the test runs.The findings show that use of the AV gave rise to several levels of meaning, based on two different processes. The main one was an external process, where integration of the participants’ conceptual models of human drivers and AVs, artefactual signifiers, and situational signifiers in a context developed meaning. However, an internal process was also evident, where meanings themselves developed new meanings. This thesis presents a tentative model based on the findings, describing three important components: the user’s conceptual model, the signifiers, and the meanings that arise during usage of the AV. The model illustrates the complex interplay between these three components and can be used to better understand and investigate how users make sense of AVs to aid the design and development of AVs.The thesis also contributes to the field of product semantics through the practical application of product semantic theories, in addition to providing further insight into how users develop meaning and make sense of artefacts, by describing the processes and components which seem to be the foundation when making sense of artefacts.Having said that, further studies need to explore in greater detail the dynamics of the process of making sense, the process of making sense in partially automated vehicles, and how meaning changes during a prolonged usage.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2606863360?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=IBlwvKjJ0eRbpTGrN3nD6h4lWQE%3D",""
"General Variable Neighborhood Search for the Drone-Assisted Vehicle Routing Problem with Robot Stations","","Morim, André Craveiro","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2020-01-01","2020","","","","","","9798383262313","ENG","The goal of the present study is to formally define the 'Drone-Assisted Vehicle Routing Prob- lem with Robot Stations' (VRPD-RS), a problem that combines the delivery concept of trucks operating in tandem with drones and satellite stations that store robots to minimize the delivery completion time, i.e., makespan, or the operational cost. Due to the computational complexity of the problem and also to allow addressing instances of practical size and relevance, an heuristic solution approach tailored to the VRPD-RS is presented.The VRPD-RS was modelled as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and numerical exper- iments were performed using a state-of-the-art solver to understand the impact of adding trucks, drones and robot stations to a delivery system. Additionally, an algorithm based on the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) metaheuristic framework, that applies five local search operators created specifically for the problem, was developed. In order to validate the solution approach, the solutions returned by the algorithm were compared against the results achieved by the solver. Finally, the algorithm was used to solve problems marked by road network congestion to assess how drones and robots can help mitigate its impact on the makespan.The numerical results evidence that the VRPD-RS is computationally demanding as for the minimization of makespan and operational cost, the solver failed to reach optimal solutions within one hour of execution for instances with 10 and 15 customers, respectively. The results also confirm that including robot stations leads to makespan and operational cost reductions. For the makespan objective, the results show that additional trucks are more effective in reducing the delivery time than additional drones, but contribute to increased operational costs. More drones, however, beyond improving makespan, result in cost reductions. Additionally, using multiple trucks and drones did not impact the operational cost obtained using one truck and one drone, but allowed to reduce the corresponding makespan. The proposed GVNS heuristic yielded an average gap of -2.8% to solver solutions within an average of 9 minutes for the makespan objective. In terms of cost minimization, an average gap of 2.5% was achieved for approximately 5 minutes of running time, on average. The analysis of congested scenarios confirmed that, compared to truck- only systems, not only do drones and robots help improve the makespan and associated operational cost but also increase system robustness against makespan increases caused by congestion.This dissertation contributes to the scientific literature concerned with studying the impact of including autonomous vehicles in distribution systems. The computational experiments prove that a delivery concept supported by trucks, drones and robots has a positive impact in terms of minimal delivery time and operational cost. Moreover, an efficient solution approach capa- ble of improving minimum makespan VRPD-RS solutions found by a state-of-the-art solver and reaching near-optimal minimum operational cost VRPD-RS solutions is presented. The GVNS metaheuristic has the potential to be applied in subsequent studies to further demonstrate the use- fulness of the concept modelled by the VRPD-RS, e.g., inclusion of time-windows or optimization of a combined cost-makespan objective.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3085953732?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=QEtWjjCh2%2F%2F5PGgDQt%2F%2FrwhOWLM%3D",""

The general aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between SA and individual cognitive di erences. Specifically, the predictive value of working memory and attentional capacity measures on SA measures, taken from pilots of different expertise levels, is of interest. In the literature, SA has mostly been studied from an applied perspective. The present study therefore aims at providing the necessary cognitive underpinnings of these more applied studies.Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, individual di erences and SA measures have been taken from thirty-six pilots. Automated Operation Span, Stroop Task, and Choice Reaction Time Task with Dichotic Listening were used for measuring working memory capacity (WMC), inhibition, and divided attention, respectively. Online and offline SA measurements were employed together for tapping on different aspects of SA in a cognitively demanding flight scenario. Results showed that WMC and expertise explain 58% of variability in offline scores while inhibition, divided attention, and expertise explain 52% of variability in online scores. In Experiment 2, the aim was to find correlates of eye movements in terms of individual differences. Scan patterns were studied across four SA-related visual tasks with ten expert pilots. Results showed that more expert pilots produced less fixation durations but no other e ects of individual di erences on the eye movements were observed.

Safety cultures should be assessed in order to improve an organization’s state of safety (Adjekum et al., 2015; Cooper, Collins, Bernard, Schwann, & Knox, 2019; Wiegmann, Zhang, von Thaden, Sharma, & Gibbons, 2004). Questionnaires are one of the best ways of obtaining information about an organization’s safety culture (Wiegmann et al., 2004; Wald, Gray, & Eatough, 2018). Additionally, the extent to which aviation hazards are reported (hazreps) serve as an indicator of the health of an aviation Safety Management System (SMS) (Adjekum et al., 2015; Cooper et al., 2019) and as a marker of a proactive safety culture (Gu & Itoh, 2013; Reason, 2008; Reiman & Pietikäinen, 2012). Proactive safety cultures are linked to hazard mitigation amongst aviation organizations (Barach, 2000; Reiman & Pietikäinen, 2012). In light of this, and in an effort to have a proactive safety culture, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) wishes to know the extent of the relationship between its annual Operational Climate Survey (safety survey) and hazreps. The main research question for this thesis is: What is the extent of the relationship between USCG aviation safety survey data and the total of aviation hazards reported? First, an Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted to determine the validity and reliability of the safety survey using data from FY 2015 to FY 2018 (n = 10,622) and to reduce the survey data to clusters of items within factors. The survey was found to be statistically reliable. The averaged survey items within factors represented the survey in order to perform a Pearson’s Correlation procedure between the survey data and hazrep totals per USCG air station (n = 28) per year. In addition, multiple regression procedures were carried out to determine if the safety survey was predictive of the extent to which hazards were reported. This research revealed that there was no statistically significant correlation between the safety survey and hazreps, and consequently, the safety survey was not predictive of hazreps.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2275956130?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=21VCgComB%2Bb0r5Lmsen3TIijqxM%3D",""

Gender issues relating to male and female attitudes and beliefs have influenced historically male and female interactions. Males and females must interact in flight, and gender stereotypes negatively could influence crew interactions. Aviation leaders introduced the concept of crew resource management to address pilot skills and reactions in flight. The present study used the phenomenological qualitative study to explore the experiences of pilots on mixed gender crews. The researcher conducted 12 interviews with commercial pilots, focusing on individual experiences of flying in a mixed crew. The results of the study produced five major themes including aviator attitudes, crew communication, differential treatment between genders, gender differences, and the belief there were no issues in mixed gender crews. The themes revealed differences between males and females have a direct impact on crew resource management while flying.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1562523603?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=wY2X1JPhGR8HCM8ZGxvoS80cS5g%3D",""
"High-fidelity weather simulation for improved flight training and investigation of pilots' weather-related decisions","","Johnson, Christopher Matthew","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2012-01-01","2012","","","","","","978-1-267-42585-0","ENG","The mortality rate for accidents involving visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is disproportionately high. ""Over the past ten years, 86% of VFR-into-IMC accidents have been fatal, causing 518 individual deaths"" (AOPA, 2010, p. 18). This creates significant uncertainty about why these accidents happen. Therefore, to better understand the root causes of VFR flight into IMC, the present project explores the current state of the art of flight training.   Accident data show that VFR flight into IMC is partially due to training and experience deficiencies and partially due to misplaced motivation on behalf of pilots (Burian, Orasanu & Hitt, 2000; Goh & Wiegmann, 2002; O'Hare & Owen, 2002). However, laboratory-derived findings of VFR flight into IMC have failed to support prominent psychological theories of decision making (Wiegmann, Goh & O'Hare, 2002). Results of a fine-grained analysis of previous simulation research revealed that this disparity across data sources is primarily due to the fact that current weather simulation is inadequate for training and investigating pilots' weather-related decision skills. Since it would be unsafe to send pilots into actual inclement weather to gain this expertise, high-fidelity weather simulation was developed as a proof of concept to examine this issue. An experiment was conducted in which 16 VFR-only pilots and 16 instrument-rated pilots flew a simulated cross-country flight in marginal VFR weather that encountered IMC. Their procedural performance and demographic variables were analyzed to identify key flight skills and experience-related factors associated with good weather-related decision making.  IMC experience was found to be the only significant demographic factor that promoted proper communication skills such as analyzing in-flight weather reports to support good weather-related decisions during the simulated flight experiment. Total previous flight time and IFR-rating were not significant factors. These findings speak to the high fidelity of the weather simulation utilized in this experiment, and they shed light on the inadequacies of flight training discussed herein that restrict pilots from accessing challenging weather scenarios during training. Results from this study provide empirical support for the deployment of high-fidelity weather simulation for advanced training and investigation of pilots' weather-related decisions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1027130769?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=FiZkYI8uvDVH6THr9%2BIKD1FLeLw%3D",""

Scan paths and three eye-tracking metrics (Fixation Frequency, Gaze Duration Mean, and Gaze Percentage) were used to investigate the differences in eye behavior of three expert control room operators and six novice students as they monitored and corrected a Crude Refinement simulation.A 2x2x2 mixed factor design was used to explore the effects that expertise (expert and novice), interface type (black and grey), and alarm activity (active and inactive) had on participant eye behavior specifically, fixation frequency, gaze duration mean, and gaze percentage for certain areas of interest. The display was separated into 6 different areas and each area resulted in distinct eye statistics. Scan paths were plotted surrounding a subtle setpoint change within the simulation and were qualitatively analyzed to reveal differences due to expertise, interface type and alarm activity.The MANOVA revealed no significant differences due to expertise, interface type, and alarm activity. The single ANOVAs revealed that participants had higher fixation frequencies on the Main display during monitoring periods than during active periods revealing that both expert and novice participants’ attention was more divided when there were failures and alarms present than when the process was running at normal conditions. Also, experts spent a larger percentage of time monitoring the critical crude temperature and flow controller than novices. Pearson’s correlation between dependent variables revealed a positive correlation between fixation frequency and gaze percentage that indicated that participants typically had many, quick fixations rather than few, long fixations.

These negative effects of  fatigue cause performance decrement by an aircrew and thus increase the threat to air  safety. Primary factor in the course of fatigue, the ‘Sleep’ needs to addressed.  Pharmacological interventions are effective in achieving good sleep both in quality  and quantity. Zolpidem, a non benzodiazepine hypnotic has beneficial effects on sleep  initiation and maintenance. The study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of  Zolpidem 5 mg and 10 mg in maintaining mental alertness after Zolpidem induced  daytime sleep. Also it is evaluated to know whether sleep inertia sets in after waking  from Zolpidem induced daytime sleep.Methodology:20 healthy male volunteers participated in the study. A double  blind, placebo controlled study was designed. Participants were evaluated on three  occasions, successive sessions separated by a minimum period of 48 hrs. Each  evaluation was started at 0800 h with participants reporting to sleep lab at IAM.  Subjective feeling of sleepiness and fatigue, sleep quality in the previous night were  assessed through questionnaires. Objective assessment of alertness and performance  was assessed through Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) monitor. At 1200 h drug  intervention Placebo/Zolpidem 5 mg/ Zolpidem 10 mg was carried out after  subjective and objective assessment. There after participants were made to sleep in  sleep lab. From 1800 to 2400 h the subjective and objective assessments were  conducted every hourly.Results: The participants in the study perceived no difference in the sleep  quality induced by Zolpidem in daytime with previous night sleep quality (GSQS: Placebo: 0800h – 1.35 ± 1.03 & 1800h – 2.95 ± 2.41 p=0.013; 5 mg Zolpidem:  0800h – 1.50 ± 1.27 & 1800h – 1.75 ± 1.33 p=0.564; 10 mg Zolpidem: 0800 h – 1.60  ± 1.35 & 1800 h: 1.75 ± 1.65 p=0.366). The Zolpidem induced sleep in all  participants at the time participants were feeling very active (KSS). The SSS  exhibited significant increase with increase in time from wakefulness with placebo  and Zolpidem 5mg and 10 mg group. However with 5mg Zolpidem the alertness was  maintained after waking from sleep whereas with 10mg Zolpidem subjects perceived  sleepiness at 1800h and thereafter their alertness was maintained. Lapses in PVT  exhibited significant increase in number of lapses with increase in time of  wakefulness in placebo group (p=0.033). However, there was no significant effect  with increase in time of wakefulness with Zolpidem 5 mg (p=0.882) and Zolpidem 10  mg (p=0.089). The other parameters of PVT (Mean RT, Mean RRT, Mean 10% FRT,  Mean 10% SRT) exhibited no significant effect between time of wakefulness and  drug intervention.Conclusion:In this study the Zolpidem initiated the sleep at time not favourable  to sleep effectively with no decrement in mental alertness and performance  subsequent to arousal after Zolpidem induced daytime sleep. 5 mg Zolpidem found to  effective in maintaining alertness in post awake period compared to 10 mg Zolpidem. It is thus concluded from the study that Zolpidem is effective as ‘No-Go Pill’ and can  be utilised in aviation scenario to optimise the aircrew performance in situations  involving circadian disruptions and sustained/continuous operations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2866084448?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=UEpWGrmXxyOyQ7uhtvPwHnUur%2Fk%3D",""

Aircraft inspection is mostly visual in nature. Thus it has led to the development of computer simulators to train human inspectors performing the inspection task. However, the lack of immersion and interaction in such simulators has led to limited effectiveness and adoption. Using advances in graphics and virtual reality technology, there is an increase the sense of involvement in using these simulators. Though technology is available to provide higher levels of immersion, it is expensive. It is not very clear if the higher fidelity in virtual reality simulators translate to an increase in the effectiveness of training. This research explores the effect of fidelity on presence, perception and performance applied to the development of virtual reality aircraft inspection simulators. Initially, training simulators are developed at varying levels of fidelity using an iterative process evaluating different interfaces. A transfer effects study evaluating the effectiveness of the VR training provided at varying levels of fidelity is conducted. This research compares the performance of VR trained novice inspectors in an actual aircraft inspection task to the performance of novice inspectors receiving traditional classroom training. Eight different implementations of the training simulators derived by combining two levels of graphic realism with four levels of display interfaces are then evaluated on task performance measures, situation awareness and subjective measures of presence and workload.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304676193?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=aRh%2B3CnIa%2BdTCP7056a9PYGmCpA%3D",""

The survey was given to aviation students at Arizona State University (ASU) Polytechnic Campus. ASU student pilots were found to be fatigued through a single sample t-test. Other t-tests were done on each of the questions that asked student pilots how flight training, school work, work outside of school and social obligations affect their sleep loss. Flight training and school were found to be contributing to student pilots sleep loss. Work outside of school and social obligations were found to not be contributing to student pilots sleep loss.

There is a shift from a cognitive perspective to an affective one, which concerns promoting pleasure instead of just preventing design deficiencies. There has been a growing interest in affect and pleasure in such areas as engineering design, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, and industrial design. Human Factors/Ergonomics (HF/E) approaches in aviation generally focus on the system’s functional features like human performance, human error, workload, and situation awareness, without considering the emotional interactions.This thesis aims to contribute to the aviation area in terms of affective design by determining the affective dimensions of a flight deck design, proposing an evaluation scale for measuring the perceived affective qualities in a flight deck design. For this purpose, two different studies were conducted within the scope of this thesis. In the first study, interviews were conducted with the pilots by using the Repertory Grid Technique and Laddering Technique conjointly to elucidate how pilots evaluate a cockpit design. The findings led to developing a model for affective qualities in flight deck design.The second study aimed to design and verify a scale that measures the affective qualities in flight deck design. For this purpose, based on the previously designed model in the first study and with the items generated there, FlightDeck Affectiveness Rating Scale (F-ARS) was developed and conducted with the pilots. The scale consists of nine dimensions, namely, Pleasure, Comfort, Feeling in Control, Embodiment, Feeling of Being Supported, Sense of Familiarity, Feeling of Being in an Airvehicle, Appreciation of Design/er, and Feeling Safe.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3122678107?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=uiV0aTzrhAoVida5y6E5Sk%2FI7os%3D",""

The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to investigate the barriers women and ethnic minorities have faced when entering aviation careers to develop initiatives that can be used to increase both gender and ethnic diversity in aviation. This research explored the barriers women and minority pilots face when entering aviation to identify and develop initiatives aviation organizations can use to diversify the industry. This qualitative phenomenological research study examined women’s and minority pilots’ experiences through the lens of sociocultural theory and in-depth interviews. This study explored sexual harassment, racism, bias, discrimination, and microaggressions to develop recommendations for aviation organizations to implement diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and create a welcoming industry for all prospective pilots. This study provided an extensive review of the historical role women and minorities have played in aviation and the contributions women and minority pilots have added to the industry. Further, this research explored the historical discrimination and bias women and minority pilots have faced since the inception of the aviation industry. Women and minorities have historically been underrepresented in aviation as the industry is approximately 93% White males. This places women and minority pilots at a disadvantage, both in the industry and in playing a role in diversifying aviation.  The participants in this research provided a glimpse into the challenges they have faced in their careers. Under the sociocultural theory, children often pursue careers they are exposed to at an early age. Girls and minorities often lose interest in pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, including aviation, by age 12. The zone of proximal development suggests that they do not have role models in the field. Several participants interviewed stated that they may not have considered an aviation career had they not been exposed at a young age. Additional barriers noted in this study included the often-prohibitive cost of training to the level at which pilots become employable at airlines or charter positions and the lack of funding opportunities available. This study provided recommendations for reducing sexual or racial harassment, increasing visibility to young girls and minorities, and funding sources. It is hoped that this research will help shed light on the challenges women and minorities in aviation face and will aid in developing initiatives that the aviation industry can employ to diversify the career field.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2895093996?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=9B%2BwpP8vBlJgPk4ipGaODXX9Woc%3D",""

Many teams are interdependent with other teams. This requires that individuals engage in a specific form of multitasking to contribute to both their team and to other interdependent teams. This thesis extends research on task switching to examine the switch costs that accrue when individuals switch between tasks that vary in their interdependence. This study examined the degree to which having mental models that are more similar to ones teammates reduces the switch cost associated with moving between more and less interdependent work. This idea was tested in a laboratory experiment including 52 college students assigned to work in one of 19 teams. Each team was paired with another team to complete both “team” and “mutliteam” decision-making tasks. Mental models were measured using pairwise comparisons, and switch costs were calculated using the time it took to switch tasks. Findings reveal the more similar an individuals’ mental model to their teammates, the quicker the individual is able to switch between tasks with different levels of interdependence (team to multiteam or multiteam to team). No difference was found in the switch cost associated with transitioning up in interdependence (team to multiteam) or down in interdependence (multiteam to team). These findings have implications for how individuals are able to manage working in teams embedded in complex systems, and how team level cognitive processes facilitate task switching in those contexts.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3275478071?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=mAl21UcMdJbznsitAsHfSIHYETE%3D",""

Eighty-three CEOs who worked in organizations located throughout the United States were contacted to participate in the study. Twenty-eight, 34%, CEOs from the eighty-three organizations contacted were interviewed. Data was collected through a four-question structured open-ended telephone interview. Data was tape recorded and transcribed for analysis through qualitative software.The researcher constructed themes identified in the study after a comprehensive literature review on competency modeling within the field of human resources. Thematic analysis and frequency counts were used to organize the study findings. Themes identified in each question were grouped into clusters from which the study proposed final assertions. From data collected in responses to the four interview questions asked to each CEO the study's assertions were as follows: (1) Business challenges CEOs were most concerned with were equally balanced between people focused challenges and financial performance challenges. (2) CEOs were closely connected and concerned with their company's workplace learning programs. CEOs perceive workplace learning programs to address business challenges through increasing employee awareness of the company's current business challenges and by designing program content that is directly related to company specific conditions and issues. (3) CEOs generally perceive an active workplace learning environment to be an asset in recruiting and retaining employees. (4) CEOs perceive the most important abilities of people responsible for workplace learning and performance programs to be Process Oriented and Application Oriented competencies. Core competencies within these competency clusters were the abilities to demonstrate business knowledge and to effectively communicate throughout the organization.Further study is needed on cross-industry comparisons of CEO perspectives on WLP. Within the study's reporting-analysis process the researcher examined perceptions of CEOs in manufacturing industries to CEOs perceptions in service industries and did not recognize any difference in perceptions on WLP.

While many studies have investigated the extent to which self-concepts (e.g., self-esteem) and perceptions of performance (e.g., self-evaluation and attributions) affect self-efficacy, they have not examined how perceptions of the training (e.g., instrumentality) affect self-efficacy for post-training performance.Specifically, this study proposed and tested hypotheses regarding the development of self-efficacy for actual task performance based on training performance and cognitive evaluation of training performance. Training performance, prior flight experience, and self-esteem predicted self-efficacy for post-training flight performance. Prior flight experience moderated the relationships between training performance and self-efficacy, and between self-esteem and self-efficacy. Implications of these findings for theories of self-regulation and for the design of training programs are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304443892?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2FP%2FK%2Ff5YGIwXfxkYzNA4V2PjCA0%3D",""
"Effects of cockpit display of traffic information on visual attention and eye movements in the general aviation cockpit","","Duley, Jacqueline Anne","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2001-01-01","2001","","","","","","978-0-493-13516-8","ENG","A General Aviation pilot must perform primary flight tasks of aviate, navigate, and communicate while attending to information regarding collision avoidance. A cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) has been previously proposed as a form of automation to assist in the latter task. The present study assessed the impact of a CDTI on the performance of a pilot's primary flight tasks. The Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MAT) was used as the primary task. The University students' multi-task performance, and visual sampling strategies with and without the CDTI were assessed. The addition of the CDTI task to the MAT task performance induced a scanning strategy change resulting in improved task performance. There appears to have been a shift from a data acquisition strategy to one emphasizing the frequent sampling of all task displays. However the engine thrust maintenance sub-task was negatively impacted by the addition of the CDTI task. It appears that the overall task demands of the MAT and CDTI together created interference with the memory demands of this sub-task leading to longer periods of time away from the optimal thrust. The effect of expertise on these abilities and strategies were investigated in a second experiment with University students and GA pilots. Expertise played a role in their strategies such that the students who had more MAT experience determined their attention strategy based on the ratio of intruders to total number of CDTI events. In contrast, the number of CDTI events appears to have driven the sampling strategies of the other participants (pilots and a second group of students) who had less experience with the MAT. The results of both experiments indicate the need for the training of an efficient information acquisition strategy particularly when a new display is added to a set of primary task displays. While the CDTI did not negatively affect overall primary task performance, it did alter the attentional strategies of the participants which was beneficial under the data-limited conditions of the first experiment but detrimental under the increased CDTI event rate of the second experiment.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/251647005?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=QgzTFqIXhqUFlqyQsPotXrDO8aY%3D",""

Investor sentiment is measured in terms of jumping rates of investors’ attitudes to the stock market in our model. The role and impact of investor sentiment on the average stock market price level are further clarified across various scenarios through simulations.FindingsOur model provides a direct quantification of the influence of investor sentiment on stock market price dynamics, shedding light on an alternative mechanism contributing to stock market crashes alongside fundamental changes. Our simulation results confirm that optimistic investor sentiment can mitigate the magnitude of negative stock market price movements triggered by adverse fundamental changes. Our model also indicates that the stock market price level may exhibit higher volatility than can be attributed to fundamental changes.Research limitations/implicationsOur study only briefly touches on the origins of shifts in investor sentiment by introducing a self-fulfilling feedback loop from the average stock market price level to investor sentiment. In future research, we will identify other key factors contributing to shifts in investor sentiment and subsequently analyze their influence on investor sentiment.Practical implicationsOur findings carry practical implications for recent and future movements in the US stock market. For instance, despite the Federal Reserve’s continuous interest rate hikes since March 2022, the overall optimistic investor sentiment has helped mitigate a severe downward movement in the stock market. However, in the absence of clear indications of a loose monetary policy, a rapid shift of investor sentiment from optimism to pessimism in the US stock market could potentially lead to a historic stock market crash.Originality/valueWhile the significance of investor sentiment in shaping stock market price dynamics, particularly regarding cross-sectional variations of stock returns, is widely recognized, quantifying directly its impact on the average stock market price level has remained a persistent challenge. Only very limited literature has delved into this subject, often hindered by a lack of theoretical support or yielding inconsistent results.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3177166631?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=4rENuqTlnTFTxDhvqRGar1Sb2%2FQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/RBF-11-2023-0299"

The purpose of the qualitative phenomenological study was to identify perceptions of leadership skills considered necessary for the role of an airline captain in North America. The study attempts to clarify the nature of airline captain leadership behaviors in order to inform the development of captain upgrade training by answering the research questions: (a) What leadership skills are necessary for becoming a captain of the airplane? and (b) How do North American airlines train leadership skills before upgrading to the captain’s position? A qualitative phenomenological design was used to gather experiences from captains from five North American passenger airlines through telephone interviews. Structured protocols were followed and captains’ responses were analyzed in order to develop themes capturing the leadership role on the flight deck from the perspective of the captain. Five emergent leadership themes were: (a) communication, (b) teamwork, (c) knowledge, (d) self-awareness, and (e) leader as mentor. Responses to the second research question suggested leadership training is lacking in depth and should be scenario-based, focused on actual situations, integrate leadership in all aspects and at times involve all flight crewmembers. Recommendations to the airlines include better structuring of leadership objectives with emphasis on depth of topic and relevance to actual job roles, integrating leadership training into all aspects of aircraft training especially during scenario-based training sessions, and including more training in overall organization and commercial issues for the aircraft captains.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/759241895?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=r72EVHQxrBRMO9tAp%2F1pJuiDxVQ%3D",""
"State-Based Analysis of General Aviation Loss of Control Accidents Using Historical Data and Pilots’ Perspectives","","Majumdar, Neelakshi","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2023-01-01","2023","","","","","","9798379435424","ENG","General Aviation (GA) encompasses all aircraft operations, excluding scheduled, military, and commercial operations. GA accidents comprise approximately 94% of all aviation accidents in the United States annually. 75% of these accidents involve pilot-related factors (pilot actions or conditions). Inflight loss of control means that the flight crew was unable to maintain control of the aircraft in flight. With almost 50% of loss of control accidents being fatal yearly, it continues to be the deadliest cause of GA accidents.The most common approach to understanding accident causation is analyzing historical data from sources such as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database. The NTSB database has abundant rich information. In contrast to the extensive investigations into and detailed reports on commercial aviation accidents, GA accident investigations tend to be shorter, and the resulting reports tend to be brief and limited—especially regarding human factors’ role in accidents. Only relying on historical data cannot provide a complete understanding of accident causation.There is a clear need to better understand the role of human factors involved in GA accidents to prevent such accidents and thus improve aviation safety. In my research, I focus on a specific type of accidents, inflight loss of control (LOC-I), the deadliest cause of GA accidents. I use historical data analysis and human-subjects research with pilots to investigate the role of human factors in loss of control accidents. Building on previous work, I created a state-based modeling framework that maximizes data extraction and insight formation from the NTSB accident reports by (1) developing a structured modeling language to represent accident causation in the form of states and triggers; (2) populating the language lexicon of states and triggers using insights from accident reports and pilots perspectives via surveys and interviews; and (3) applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automatically translate accident narratives into the language lexicon. The framework is focused on LOC-I but can be extended to other types of accidents. Findings from my study may help in consistent accident analysis, better accident reporting, and improving training methods and operating procedures for GA pilots.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2806444500?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=STdKXu0Ppl2%2BQEP5JPgMIRFBbcI%3D",""

The detrimental effects of fatigue are well known to affect adversely both physical and physiological well being of the aviator. These negative effects of fatigue cause performance decrement of an aircrew and thus increase the threat to air safety. So, the primary factor in the line of fatigue, the ‘Sleep’, needs to addressed. Pharmacological interventions are effective in achieving good sleep both in quality and quantity. Hypnotics like Zolpidem are given for inducing sleep and maintaining post awake alertness and studies have shown that they can induce sleep in short time and maintain post awake alertness. The results of the study would help in recommending the practical usage of Zolpidem in pharmacological management of fatigue.Methodology:20 healthy male volunteers participated in the study. A double blind repeated measure study design was adopted.The participants were advised to follow the instructions explained to them so that they are not in the influence of alcohol/caffeine during the conduct of study, which could influence the outcome of study. The study protocol involved analysis of sleep pattern using EEG. A baseline EEG of the subjects was recorded prior to the day of the study to assess the normal sleep pattern. On the day of study, the participants were advised to report to their normal place of work and do only routine works not involving strenuous activities. They were advised to report to the sleep lab at 1200 h. Following drug intake, they were made to sleep in the controlled environment of sleep lab at IAM, during which continuous recording of EEG was done using the Polysomnogram.Three different sessions were carried out on each participant, each session separated by at least 72 hours gap. In the initial session, baseline EEG was recorded. In the remaining two sessions, the participants were given either Zolpidem 5 mg or Zolpidem10 mg tablet.Results:The present study examined the effects of two different doses of Zolpidem (5 & 10 mg) on sleep architecture during daytime sleep. Zolpidem, in both the dosages was found to have an impact in augmenting the Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency & NREM sleep and in decreasing the REM sleep and Sleep Latency thereby providing a good quality sleep.Conclusion:Zolpidem is found to be hypnotically active at 5 mg dosage. The dosage for use as a fatigue countermeasure may be revised from the existing recommendation (5 mg for women and 10 mg for men) to 5 mg universally after substantiating the result of the present study with further studies with larger study groups.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2866351899?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3zOwJOc6wjFV0htWt7ouVuTqKCw%3D",""
"The Next Level : Video Gaming, Cognition and Motivation in Surgical Simulator Training","","Schlickum, Marcus","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2015-01-01","2015","","","","","","9798744452773","ENG","Image guided surgery uses small incisions or existing entry ports of the body in order to decrease surgical trauma which will hopefully lead to less infections, complications and number of days needed in the hospital. It is associated with great difficulties and a steep learning curve due to several reasons such as inverted movements and 2D representation of the operating area. In order to excel in minimal invasive surgery a large amount of training is required which has spurred the rise of virtual reality (VR) surgical simulators offering a safetraining environment with the possibility of customized scenarios and quantifiable feedback. Another advantage with VR simulators is easily conducted research due to objective assessment of performance and standardized task content and scenarios. Previous research has identified visual-spatial ability, the ability to mentally rotate and manipulate objects as well as visual working memory, the ability to hold visual information during a delay and recall that information, to be important for simulator training and performance. Video gaming experience has also been identified as an important background factor. This thesis consists of work derived from four studies that all take advantage of VR simulators as a tool for investigating which individual factors are needed for performance and training of minimal invasive surgery and whether or not they can be altered. In the first study the hypothesis was that the importance of visual-spatial ability (VSA) and visual working memory (VWM) would differ with different simulator task content. 25 subjects were tested for VSA, VWM and performance in three different simulators. A multivariate analysis showed that the importance differed; one task seemed to be more visually loaded than the others. That result was followed up in study II that examined whether it was possible to actually improve simulator performance by video game training and if the transfer effect differed according to simulator and video game task content. 30 subjects were matched and randomized into training with a 2D chess game or a 3D first person shooter game for five weeks, pre and posttraining subjects were tested with two different simulators. A control group consisting of 10subjects was also tested. There was a transfer effect, surprisingly also from the 2D game. Suspicions about a general cognitive workload lead to the aim in study III that investigated whether simulator performance would predict written examinations results. 158 subjects were tested in a simulator and a written examination in basic surgery. There was a performance examination correlation in female but not male subjects, which lead to study IV that investigated the role of motivation for surgical performance. In study IV, 30 subjects were tested for motivation while training in a surgical simulator. Motivation as defined by the self determination theory correlated only in male subjects to performance when highly motivated medical students were examined. It appeared to be less important for performance than visual spatial ability. Training in surgical simulators enhanced subjects’ interest in choosing surgery as a future work field. The thesis identifies the importance of certain background factors and suggests alternate means of minimal invasive training that will meet the requirements of tomorrow´s surgeons, taking surgical training to the next level.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2563685550?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=OR4p3JjGmlSdv6%2BJItivAxj7OUE%3D",""

"Acknowledgement response and interference timing during the processing of voice and datalink ATC commands","","Risser, Matthew R.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2004-01-01","2004","","","","","","978-0-496-97729-1","ENG","In aviation, effective communication between air traffic control (ATC) and pilots is critical to pilot performance and safety. Problems and limitations of current radio communications initiated the development of datalink technology. Datalink is a text system used to send messages between ATC and pilots. Although datalink was intended to reduce errors associated with radio communication, there are new concerns related to changes in information processing demands associated with executing speech and text ATC commands. In addition, the nature of responses differs between voice and datalink systems. In a voice environment, responses are immediate. However, time delays exist with datalink. These time delays may create an opportunity for interference. Therefore, the timing of interference and the acknowledgement response on command execution performance were examined during the processing of simulated ATC commands. Verbal and central executive (CE) interference tasks were presented before or after the acknowledgement. Participants received both speech and text commands, responded by a verbal or manual acknowledgement, and set the controls in a flight simulator. Results demonstrated no differences between speech and text formats with a verbal acknowledgement. However, there was an advantage for a manual acknowledgement with longer messages. Regarding interference timing, CE as opposed to verbal interference prior to an acknowledgement had a greater negative effect on control setting performance and the magnitude of this effect was larger in the text condition. Thus, text information appears to be more susceptible to the negative effects of interference as resources begin to reach capacity. However, the differences between the sources of interference decreased with an increase in message length. Therefore, the timing and type of interference can have differential effects on resource capacity and the ability to rehearse information in memory. It was also suggested that the processing code of a task is of more importance than the response code. The findings are interpreted within the context of a working memory and resource perspective and implications are discussed with regard to the communication process in aviation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305103152?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=PMbCQKygGq%2BtpuLnSTk7SO81oy8%3D",""
"An evaluation of the relationships between safety management system initiatives, transformational safety leadership, self-efficacy, safety behavior, and safety-related events mediated by safety motivation in collegiate aviation","","Adjekum, Daniel Kwasi","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2016-01-01","2016","","","","","","978-1-369-54701-6","ENG","The study conceptualized Safety Management System (SMS) initiative, self-efficacy, and transformational safety leadership as constructs that relates to safety behavior (measured by safety compliance and safety participation) when mediated by safety motivation using a concurrent-triangulation approach. The study also evaluated the relationship between safety behavior and safety-related events.  Structural equation modeling techniques was used to derive a final measurement model that fit the empirical data and was used to test the study hypotheses. Utilizing a sample of 282 collegiate flight students and instructors from a large public university, a 46-item survey was conducted to measure respondent’s perceptions on the study variables. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 4 top-level management personnel to sample their opinions on the effectiveness of the SMS initiative. Factual safety performance data on the flight program over a six-year period was analyzed to complete a triangulation approach. The results indicate that perceptions of SMS policy implementation have direct, positive effect on safety compliance and SMS process engagement has direct, positive effect on safety participation. Self-efficacy had direct, positive effect on both safety compliance and safety participation. Safety motivation fully mediated the effect of transformational safety leadership on safety participation. Safety-related events did not fully mediate the effect between safety compliance and safety participation. There were indications that respondents were not familiar with the Emergency Response Plan. An ANOVA suggests that certified flight instructors significantly had better safety participation and safety compliance than pre-private pilots did. Senior significantly had better safety participation than juniors. A T-test of mean did not reveal any significant differences in safety participation and safety compliance between respondents with formal SMS training and those without.   A review of factual safety data suggests a positive effect on the safety reporting and safety meeting attendance among respondents due to the SMS initiative.

A theory of factors that may influence automation use is given, and four experiments are performed to test the effects of the proposed factors. Factors tested include workload, task uncertainty, automation reliability, operator trust in automation, operator self confidence, operator uncertainty about system state, and risk. The results of the first experiment demonstrate that workload does not influence automation use decisions in this context, but task uncertainty and automation reliability do. The results of the second experiment support those of the first and demonstrate, in addition, that both trust in automation and uncertainty about the automation's current state affect reliance decisions, that violation of trust by an automated system does not lead to lower reliance, and that global attitudes toward automation may affect the initial use of automation but are quickly replaced as an influence by factors that are specific to the system being used. The results of the third experiment indicate that professional airline pilots, who have extensive experience with advanced automation, rely more on automation than nonpilot student subjects, even to the point of not intervening when the automation fails. The results of the fourth experiment indicate that automation use is affected by the consequences of errors, and that airline pilots use automation less following failures when the possible consequences of errors are higher. In addition, large individual difference in automation use decisions were found. These results provide support for a large number of the influences hypothesized initially, but indicate that these influences may operate across a group rather than on individuals. Instead, individuals appear to adopt simple strategies that are influenced by a small number of the possible factors. This suggests that automation use decisions by operators in real systems may be made more rational and more systematic through training or the adoption of appropriate procedures.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304107087?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=e3bRJcB42Z6A5eFhqmFIKGX5%2FUk%3D",""

The predominant theories of multitasking emphasize the potential of using alternate information processing channels to better support multitasking, and hence prompt the exploration of novel interface characteristics that may reduce cognitive and structural interference. This dissertation uses measures of SA and MWL to evaluate the potential of input and output display characteristics found in novel technologies, such as Google Glass, Pebble Smartwatch, and Windows Surface, to support multitasking performance. Three experiments were performed to evaluate the following input and output characteristics: voice input (Experiments 1 and 3), head-up display (Experiment 1), size of display (Experiments 2 and 3), use of discrete tactile signals (Experiment 2), and use of continuously informing tactile signals (Experiment 3). Experiments 1 and 2 altered only interface characteristics associated with secondary task performance, while Experiment 1 also altered interface characteristics associated with primary task performance in the attempt to more effectively redistribute MWL.  While Experiments 1 (Texting and Driving with Google Glass) and 2 (Weather Technology Characteristics in General Aviation Cockpits) indicate the potential SA and MWL benefits of using voice input and larger displays for secondary tasks in multitasking settings, Experiment 3 (Supporting Emergency Vehicle Mobile Command Terminal Use While Driving) sheds light on the limitations of these benefits with increasing task complexity. Experiment 1 showed that combining a head-up display with voice input provided additional marginal SA and MWL benefits. Experiment 2 also suggested SA and MWL benefits when using discrete tactile signals to aid in indicating the need for secondary task attentional shifts. Experiment 3 furthered this exploration of tactile signaling by presenting continuously informing vibrations relating to the primary task, exhibiting both the potential benefits of providing continuous information and the potential drawbacks of overreliance on such displays. These findings have the potential to fundamentally change the way users interact with technology by informing the development of and policies surrounding new products using these features.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1846156515?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=0D4%2F%2FmYZm5K%2Bd%2F%2FlmzwytxTgdY8%3D",""

The Federal Aviation Administration, in partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, established the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) to provide a vehicle for personnel to self-report safety concerns. This study examined 361 ASRS cases voluntarily reported by maintainers from 2002 to 2007.

The findings identified 4 specific latent conditions, or 15% of those provided by HFACS-ME, that can affect maintenance: adverse mental state, inadequate training or preparation, inadequate communication, and inadequate assertiveness. The results showed how these four conditions make up 66% of the factors influencing error on the flight line. These results may be used for commercial aviation maintenance to increase maintainer awareness of conditions leading to maintenance error. This awareness can promote the safety refinement of specific human intervention patterns through self-realization by line maintenance personnel. Implications for positive social change include improving workforce awareness of latent conditions that could lead to improved commercial aviation safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/895975141?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=VZHAyRgbNdS3%2BXQBTD1ghaVnOII%3D",""

"A longitudinal model of social amplification of commercial aviation risks: Exploring United States news media attention to fatal accidents and media effects on air travel behavior, 1978–2001","","Romantan, Anca","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2004-01-01","2004","","","","","","978-0-496-85238-3","ENG","This dissertation addresses two questions: what determines U.S. news media coverage of fatal airplane accidents, and what is the effect of coverage and of media representations on the number of passengers who fly. It builds on theories of risk and theories of media effects integrating the concept of signal value and exploring how the news media react to a class of risks and generate processes of social amplification of risks in the population. Analyses combined content analyses of the amount and nature of Associated Press (AP) and television coverage of fatal accidents with government data about accidents and enplanements over the period from 1978 to August 2001. Findings suggest that news media attention to fatal accidents is a function of signal value components. Fatalities, carrier type, accident location, the intensity of media representations of accidents as air terrorism, and as mysterious, as well as the density of past accidents—generate coverage independently, but also in complex interactions. Fatalities is the strongest predictor of coverage. The full models accounted for 70% and 62% of the variance in AP and television news coverage, respectively. Some components—fatalities, carrier type, and representations of air terrorism—reinforce each other, generating spiraling amplification in coverage. Regarding the issue of time-concentrated reactions to risks, accidents occurring in periods dense in accidents have a higher likelihood of being selected for television coverage. However, they reduce the positive effect of fatalities and of links to air terrorism on coverage, perhaps because of disaster fatigue or competition for a limited news hole among the accidents covered. Addressing the media effects question, time-series analyses produced some evidence that air travel behavior responds inversely to the volume of media coverage. Media influence is non-linear: behavior tracks coverage inversely only after a threshold is reached and levels off at high levels of coverage. Furthermore, coverage effects are also contingent on monthly fatalities, density of accidents and media representations of accidents as the result of air terrorism. The latter interaction strengthens claims about a media effect on behavior resulting from the combined effect of volume of coverage and media representations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305144193?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=7F5jYzzStsrOh6wRFF9vLAEMJEc%3D",""
"Challenges of Aviation Security Regulation in Norwegian Post 9/11","","Olsvik, Elise Anonby","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2015-01-01","2015","","","","","","9798280744950","ENG","The 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA had wide-ranging consequences for security issues in Western societies. Within civil aviation, the attacks became grim evidence that the security system constructed to prevent intentional attacks was deficient. In Europe, the European Union took on the responsibility to gather European civil aviation security under one banner, relieving the EU members’ national legislation on aviation security, uniting it through implementing one common supranational regulation for all EU countries.As a non-EU member, Norway was obligated by the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA Agreement) to implement the same regulations as the EU countries to avoid being banned from the One-Stop Security regime that had been in effect prior to the 9/11 attacks. The bearing principle in the OneStop Security regime is that any passenger who is security screened at any entry point within the system will forego any new screenings whilst travelling within the system. Therefore, every airport participating in this system must, regardless of size, implement measures that ensure that the EU regulative level is maintained at the same predefined level. In order to achieve this, a highly prescriptive regulation was developed, based on main documents from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) that had previously been applied as guiding documents for the national civil aviation regulations and legislation. These documents had previously provided recommendations that each country was only obliged to report deviations from, but after 9/11 these became mandatory in the new EU regulation. This thesis aims at describing the consequences of this regulatory transition by investigating the following research problem: “What are the consequences of implementing EU security regulation in the Norwegian civil aviation system?”The main aim is, thus, to discover possible consequences of the regulatory system instated post 9/11, both on the authority and airport levels, connecting regulatory types to organisational challenges. In order to study these issues, a charting of the Norwegian civil aviation system and the regulatory landscape was performed by interviewing the main actors and authorities within Norwegian civil aviation. Thereafter, fieldworks were conducted at three different sized airports. In addition, to understand the findings of the Norwegian implementation, a comparative case was made by conducting interviews with key actors in the Icelandic civil aviation system. This comparison was intriguing since Iceland, like Norway, is obligated through the EEA Agreement, yet Iceland chose a different implementation than Norway. Airport security can be defined as a High Reliability Organisation (HRO), as defined by Weick et al. (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 1999, p. 90). These are organisations that operate in a highly unforgiving environment which, in case of errors, has the potential for disastrous outcomes. As security is threatened by different kinds of risks than those with which HRO theory and literature normally have been occupied, I argue that this has less importance when the purpose is to investigate which factors produce reliable outcomes in organisations, regardless of whether the threats are intentionally caused (security) or accidentally caused (safety). Thus, studies on security can be profitably incorporated into the vast literature on organisational safety and reliability. The findings from this study reveal a high degree of constraint at the airport level, both among leaders and employees, caused by the construction of the security regulation and its implementation. Possibilities for action, through influence and involvement in regulatory processes, decreased exponentially with the increase in details and prescription after 9/11. Possibilities for action, or ‘space for action’ as it has been labelled in this thesis, is what facilitates the organisation to adapt and adjust regulation into the context. Seen in relation to HRO principles, limited possibilities for action may lead to mindlessness and, thus, threaten the overall reliability in an organisation. Consequences will necessarily follow a groundbreaking event like what occurred on 9/11. Not only did the security system demonstrate its limitations, but the symbolic value was also high. Consequently, this will affect people’s perception of the trustworthiness of the system. Authoritative action will be essential, and speed will demonstrate vigour. The regulatory work inaugurated in the hours following the terrorist act on 9/11 has unquestionably heightened the security level for civil aviation. However, more than a decade later, it is possible to explore the transition in hindsight to see its consequences in the actual context of the airport. ","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3228734003?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=fl%2FQ6pJaz8w7BO1fdebjguipfoM%3D",""

Color vision is of extreme importance to pilots and in other occupations that require excellent color discrimination. Advancements in laser technology, however, have required the need for laser eye protection. Laser eye protection alters the spectral world that pilots and other professionals must work in. Understanding the effects of these alterations is necessary to prevent mishaps and further applied color vision knowledge. The present study experimentally manipulated the spectral environment and aviation tasks faced by military pilots. Several spectrally selective filters were used to modify the spectral environment. Subjects performed a wide and inclusive range of color vision and aviation tasks with the filters. The effects of these filters on color vision were modeled after current theories of color processing. The predicted results were compared with the actual results. It was found that color vision is both enhanced and decreased by spectrally selective filters, with certain filters safety is compromised when pilots are distracted, and computational modeling may offer predictive benefits in understanding filter and vision interactions. This research contributes to both applied and basic theories regarding the complex relationship between color vision, filters, and aviation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305429655?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2F4fiarvKgC0f8eOuzdxlt0DKZUM%3D",""

The intent of such displays is to assist operators in not only following operational procedures, but also in comprehending the context of the procedures, enabling them to understand why, when, and how to deviate from the procedures if necessary. The results of the dissertation research show that the addition of procedure context increases situation awareness and reduces procedure-following errors, which has been shown to be a significant causative factor for accidents in aviation and other domains. In addition, a pilot's ability to comprehend noncompliance appears to be limited, despite their interest in (and ability to) detect noncompliance. Pilots do not appear be able to interpret the consequences of that noncompliance, suggesting that the design of displays and procedures should assist them in doing so. The results also demonstrate that pilots attempted to use procedure information even when clearly outside the scope of the procedure. This means that procedures and procedure-support aids should consider operation outside of its normal bounds in their design, rather than only for nominal operation as is currently the case.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305185217?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=CLsMlFkd7oJsEBvcxwK66Ef6n5c%3D",""

As it stands, students in the aviation program are trained in academic silos creating a lack of a shared mental model between team members of different disciplines.  Without a shared mental model, students in various disciplines are unaware of other’s knowledge and abilities related to their own.  This proves problematic once on the job, where aviation students are required to work in teams consisting of members from all disciplines (Swan, Scarbrough, & Newell, 2010).  With little to no prior training in teamwork between specializations, newly hired aviation employees may lack the interpositional knowledge, and teamwork skills, and abilities to perform adequately.  In order to address this need for teamwork training in the aviation industry, a NASA funded high fidelity flight operation center unified system (FOCUS Lab) was developed to aid in developing aviation students’ teamwork skills.  The FOCUS Lab simulates the environment in an airline’s Flight Operations Center.  While studies show that participants of the FOCUS Lab like the training and are learning and improving across simulations despite the increasing difficulty level (Littlepage et al., 2013; Littlepage, Hein, Moffett, Craig, & Georgiou, 2015), there has not been a study looking to see if these skills transfer beyond the simulation.  The purpose of the FOCUS Lab is to better prepare students for the workforce; however, if the skills do not transfer, then we cannot truly verify the success of the FOCUS Lab.  The Research Question for this study was what are the effects of high fidelity simulation training on initial employment experiences?  Participants consisted of aviation graduates from a large Southeastern University.  Additionally, as a control group Industrial and Organizational Psychology graduates were contacted as well.  Seven-hundred and three participants were contacted via e-mail and asked to complete an online Qualitrics quiz.  Results from the survey suggested that those graduating from the FOCUS Lab had lower turnover intentions and demonstrated more adequate teamwork skills in interdependent work settings.

Nevertheless, landing flare accident rates are relatively high and past studies have implicated flaws in flare instruction. This study tested the effectiveness and ergonomics of an alternative landing flare method. Twenty-six participants with no prior aviation background were trained to land a Cessna 182S simulator. Control participants were provided with traditional landing flare instruction and experimental participants with a discriminative auditory cue. Results indicated that control participants flared significantly higher, registered higher impacts at touchdown, and appeared to initiate the flare in a trial-and-error fashion. Thus, applying simple behavioral concepts to flare training may facilitate proper flares and reduce landing flare accidents rates.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/276309553?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2BI7lkoOm6cahSBhv1hqbLZHTDDU%3D",""

"A mixed method approach to collegiate aviation self-assessment of G-load on landing: Pilot perception versus reality","","Hensellek, Karin Louise","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2013-01-01","2013","","","","","","978-1-303-43859-2","ENG","Because there is no universal definition of a hard landing, pilots themselves must determine if a landing was hard enough to require an unscheduled maintenance inspection. Large, transport category aircraft are equipped with flight data monitoring (FDM) as a secondary data source that can help pilots determine if a hard landing occurred, but FDM is not commonplace in general aviation. It is important for a pilot to be able to differentiate between a firm landing that does not cause damage to the aircraft and hard landing that potentially could cause damage to the aircraft by means of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive cues. Self-assessment of these cues helps pilots determine if the landing should be considered a hard landing. Self-assessments are subjective and depending upon metacognitive level, a pilot may fall prey to self-serving bias.  To determine if self-serving bias is present in the aviation domain, participants completed a survey on landing perceptions. Additionally, flight data monitoring equipment provided actual landing data. Results suggest that self-serving bias is not common in the aviation domain unlike existing literature suggests. Many participants were unable to accurately perceive landing G-load, indicating that FDM equipment provides reliable data.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1449156733?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Obv0093eti0vLZiVJGy7HqSKIRg%3D",""

The target audience was SEC A & B, 15-24 years and 25-34 years.Primary research was conducted among 10 media planners, 40 households and two channel marketers.The analysis of ratings showed that the ratings for these channels peaked during prime-time which in India is the time when TV viewing is the highest. The ratings are higher for weekends then for weekdays.The most favourable time-band for Discovery is from 8:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m. for all the target audiences studied. Ratings have shown a considerable increase across the two periods for Discovery and MTV. Ratings for Channel V have seen a considerable decline during this period. The peak ratings across music channels correspond to Hindi music programmingThe survey among the media planners showed that from a broad perspective niche channels can be defined by the genres of programming, which means there are certain kinds of programming preferred by certain segments of the audience. Thus these channels cater to a Particular need of that small segment of the audience. The role of these channels is to provide an environment, for qualitative factors that go beyond numbers and to provide additional reach within a particular reach more cost effectively as compared to popular, general entertainment channels.In-spite of all the reasons cited by the media planners, advertising on these channels still seems to be guided by the good deals offered by them and their marketing efforts.The survey conducted among the viewers showed that Discovery was emerging as a preferred channel for males both in the 15-24 years and in 25-34 years age group. The core audience for music in terms of preference of programming was the youth(15-24 years). Among the music channels MTV was the Top of mind channel followed by Channel V and Music Asia. Although ratings for Music Asia are higher than Channel V, it was not mentioned as a preferred channel by the youth as it as a down-market image in this audience. Music as a genre was also doing well among 25-34 years females with MTV taking the lead again, followed by Music Asia and Channel V lagging behind.Discovery has aspirational value for viewers in India. It is a channel which they like to say they watch but, as of now, actual viewership is much lower than claimed viewership.

"Developing a Training Program for the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System in Context","","Fleming, Elizabeth S.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2013-01-01","2013","","","","","","9798263349639","ENG","The Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is an aircraft collision avoidance system designed to prevent mid-air collisions. During an advisory, danger is imminent, and TCAS is assumed to have better, more up-to-date information than the ground operated air traffic control (ATC) facility. Following a TCAS RA is generally the safe course of action during an advisory. However, pilot compliance with RAs is surprisingly low. Results from a TCAS monitoring study show pilots are not complying with many TCAS advisories. As revealed by pilot-submitted Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports, this noncompliance could be attributed, in part, to pilot confusion to TCAS operation as well as misunderstandings of the appropriate response to a TCAS issued advisory.This thesis details the development and evaluation of a TCAS training program intended to improve pilots’ understanding of TCAS use for collision avoidance in a range of traffic situations. The training program integrated Demonstration Based and Event Based Training techniques. Its efficacy was analyzed in an integrated ATC-cockpit simulator study in which eighteen commercial airline pilots were asked to complete the TCAS training program and afterwards experienced twelve experimental traffic events. The trained pilots’ performance was compared to the performance of 16 baseline pilots who did not receive the modified training.Overall, the training program did have a significant impact on the pilots’ behavior and response to TCAS advisories. The measure Time Pilots First Achieved Compliance decreased with the trained pilots, as did the measure Autopilot Disconnect Time AfterA Initiation. Trained pilots exhibited less aggressive performance in response to a TCAS RA (including a decrease in the measures Altitude Deviation Over Duration Of RA, Average Vertical Rate Difference, Maximum Vertical Rate Difference, and Maximum Vertical Rate). The measure Percent Compliance did not significantly vary between trained and baseline pilots, although trained pilots had a more consistent response in the traffic event with conflicting ATC guidance. Finally, on the postexperiment questionnaires, pilots commented on their increase in understanding of TCAS as well as an increase in their trust in the advisory system.Results of this research inform TCAS training objectives provided by the FAA as well as the design of TCAS training. Additionally, conclusions extend more broadly to improved training techniques for other similar complex, time-critical situations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3275487432?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=W%2BLDPDf6KF5pY2VG7CQsQC3BsTw%3D",""

It is important to understand the human-related, negative consequences that can occur in the aftermath of a critical incident. Crisis Care Network and International Critical Incident Stress Foundation are two organizations that are available for critical incident training and preparation of critical incident plans. The results indicated that participating businesses are prepared for evacuation; however, none of the surveyed workplaces appeared to be prepared for the spectrum of critical incidents. A recommendation drawn from this research is to involve all employees, giving each a role in the preparedness plans of their workplace. This will enable each employee a greater understanding and a larger degree of participation during a critical incident.

Sleep deprivation and heat stress affect cognitive and psychomotor performance in varying degree. This study was conducted with a view to examine the changes in cognitive and psychomotor performance after acute sleep deprivation of one night and subsequent heat stress for an hour and also to compare the changes in performance due to dual stress of sleep deprivation to that of sleep deprivation alone.Method:Cognitive and psychomotor performance of 20 healthy males randomly divided into two groups (Group A and Group B) of ten each was assessed using PC based visual Working Memory & Vigilance tasks and Finger Dexterity Board Task, after routine normal sleep on Day1 (Stage I) and after acute sleep deprivation of one night on Day2 (Stage II) taking two subjects at a time. Then it was assessed on Day2 itself after exposing Group B subject to heat stress of 33.9oC WBGT for an hour and after keeping Group A subject just awake for this extended period (Stage III). Data was analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA, Bonferroni Correction and 2x3 Fisher Exact Test.Results:Significant difference was observed in response time on Working Memory Task in both the groups (p=0.006 for Group A & 0.028 for Group B). Post hoc analysis revealed significant shortening of response time from Stage II to stage III in both the groups, whereas only in Group A from Stage I to II. Correct responses on Working memory Task decreased significantly in Group A (p=0.006) only, from Stage I to Stage II. There was no significant variation within and between both the groups performance on Vigilance Task. Significant prolongation of time taken to complete Finger Dexterity Task was seen only in Group A (p=0.015), but not in Group B (p=0.155). Post hoc analysis of Group A data revealed that ‘time taken’ prolonged significantly only from Stage I to Stage II. No significant difference was seen in pattern of change in performance between the groups.Interpretation & Conclusion:The significant shortening of response time from stage II to Stage III in Group B can not be interpreted as effect of heat only because other group also showed similar reduction without heat and therefore it can be attributed to ‘time of day’, arousal, motivation or to effect of some other unaccounted factors. Non finding of significant variation within Group B on any other performance parameters may also be interpreted as robustness (low susceptibility to effects of sleep deprivation) of Group B subjects. Acute sleep deprivation of one night with subsequent heat stress has not been found to cause any significant changes in cognitive and psychomotor performance as measured by Working Memory & Vigilance tasks and Finger Dexterity board task respectively.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2848391959?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=GRvlGczkMENqHUZIDQ6XNdvCACA%3D",""

To understand tutoring in dynamic tasks, we conducted a field observation of students being given messages by a flight instructor. Five low flight time student pilots were asked to perform nine instrument flight tasks while being tutored by an instructor pilot in both a virtual simulator flight and in a real airplane flight. The data from our study were compared to two prominent models of one-on-one tutoring. Only a small portion of the utterances made by the tutor or by the student matched previous accounts, suggesting that a new approach is needed to address tutoring during instrument flight instruction.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/89139996?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=YODPbNoQhse%2Br%2BVMpeH926jeEkI%3D",""

This study was based primarily on a phenomenological research design, which led to a set of inductively derived conjectures. The study’s sample consisted of 10 GA airports that had at least 10 times the number of GA operations than the number of air carrier (commercial) operations as reported in the Air Traffic Activity Data System (ATADS) across five Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regions (Alaskan, Southwest, Northwest Mountain, Southern, and Western Pacific). Using the FAA’s Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) database, it was reported that these 10 GA airports experienced the highest frequency of pilot deviations (PDs), and vehicle/pedestrian deviations (V/PDs) runway incursions events that had occurred over the last 7.5 years (January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2017). Using the qualitative data analysis software tool, Nvivo©, and Spradley’s (1979) approach, the data were organized into three domains, which corresponded to the three research questions (RQs). The results of data analysis led to the development of common themes and patterns (the phenomenological design component), and these common themes and patterns then served as the basis for formulating corresponding conjectures (the first stage of grounded theory design). The findings suggest that there are numerous reasons that contribute to RIs at GA airports such as compromised situation awareness (SA) and communication, airfield access, resource related issues, and attention to reporting RIs. The barriers faced included airfield infrastructure, and pilot related issues; and the lessons learned were that collaborative communication, and modified physical environments can mitigate the occurrences of RIs. The findings are beneficial to airport managers in that it provided a succinct synthesis of RI mitigation information, for some of which can be implemented in the interim, while providing recommendations for what can be done long term to improve aviation safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468699849?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=LnjnMYFNTimmcCsurQTEmWzjGig%3D",""

At The University (TU), a southern university specializing in aviation and aerospace, students are required to adhere to strict alcohol policies, according to Federal Aviation Administration guidelines. TU has limited statistics examining frequency of substance use and perceptions of students. A simple descriptive survey design was utilized to identify use patterns and perceptions among TU students and compare this data to national averages. Using a probability-based simple random sampling strategy, 1,500 students were selected to complete the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey, a web-based survey. 205 surveys were received. Patterns of use at TU demonstrated differences from national norms. Overall alcohol and marijuana use frequency at TU was less than use patterns nationally. Most TU students in the sample reported never having used marijuana, an abstinence rate much higher than reported nationally. Other drug use did not differ from the national sample. Differences were noted between groups, with fraternity members reporting and being perceived as having the highest frequency and amount of alcohol use. Higher alcohol use amounts were reported at fraternity social functions than other locations. However, Greek students reported less marijuana use than other groups and all denied ever using other illicit drugs. TU students residing off-campus self-reported and were perceived as having higher alcohol and marijuana use than on-campus students. It was perceived that males drink at a higher frequency than females, and that males consume more drinks. Yet, females showed greater range of other drug use. TU student athletes did not report alcohol use higher than average. While current pilots reported alcohol use at higher frequency than pilots-in-training, pilots-in-training reported consuming more drinks per setting than current pilots, and greater frequency of binge drinking. Non-pilots reported the lowest alcohol use and binge drinking. The reverse was observed for marijuana: non-pilots as well as pilots-in-training reported the highest range of use.

One of them is stress. Although today living without stress is almost impossible, sources of stress and its remedies vary with respect to job variation and individual perceptions. Aviation sector is one of the professions that have severe and continuous stress.Stress is an inevitable factor in a pilot's life. Its level affects performance as too much stress may detract from the pilot's ability; and not enough stress may cause boredom, less concentration and motivation.It has long been recognized that Army Pilots at all levels are subject to stress on and off the job, which can interfere with effective and efficient job performance as well as job satisfaction. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the causes of stress and their symptoms in pilots` life. The thesis is also intended to find the styles used by pilots to cope with stress conditions.For this reason a questionnaire was developed and administered to 121 aircrew members of Army Aviation School and Training Center Command. The questionnaire involves questions on the causes of stress, the ways to cope with stress conditions, and stress symptoms. After decreasing the number of variables by using factor analysis, scores on 24 scales within these 3 categories (causes of stress, coping styles, symptoms) were quantified and analyzed using descriptive analysis and correlation to reveal problem areas, strengths, and interrelationships. Recommendations also focused on how to use this information by the unit command to guide all efforts in minimizing unnecessary stress and to optimize crewmembers' ability to cope.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2665127727?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=CmtoPZyPNR92OqwF55ddIgaeJ6M%3D",""

Often, difficult life circumstances lead to so-called life stress, which has a significant impact on the cognitive performance of pilots. However, stressful situations such as flying through severe weather or system failures can also lead to cognitive impairments. Due to the constant changes of measures, the unstable aviation industry and the irregular schedules for pilots, it is hypothesized that the increased stress caused by the new situation could influence the safety. This thesis therefore investigates how psychological stress factors in the cockpit influence the safety of flights and to what extent are these factors aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. To be able to measure the changes, incident reports from the anonymous reporting tool ASRS of the U.S. aerospace agency NASA were examined.

In two experiments, participants were asked to perform a hierarchical data entry task in which they were interrupted several times. In experiment 1, novice participants were significantly more likely to commit an error on the first step immediately following an interruption than on any other step. Error rates gradually returned to baseline across the first several steps following an interruption, mirroring the pattern of response times. A bias toward repeating steps rather than skipping steps when an error is made on the resumption point was also found. In experiment 2, comparisons between novices and experts suggest that interruption-induced errors were mitigated with expertise, but response times were not. Nevertheless, experts demonstrated the same gradual return to baseline as novices for both timing and error rate data. Taken together, these results suggest that the disruptive effect of interruptions is not distributed across the span of a task but rather is localized to the first few moments immediately following an interruption. They further suggest a bias in the cognitive system toward redundant actions when errors occur. Finally, these results suggest that training and experience can mitigate interruption-induced errors, but not necessarily the robust resumption lag effect. A quantitative model—the primed retrieval model (Altmann & Trafton, 2007), is expanded to account for these results.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304325859?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=x%2Bd09G6F3OEInA0zWWVikkCp0sE%3D",""

This includes face-to-face communication as well as passive information reception, with no intention to act on the given information. Distributed use of information within groups remains a weak link between actual information, the meaning given to information, and the sense made of the information. In the world of aviation, often times accident investigations point to a breakdown in communication with no indication of how this breakdown occurs. This work distinguishes how this breakdown may occur through understanding human information behavior on the flight deck. This study discerns that high performing flight crews practice different information behaviors than low performing or accident involved flight crews. Principles from information science, psychology, and communication studies are used to analyze how commercial flight crews involved in accidents (fail to) make use of essential, safety critical information through analysis of the related flight transcripts using a Crew Information Behavior Grid. This work serves as a way to operationalize crew resource management through understanding the social practice of information structuring and communication patterns within the distributed collective practice of the flight crew. From this, researchers may be able to identify the role information (needs, seeking, and use) plays in critical communication patterns related to supportive or ineffectual infrastructure used in the negotiation of meaning on the flight deck. This work also serves as a tool to inform crew training and is applicable to other domains where work is supported through distributed collective practice.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305201250?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Kl6WM%2BQcfKVSWp6IutQc60i8%2BKc%3D",""
"Task Engagement and Flow in the Operational Safety of South African Civil Air Traffic Controllers","","Slater, Beverly","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2021-01-01","2021","","","","","","9798302346414","ENG","The field of research on human factors has grown rapidly, partly as a result of the importance of ensuring safety in aviation. Human factors, specifically human errors, contribute to significantly more aviation incidents than any other single factor, accounting for approximately 70% of all accidents and incidents (US National Research Council, 1998). Therefore, in order to continue to improve safety despite increasing air traffic, it is crucial to identify the factors that are the constituents of safety before their absence leads to an incident. This research focused on the human errors made by civil air traffic controller officers (ATCOs) during the high-risk period of shift handover. The aim of the current research was to obtain a deeper understanding of these factors in the South African context.The profession of air traffic control involves a wide array of duties to ensure that aircraft take off, transit between airports, and land safely. Air Traffic Navigation Services (ATNS) have identified a pattern of increased safety incidents that occur within the first 30 minutes of a civil ATCO starting a shift, the first 30 minutes after a civil ATCO returns from a break, and the last 30 minutes of his or her shift. This is referred to as the ‘shift handover period’. ATNS posited that the problem is a lack of mental alertness in ATCOs. The current research aimed to make a contribution to the knowledge and understanding of human factors that play a role in the underlying dynamics of mental alertness, mental task engagement, and flow in ATCOs during this high-risk shift-handover period, in order to assist in minimising safety incidents.The present study investigated the systemic, psychological, and physiological human factors experienced by ATCOs in South Africa.The research was conducted in three phases:Phase 1: Review and analysis of safety incident reports;Phase 2: Examining flow, mental task engagement, and mental workload; andPhase 3: Administering interventions: music and mindfulness.In Phase 1, a total of 123 safety incident reports for the period 2008 to 2012 were analysed. The analysis confirmed that the handover period is indeed a high-risk period.In Phase 2, qualitative data were collected through interviews with11 ATCOs. This data, combined with factors identified from the safety reports, yielded a number of systemic, psychological, and physiological factors that impact the operational safety of ATCOs from a Safety-I perspective (why things go wrong).The high-risk sectors are Approach and Aerodrome. Periods of both high and low traffic volumes are high risk. A number of environmental upgrades are required, including equipment and the rest area, and noise levels need to be reduced. The rostering of ATCOs should be done to ensure sufficient staff, without extending their shifts, and ATCOs should be rostered sufficiently regularly to maintain proficiency. ATCOs require sufficient rest, which should be promoted, and management should ensure that ATCOs take their mandatory leave. From the interviews, it was clear that the relationship between management and ATCOs could be improved, especially through regular and open communication.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3161871796?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Bu56n0iuhpVn979OcDPs0UHj5Ig%3D",""

However, the new measures were not flawless. A terrorist posing as a cabin crew could easily access the cockpit, and the still debated effectiveness of psychometric screening.To prevent another PSUA; the research reviewed relevant events that lead into a potential or actual PSUA and the triggering factors behind it. The research also examines existing measures and related literature covering suicide, psychology, terrorism, aviation security and international organisations views. The available information was widely scattered and heavily cluttered. Hence, it was decided to compile an academically accredited and professionally filtered reference that lists relevant events, establish PSUA triggering factors, identify an effective mitigation and immediately bridge the current measures identified gaps.The research findings, short and long term recommendations are backed up by the author's 30 years of aviation experience and are validated by recognised aviation experts. To address PSUA risk; the research suggests to temporarily maintain the ""two in the flight deck"" procedure, subject to reducing cabin crew risk by limiting in-flight cockpit access to the two senior cabin crews and immediately implementing the research gap bridging recommendations in term of crew specific procedures and training.PSUA long term solution is achieved by addressing the personal factor, that could reduce the risk by 50% through the combination of the following measures; enhanced crew security background checks, enhanced psychometric screening by an aviation experienced company psychiatrist, awareness campaigns and effective crew support programs, along with job security campaigns, real just culture implementation and suicidal behaviour recognition training.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2497484644?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=DavUrw5pCMBtsf0IS8MkUrVIL1E%3D",""
"A Comparison of Pilot Upset Recovery Performance in Simulation and Flight","","Reuter, Christopher Michael","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2019-01-01","2019","","","","","","9781392603697","ENG","Loss of control in-flight (LOC-I) has historically been the leading cause of commercial airline fatalities. In 2009, an investigation of LOC-I accidents revealed four primary causal factors, citing human factors errors as one of the factors. The investigation discovered that one reason for the human errors was due to deficiencies in pilot training from aircraft stalls and upsets. These deficiencies led the FAA and similar international organizations to implement upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT) guidelines for commercial air transport aircraft.The aviation industry uses flight simulators as part of a comprehensive program for pilot training and certification requirements. Although flight simulators can possess a high level of realism, deficiencies remain. Many pilots find simulators to be easier than their real-world counterparts. Even with a high-fidelity FFS, simulator training currently cannot accurately reproduce essential factors that are considered to be within the safety margins of the aircraft, such as roll and pitch rates and g-loading, all of which can lead to high levels of altitude loss, if not managed correctly.This thesis compared upset recovery maneuvers between a simulator and live flight. The study used in the research required the pilots to recover from an upset condition while also performing an additional task of serially adding two numbers. The secondary task provided a physiological baseline cognitive workload measurement that was used to compare the pilots’ increased workload levels during the recovery phase of the flight.The results indicated that the pilots generally performed better during the simulator flights and had less subjective workload and high levels of situation awareness. The physiological-based workload contrasted subjective measures. However, during a live flight upset recovery, pilots may not be able to transfer the skills acquired from a flight simulator and experience higher levels of workload and reduced levels of situation awareness, increasing their potential for an unsuccessful recovery. Suggestions are made that include more use of live aircraft aerobatic training for UPRT and the use of a physiological-based, unbiased workload assessment during pilot training. Additionally, it is suggested using an adaptive training approach to UPRT that incorporates the primary technical flight performance metrics with secondary task performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2378129044?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=5njYkVQ4uLTVvKPavH6WVjBPukI%3D",""
"Sleep in Automated Driving Post-Sleep Driver Performance in Transitions of Control – The Effects of Sleep Inertia","","Wörle, Johanna Barbara","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2023-01-01","2023","","","","","","9798288847134","ENG","Sleep emerges as a legal driver state in automated driving when highly automated driving is introduced to the market and as a misuse of automation already observable in partially automated driving. As long as full autonomy is not realized, the human driver will still be required to or voluntarily intervene in vehicle guidance at some point. Sleep inertia, the post-sleep performance decrement, is identified as a safety risk in domains of transportation where operators are allowed to nap onshift. Empirical evidence on the effects of sleep inertia on driver behaviour, however, is very limited. According to the ‘Activation Theory’, sleep inertia is marked by low arousal which is associated with slowed information processing and overall decreased performance capabilities. Evidence on the effects of sleep inertia on performance comes predominantly from experimental settings that use standardized tasks to assess the effects of sleep inertia on particular cognitive functions. One experimental study that aimed at investigating post-nap effects on driver behaviour takeover scenarios in automated driving was not conclusive due to the lack of a suitable experimental setup. In a first step, the presented thesis aims at creating a research environment that combines methods from sleep science with human factors research paradigms on automated driving to enable the investigation of post-sleep effects on driver behaviour. In Study 1 the manipulation of circadian as well as sleep-homeostatic factors proved highly successful to trigger sleep stage N2 in participants in a driving simulator setting. Sleep was measured with electroencephalography according to the international clinical standard. Additionally, cardiac and electrodermal measures showed good properties to detect sleep in drivers during automated driving. This finding is especially relevant for the development of driver monitoring systems that are able to detect a sleeping driver. After proving effective, the sleep paradigm of Study 1 was maintained for the following two studies. The main aim of the presented thesis was addressed in Study 2 and Study 3: The effects of sleep inertia on driver behaviour in transitions of control from automated to manual driving were investigated in a controlled setting. In Study 2, drivers were awakened during stable sleep while driving in automated mode and exposed to a takeover scenario. Compared to a condition after wakefulness, the drivers’ reactions in response to an RtI were delayed and drivers visually searched for more relevant cues to understand the situation. After sleep, more driving errors were coded in the transition of control phase and the drivers experienced the situation as unpleasant. After the transition, manual driving behaviour on the tracking control loop was impaired under sleep inertia (Study 3a). Under sleep inertia, drivers compensated for impaired performance by reducing the driving speed. Even though longitudinal and lateral vehicle guidance were more unstable under the state of sleepiness too, drivers did not compensate by reducing the driving speed (Study 3). A sub-sample of drivers that were questioned about their subjective experience of taking control back after sleep reported high stress and a feeling of grogginess. Drivers were aware of their restricted performance capabilities. The reported stress challenges the assumption that performance decrements due to sleep inertia are explained by an overall low arousal. The present findings suggest a complex relationship of arousal and performance in a transition of control under sleep inertia. The high physiological arousal is hypothesized to be linked to subjective stress in the takeover situation which reflects a state of high arousal. At the same time, the drivers’ cognitive processing is slowed due to a state of low neurophysiological arousal. Additionally, emotional and motivational factors are suggested to additionally shape driver behaviour after sleep. The findings of the present thesis suggest that in order for sleep to become a safe driver state, human machine interfaces have to account for performance impairments due to and a negative experience of sleep inertia in transitions of control. ","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3237920537?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Nlw4h8fwi9dU2Ctp5qjiR6ue%2BIQ%3D",""
"The Design and Development of a Best Practice Use-Of-Force Training Model for the Private Security Industry","","Schneider, Gavriel","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2012-01-01","2012","","","","","","9798283158396","ENG","The private security industry plays an ever increasing role in protecting people and assets globally. The use of force in the private security environment is an area of concern for many groups and individuals. Role-players range from individual officers, who may have to put their lives in harm’s way whilst carrying out their duties, to regulators tasked with enforcing legislative compliance. There are various points of view and levels of concern regarding use of force by private security officers. Incidents where innocent civilians were killed by private security contractors in countries such as Iraq are most relevant to this study. Equally, incidents involving Crowd Controllers who may use force on a nightly basis to manage rowdy patrons, are just as important (and sometimes just as lethal). With the roles of traditional policing and the private security industry becoming more inter-related every day, the use of force by the private security industry cannot be ignored.The core concerns regarding use of force are twofold. Firstly is the issue of the use of excessive force and secondly is the need to constantly enhance the safety levels for all parties (security officers, assailants and innocent bystanders). Addressing these concerns is impossible without a systematic structure that ensures officers are adequately trained and equipped for the job-related activities that they must conduct. This research indicated the need not only for an integrated system of training and acclimatisation (familiarisation) to the use of force, but also for a model of assessment that measures use-of-force competency. The perishable nature of use-of-force skills means that training should expand to include on-going refresher and skills training as well as regular competency assessments. The need to train officers for the real thing is of paramount importance. They need to be taught to manage adrenal response in order to perform effectively under the extreme duress of an attack situation. Existing force continua provide guidelines for use-of-force but fail to provide recommendations on how officers should be trained to actually apply the guidelines (in physical and psychological terms) that most continua prescribe.Early on in the research it was identified that the scope and duties of officers in the private security industry are very wide. The vast majority of security officers operate in a low risk static guarding role, where the likelihood of having to utilise force is very low. The rest of the industry engages in higher risk activities such as Cash-in-Transit, Crowd Control or Close Protection. In order to create an appropriate structure applicable for use-of-force training, the officers in the security industry were divided into four broad categories based on their level of use-of-force options and the risk level of the environment that they operate in. These four categories are as follows:1. Security officers who operate unarmed with no alternative weapons (this means that the officer is completely unarmed and does not carry any ancillary equipment such as a torch or handcuffs). This category is applicable to low risk level functions that have a low likelihood of officers having to face an attack situation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3224596845?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=qu2iQHyl3z4i892yKvx11Xd04JE%3D",""

"FSA Based Analysis of Deck Officers’ Non-Technical Skills in Crisis Situations","","Saeed, Farhan","PQDT - UK & Ireland","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2015-01-01","2015","","","","","","9798557038041","ENG","A review of maritime accidents conducted in 2006 confirms that human error is the main contributing factor in maritime accidents. This study illustrates that major maritime accidents are not caused by technical problems but by failure of the crew to respond to the situation appropriately.Non-technical skills (NTS) encompass both interpersonal and cognitive skills such as situation awareness, teamwork, decision-making, leadership, managerial skills, communication and language skills, etc. In a crisis situation good NTS allow the deck officers to recognise a problem quickly and manage the situation and team safely and effectively. As a result, the evaluation and grading of deck officers’ NTS is necessary to assure safety at sea.This research aims to identify the links between maritime accidents and deck officers’ NTS and identifies significant criteria and their contributions to the deck officers’ NTS by using the Formal Safety Assessment concept. Taxonomy of deck officers’ non-technical skills was developed by conducting interviews with experts and collecting NTS weighting data for calculating each NTS weight by the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method.Based on the taxonomy of the deck officers NTS behavioural markers were developed for the assessment of their NTS in the bridge simulator. A set of bridge simulator crisis scenarios was developed to assess deck officers’ NTS.Two sets of Chief Mate volunteer students’ NTS performance was assessed in the bridge simulator. One set of students are those who have not obtained NTS training i.e. HELM (Human Element Leadership and Management) and the other set of students are those who have obtained the HELM training as part of their main course of study. All groups’ NTS performances are calculated by the ER (Evidential Reasoning) Algorithm and are compared to see if there are any improvements in the NTS performance with the HELM training. After comparison it was found that NTS performance of the groups with HELM training was only 0.8% better than the NTS performance of the groups without HELM training.HELM course effectiveness is evaluated and suggestions are given for further improvements to the course. Cost benefit analysis for improving deck officers’ NTS was carried out by Bayesian Network and Decision Tree Model.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1780155108?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=7Fg2MgIeaGG%2FzA%2FDTxIWAYa8ix0%3D",""

This model makes specific predictions related to human interactions with machines in complex systems and provides a useful framework for designers to follow when determining future task allocations. This theory predicts that operators of systems requiring decision-making should be assigned tasks requiring controlled processing. Once a problem is perceived, this model suggests that the system should be designed such that the control tasks previously allocated to the operator could be reallocated to the machine, thus freeing the individual's problem-solving workspace. It is shown that tasks, which use automatic processing, have no effect on problem-solving ability either in ensuring that resources are available or during the actual problem-solving period. The research also demonstrates that the workspace where controlled processing occurs varies as a function of taskload in low workload conditions. If subsequently incorporated into future design processes it is believed that the use of the Reserve Resources Model offers the possibility of increasing the level of safety in complex human-machine systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304431599?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=TpOcPetOZFpHyfPBn6GXOS4kKDI%3D",""
"Enhancing Robustness to Forecast Errors in Availability Control for Airline Revenue Management","","Gonçalves, Tiago Ribeiro","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2023-01-01","2023","","","","","","9798382511184","ENG","Traditional revenue management systems are built under the assumption of independent demand per fare. The fare transformation theory is a methodology to adjust fares that allows for the continued use of optimization algorithms and seat inventory control methods, even with the shift towards dependent demand. Under a sell-up demand model, this marginal revenue transformation reduces the value of a specific fare by a varying margin, dependent on the upsell probability to higher fare productsSince accurate demand forecasts are a key input to this methodology, it is reasonable to assume that for a scenario with uncertainties and disturbances it may deliver suboptimal performance. Factors such as lack or bad quality of historical booking data, inaccurate demand models, and inherent demand variability contribute to the complexity of forecasting demand in airline revenue management systems. Moreover, airlines faced striking challenges in demand forecasting during and after COVID-19, struggling to adapt to an environment characterized by unstable customer behavior, prominent schedule instability, and continuously shifting travel restrictions.This work demonstrates, firstly, that the fare transformation theory is a theoretical dominant approach under perfect conditions, even under a varying range of input parameters. Secondly, it lacks robustness to forecast errors. A Monte Carlo simulation replicating a revenue management system under mild assumptions indicates that a forecast error of ±20% can potentially prompt a necessity to adjust the margin employed in the fare transformation theory by −10%. This may vary slightly according to other input parameters, such as upsell probability, expected demand, capacity, and fare structure related variables.To capture the relationships between the optimal margin for seat availability control and input parameters, a tree-based machine learning model is employed. This model highlights the forecast error as the predominant factor, with bias playing an even more pivotal role than variance. On the one hand, when bias assumes positive values, meaning that the forecast is overestimating the real demand, the margin from the fare transformation theory needs to be adjusted down. On the other hand, with an escalating variance that signifies a progressively worsening forecast, there is a corresponding need to downwardly adjust the margin.To validate the dominance of the predictive model under imperfect conditions, an out-ofsample study with 100 generated flights is performed for distinct scenarios. For the setting with a forecast error of ±40% and a possible systematic error of ±10%, the predictive model with margin corrections outperforms the fare transformation theory in terms of expected revenue in 0.0144%. For a network carrier with thousands of flights a year, it can be an important differentiator.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3059430003?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=pUYXX1DvwK7xTovbSBNEXkO%2BmRo%3D",""

The purpose of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, a relationship or difference existed between the cognitive context of the classroom and the cognitive context of the aircraft for private pilot students. Subjects were 34 college students from three intact groups of private pilot ground school students from three colleges or universities in Oklahoma. Each subject received a pretest given by their ground school instructor followed by a practice test and posttest treatment. The posttest treatment was called the Flight Deck Cognitive Emulator. The emulator was computer-mediated and recorded the scores internally using programmed commands. In addition to measures of central tendency, Pearson  r and T-test statistics were used to assess relationships and differences and to test the hypotheses. Findings and conclusions. There appeared to be differences between the three intact groups in terms of mean age (OU 24, Rose State 31, OSU 18) and the mean of pretest scores (OU 84, Rose State 88, OSU 79). These differences may have reflected instructor capabilities or student motivation. Although differences did exist between intact groups, those subjects who volunteered from within each group resembled the greater population from which each was drawn. A high correlation (r = .98) existed between pretest and posttest scores. This may have indicated a strong relationship between knowledge-based items similar to both tests. However, pretest/posttest score means indicated that a significant difference existed between the context of cognition in the classroom and the context emulated by the Flight Deck Cognitive Emulator (OU 84/68, Rose State 88/73, OSU 79/67).

Extensive research in the United States of America, sponsored by the Federal Aviation Authority, has proved that pilot decisionmaking can be improved through education and training, resulting in reduced accident levels. Various programmes have been developed and are being applied in the U.S.A. and Canada at the abinitio pilot training level. Most international airlines and military aviation authorities have applied this knowledge to their own training programmes, but there appears to be a lack of co-ordinated follow-up, world-wide, for existing general aviation pilots to be exposed to these important developments. This situation exists in South Africa also, but additionally, there is an urgent need to .. introduce the decision-making programmes into ab-initio pilot training. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention which addresses the problem of exposing existing aircraft pilots to pilot decision-making training.The research method which was followed is the developmental research model of Nel and Nel (1992). The disciplined approach to intervention development in the human sciences which the model demands, ensures that the parameters for the successful development of the intervention are clearly established in advance of its application, so that its validity can be assessed on an acceptable academic basis.The innovative intervention was applied to a sample of 400 pilots taken at random from the Pilot Register of the Department of Transport: Directorate of Civil Aviation. Following the application of the intervention, a follow-up questionnaire was mailed to all recipients, resulting in a satisfactory response level of over 14% versus a targetted response-level of 12Y:z%. The analysis of the results from the questionnaires shows an overwhelming acceptance of the intervention by pilots and there are indications that it has produced positive attitude changes in some individuals. The results clearly indicate the validity of the intervention, with minor modifications, for broadscale application to all South African pilots. The possibility that the concept can be used internationally will also need to be investigated.This study suggests that further research into hazardous attitudes, and whether or not these form part of personality, could be useful in working towards the thus-far-elusive goal of determining whether or not accident-proneness is a trait which can be identified in individuals. If such a measure could be validated it could result in a quantum leap forward in reducing pilot-caused aviation accidents.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2550249495?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=6U%2Fl2WrWW%2FwGmDv19Et0nhGHpmw%3D",""

The purpose of this qualitative, archival case study was to explore the use of Situated SA (SSA) as an accident investigation tool capable of explaining the sociotechnical system within the cockpit during aircraft overrun events.  The research questions had a threefold purpose: identify outliers within the scenarios that may have led to SA shortfalls within the overrun scenarios, evaluate the efficacy of SSA as an accident analysis tool, and provide additional information to support or conflict with SSA theory.  This researcher examined official accident reports, transcripts of cockpit voice recorders, and transcripts of interviews conducted by NTSB investigators with the aircrew involved shortly after the accidents.   The majority of outliers in each scenario were attributed to human error. The most common outliers across the scenarios were a failure of the pilot to take appropriate action and the lack of training for events dealing with snowy runways and poor visibility.   There were no unexplained phenomena using the SSA model.  Despite the differences between scenarios, the consistent reporting method by the NTSB and the structured tenets of the SSA model allowed for the categorization and comparison of the cognitive processes of the accident pilots.  However, data offloading (a key tenet of SSA) was difficult to assess based on the chosen data sources, calling into question whether pilots download information from the environment during time critical, off-nominal situations such as runway overruns.  Based on this case study, it is recommended that pilots prepare for overrun scenarios prior to landing, and system failures during deteriorating weather conditions should be added to pilot training syllabi.  Also, other SA models should be assessed for their capability to explain cognitive processes within the cockpit of overrun scenarios. Finally, conducting similar studies for accidents in other phases of flight would build a more holistic picture of the capabilities of the SA models in the aviation context.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1768055204?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ItMNhlL8WQoT7uO1jsf896OHlHE%3D",""

In order to provide a safer environment, it is important to identify the cause of human error and performance at a specific time. Human involvement in cockpit operations can be affected by permanent characteristics or situational circumstances in the form of physical, mental and environmental loads. Therefore, an attempt is made to study the effects of cockpit conditions, i.e., instrument settings and 90 dBA (decibel in A scale) pre-recorded cockpit noise, on cognitive performance for nine cognitive tests of the Complex Cognitive Abilities Battery (CCAB). The other performance measures are mean heart rate (MHR), standard deviation for heart rate (SDHR), subjective ratings (NASA Task Load Index) and correct (%) readings of the altitude and air speed for fifteen male and fifteen female subjects. The 16PF personality profiles, visual and hearing acuity of the subjects are also determined.The results indicate that there is a statistically significant effect of the CCAB tests on cognitive performance (test scores) and SDHR. The instrument setting has significant effects on the CCAB test scores and TLX ratings. Noise has significant effects on MHR along with TLX ratings. There are no significant differences between gender and pilot/non-pilot groups. Findings indicate that subjective measures are sensitive to both mental and physical stressors. However, physiological measures tend to be sensitive only to physical stressors, whereas cognitive measures are sensitive only to mental stressors. In complex systems where the individuals are exposed not only to mental stressors but also to physical stressors, the performance measures should be more comprehensive and should include cognitive and physiological as well as subjective measures. With this approach, the effects of the system on the individuals may be established in a comprehensive way so that the system requirements and design improvements can be determined.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/303952899?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=E3pUVBVaQm%2FBamQXTNaPTRO365E%3D",""

While most of the studies airline choice/service quality only identify airlines service attributes essential to customers, this study employed personal values to extend and provide the reasons why airline service attributes are not or essential to passengers. Personal values are presented in the literature as the ultimate life goals individuals seek to attain in all aspects of their lives; hence, guide their behaviour. Based on this, the main objective of this study was to examine and identify the consumer (passenger) personal values that underpin the evaluation of airline service attributes used to choose an airline within the South African domestic passenger market. To achieve this objective, together with the secondary objectives, a quantitative descripto-explanatory research design was employed to guide data collection and analysis. A sample of 324 respondents was selected using a hybrid technique of convenience, and snowball sampling techniques and data were collected using both an online and hardcopy questionnaire. Data obtained were sorted and cleaned for analysis using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS 26) and the Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS Version 26) software. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to assess factor structures of observed variables and identify latent constructs. The factorability of portrait value questionnaire (PVQ) items was determined using the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Hypotheses were tested using the backward multiple regression analysis, Whitney-Mann test, Spearman correlation and hierarchical regression with Hayes’ Process Macro. The study identified five of Schwartz’s 19 refined values as significantly influencing the evaluation and prioritisation of airline service attributes. A state of indifference among customers was found when the impact of airline service attributes was tested, with only onboard services found to significantly influence post-purchase outcomes such as satisfaction, loyalty and repeat purchase behaviour. It was also found that passengers did not distinguish between low-cost and full-service carriers. Income only moderated the influence of stimulation and self-direction thought values on airline service attributes while marketing communications effort was found to have a direct than a moderating role. In the main, these findings bring a novel and rich way of explaining airline choice through personal values. The results are essential for airline market segmentation, positioning and the development of airline products or features that match passenger desired life goals (personal values) which are touted as a guide to their choice behaviour.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3224576964?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=hw1S%2Bd7mqQk15QE0xFT7bTcucJQ%3D",""

Earlier studies conducted during a short time frame, of forced wakefulness, have yielded conflicting results. The present study examined temporal variations in vigilance, working memory and arithmetic abilities across eight hours of acute sleep deprivation during an overnight period of forced wakefulness.Methods:Experiment involved hourly measurement of performance (response accuracy and latency) in the above tasks and recording of EEG (F3, C3, P3, O1, F4, C4, P4 and O2 configuration) in a group of 18 healthy male non smokers (31±3 yr) during the above period of sleep deprivation. Tasks were practiced till performance reached asymptotic levels. An artifact-free epoch of 4 seconds was submitted to FFT for spectral analysis. Total and constituent (δ, θ, α & β) power in frontal (F3 and F4) and parieto-occipital (P3, O1, P4 & O2) regions was analyzed during resting sitting and each of the task conditions. Due to significant departures from normality, a nonparametric (Friedman’s) ANOVA was employed for statistical analysis.Results:No variation in the performance in any of the tasks was seen across the period of study. Total and δ power in the frontal region decreased significantly when the subjects were resting sitting. These changes disappeared during engagement of the subjects in the task. All the task conditions exhibited a significant reduction in β power in the parieto-occipital region.

This, in combination with associated risk factors such as stress and fatigue from extended hours and early shift work, household disputes, significant life stressors, and family history of depression create an environment that compromises flight safety.

Of the protective measures brought about as a result of the invention of the bomber, the blackout was by far the most intrusive and extensive form of civil defence. Yet the historiography of the home front and the bombing war in Britain and Germany has tended to sideline the blackout, or else ignore it entirely.The lack of study given to the blackout is at odds with the scale of its impact across wartime society. This thesis furthers understanding of the blackout and the social history of the British and German home fronts by contextualising the blackout within the development of aviation, and its social and economic effects. It also examines the impact technology could have on the relationship between state and citizens, and addresses the lack of comparative research on Britain and Germany during the Second World War.The thesis draws on extensive research conducted in local and national government archives in Britain and Germany, as well as a wide range of secondary literature on the war and inter-war period. It argues that the blackout was a profound expansion of the state into the lives of each nation’s citizens, and though it was set within two politically very different states, it brought with it similar practical and social problems. The blackout, as the most ‘social’ form of civil defence, is an ideal aspect of the war by which to compare the British and German home fronts. Ultimately, the differences between the two countries were less important than the shared sense of obligation that the blackout principle was intended to foster within the wartime community.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1040522329?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3gfXFr%2BFNNrDDdi1Hn4JHrCliUw%3D",""

However, immersive virtual reality allows people to occupy avatars that are different from them in a perceptually realistic manner. We examine how occupying an avatar with the superhero ability to fly increases helping behavior.Principal Findings Using a two-by-two design, participants were either given the power of flight (their arm movements were tracked to control their flight akin to Superman’s flying ability) or rode as a passenger in a helicopter, and were assigned one of two tasks, either to help find a missing diabetic child in need of insulin or to tour a virtual city. Participants in the “super-flight” conditions helped the experimenter pick up spilled pens after their virtual experience significantly more than those who were virtual passengers in a helicopter.Conclusion The results indicate that having the “superpower” of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman). This research illustrates the potential of using experiences in virtual reality technology to increase prosocial behavior in the physical world.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1327979306?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=U7oLVs9Czuu2HawiaAzxjltVkF0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055003"

The population was commercial aviation pilots from different generations and genders including the baby boomers, Generation X, and the millennials flying for approved FAA commercial airlines within the United States. An online survey was used for the quantitative component ( N = 166) and a semi-structured interview for the qualitative component (N = 11). The quantitative component resulted failure to reject all hypotheses, and the qualitative component revealed five overarching themes: CRM processes work in general, personality differences instead of gender differences, perceived generational differences, attitudes, and the need for females to prove themselves. Post hoc reliability analyses revealed low internal consistency of the CMAQ, the instrument for measuring pilot attitudes toward CRM.

They do so in a unique service delivery environment compared with other service providers, which presents several difficulties and even barriers to effective service delivery. In this study, the service delivery (which consisted of service-delivery performance and servicerecovery performance) of international flight attendants was investigated. A theoretical model was proposed to illustrate the unique factors that might influence their service-delivery and service-recovery performance. Data were collected using an online questionnaire that was completed by 228 international flight attendants globally. The results indicated that their working conditions and demanding passengers led to fatigue. However, fatigue did not directly curtail their service-delivery performance. Supervisory support improved teamwork, which influenced service-delivery performance directly and service-recovery performance indirectly. Work experience enhanced teamwork directly and both servicedelivery performance and service-recovery performance indirectly. Given that the management of international airlines cannot change the physical environment in which flight attendants deliver their in-flight services, this study highlights several strategies that could be used to manage onboard staff to overcome the barriers to effective service delivery. Doing so should enhance customer satisfaction, cost savings, and employee well-being - all of which would benefit airlines in the long term.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3243714095?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=7twGw%2BM0CjsTpQIRfNnTNKay4Qc%3D",""

Research factors included (a) purchasing perceptions, which consisted of satisfaction, loyalty, perceived value, and service quality; (b) social environment, which consisted of age, gender, and cultural differences relative to Hofstede’s (1980) cultural dimensions; and (c) experiences, which consisted of frequent flyer status and Internet use frequency. A convenience sample was solicited from graduate students (master’s and doctoral) studying at colleges/universities in northern and central Florida. The sample size used to test the study’s hypotheses consisted of 345 participants. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that loyalty and the Masculinity–Femininity cultural dimension were strong predictors of eWOM activities, while loyalty, perceived value, age, the Uncertainty Avoidance cultural dimension, and eWOM activities were strong predictors of purchasing involvement. The findings also showed that eWOM activities fully mediated the relationship between loyalty and purchasing involvement, and partially mediated the relationship between purchasing involvement and the cultural dimensions of Power Distance and Masculinity–Femininity, respectively. Findings suggest that improving passengers’ loyalty via eWOM activities can help inform their purchasing decisions in the digital era. Moreover, eWOM activities can help passengers who live in high power distance and masculine cultures to easily make a purchasing decision relative to products and services of U.S. airlines. Thus, eWOM activities should be used as a promotional instrument to help inform passengers’ purchasing decisions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468697356?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=vXyfmYoeYSJCsVqGErhPoDpAIy0%3D",""

In order to better understand the effect of stress on cognitive performance, and whether this effect is related to an autonomic response to stress, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used as a testing platform along with a 2-Choice Reaction Time Task. When considering the nature and importance of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) work and the fact that they are subjected to high levels of stress, this study was conducted with a sample of ATCs (n = 11). Linear Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features were extracted from ATCs electrocardiogram (ECG) acquired using a medical-grade wearable ECG device (Vital Jacket® (1-Lead, Biodevices S.A, Matosinhos, Portugal)). Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were also used to measure perceived stress. TSST produced statistically significant changes in some HRV parameters (Average of normal-to-normal intervals (AVNN), Standard Deviation of all NN (SDNN), root mean square of differences between successive rhythm-to-rhythm (RR) intervals (RMSSD), pNN20, and LF/HF) and subjective measures of stress, which recovered after the stress task. Although these short-term changes in HRV showed a tendency to normalize, an impairment on cognitive performance was evident. Despite that participant’s reaction times were lower, the accuracy significantly decreased, presenting more errors after performing the acute stress event. Results can also point to the importance of the development of quantified occupational health (qOHealth) devices to allow for the monitoring of stress responses.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2108405510?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=AsaZeOrp0aNTZsKo%2FYg%2F%2BYpZ%2Bfw%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15061080"
"Adaptive Standard Operating Procedures for Complex Disasters","","Harwood, Shawn","Homeland Security Affairs","Scholarly Journals","","","","2017-03-01","Mar 2017","n/a","","","1558643X","","","ENG","The nature of disasters has evolved, but emergency management has not kept pace with the change. Today’s crisis environment is subject to countless influences—a product of our globalized, complex society—which produce random and volatile events. Despite the unpredictability of modern disasters, the Homeland Security Enterprise still adheres to prediction-dependent standard operating procedures (SOPs) to guide emergency response. As a result, police, firefighters, and other crisis professionals are less able to manage complex crises.BACKGROUNDProfessional crisis responders perform their duties using four essential tools: professional training, job-specific technology, accumulated work experience, and SOPs.[1] The SOP anticipates the operating environment and provides a checklist of recommended actions to accomplish an objective. Sociologists Charles Parker and Eric Stern claim, “SOPs are based on past experience and expectation.”[2] As long as the actual event adheres to the prediction, personnel can rely on the SOP to impart relevant guidance. However, when reality diverges from the anticipated scenario, SOP guidance becomes less useful.Beginning in the late twentieth century, the global community experienced tremendous improvements in telecommunications and information sharing, allowing agents within this worldwide system to interact with and exert unprecedented influence on each other. This significant increase in connectivity and feedback intensified the complexity of many social systems. Sociologists David Snowden and Mary Boone describe complexity as the behavior of large numbers of agents dynamically reacting to and influencing each other within a bounded system.[3] One of the essential characteristics of complexity is that behavioral outcomes often prove non-intuitive and difficult to predict. Modern disasters can also demonstrate complex characteristics, erupting quickly and evolving in unexpected ways.Modern crises often demonstrate the prediction-defiant characteristics of complexity. To examine these unpredictable characteristics and assess the utility of SOP-driven crisis response vis-à-vis adaptive behavior, this thesis explores three modern crises that demonstrated complex characteristics: the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the Tohoku Tsunami/Fukushima Dai’ichi nuclear incident. Each of these events exhibited complex characteristics and affords the opportunity to assess both SOP-driven and adaptive responses.The case studies consistently showed that SOPs provided inadequate guidance in these crises while adaptive approaches would have been more effective in the complex environments in which the crises occurred. When the actual disasters deviated from the prediction, emergency responders found themselves adhering to irrelevant procedures. For instance, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attempted to follow a hijacking SOP, its officers failed to recognize that the event had become a terror attack. Alternatively, the U.S. Coast Guard successfully supported the maritime evacuation of Manhattan during the 9/11 attacks by consciously departing from SOP guidance. While instances of adaptable behavior did not significantly mitigate these crises, they serve to illustrate the advantages of adaptive behavior approaches over rote, SOP-driven responses in the complex environment.THE ADAPTIVE DESIGN PROPOSALSThe fundamental weakness in SOP guidance for complex crises is its static approach to a variable environment. To mitigate this vulnerability, SOP-driven crisis response must pivot to embrace an adaptive posture. Toward that end, the thesis recommends two methods to integrate adaptability into SOP-driven crisis response. These proposals make use of contemporary research into complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory and a practical application of the Socratic method to the emergency response paradigm.Louise Comfort et al. describe the essential nature of CAS as “the spontaneous reallocation of energy and action to achieve a collective goal in a changing environment.”[4] Essentially, CAS describes the adaptive behavior that agents must demonstrate to achieve their objectives within a complex system. The ability to engage in flexible, dynamic responses to unexpected deviations is necessary, particularly when navigating the hazardous environment of a complex disaster. Similarly, Mary Uhl-Bien, Russ Marion, and Bill McKelvey contend that emergency responders must function as a CAS, following a course dictated by a dynamic interaction with the environment rather than by bureaucratic protocols.[5]The Socratic method is a particularly relevant tool for emergency response in a complex crisis as it promotes an active search for knowledge to achieve comprehension. Its emphasis on challenging assumptions and re-evaluating a problem prepares emergency responders to expect an evolving scenario. Therefore, it is an ideal foundation to develop a dynamic process for succeeding in a complex environment.The first proposal is the incorporation of adaptability prompts into pre-existing crisis SOPs. Based on the Socratic method, these prompts urge emergency responders to challenge their assumptions about the crisis event and continually seek a better way to achieve their objectives. These instructional steps help identify unanticipated events or behaviors in the field and adjust the crisis response plans accordingly. The proposal of adaptability prompts is a simple upgrade to pre-existing SOPs that urges awareness of complexity and promotes adaptive behavior.Patrick Lagadec and Benjamin Topper recommend the provision of cognitive assistance during an emergency.[6] Their analysis suggests that leading emergency response actions in the field while constantly evaluating the crisis environment is a task that may exceed the capacity of a single crisis professional. To accommodate this dilemma, the second proposal recommends the creation of a crisis co-pilot, an ad hoc advisor who helps the lead emergency responder identify any divergence from predicted behavior and encourages adaptation in the field. Essentially, the crisis co-pilot assists the lead emergency responder in adhering to the Socratic tenets recommended by the adaptability prompts, reminding him to challenge initial expectations in the crisis scenario and adapt the operational plan to accommodate the unexpected.A COMPUTER SIMULATION TO SUPPORT THE ADAPTIVE DESIGN PROPOSALSA multi-agent computer simulation is a framework for approximating human decisions within a virtual system to identify the best means for a desired outcome. The computer simulation cannot represent every nuance in human behavior or unpredicted influences in a complex system, so experimental conclusions appear as “if/then” statements rather than concrete assertions. While these results are only hypothetical, they can effectively promote or denigrate a policy proposal by quantifying and depicting its potential value. To illustrate the potential benefit of the adaptive design proposals, the thesis presents a computer simulation based on the FAA response on the morning of September 11th.The simulation experiment approximated the hypothetical value of the adaptive design proposals by incrementally increasing the FAA’s ability to detect the first hijacked airliner on 9/11 as a threat. The goal of this experiment—the point at which the adaptive design proposals achieve a meaningful improvement in the scenario outcome—was to prompt the order to launch alert fighters in time to intercept the second hijacked airliner before it struck the World Trade Center. The outcome of the experiment suggests that if the adaptive design proposals yielded a 25 percent improvement in FAA threat detection, the fighters could have intercepted the second airliner. These results, therefore, may be more broadly construed to indicate that the adaptive design proposals could yield a significant benefit to the field of crisis response.CONCLUSIONWhile ineffective SOPs do not presuppose the failure of emergency responders in every complex event—the quality of their experience and technology arguably overshadows the shortfalls of these static guidelines—they remain a flawed yet fixable problem within the emergency response field. As such, this thesis proposed two executable methods to integrate adaptability into SOP-driven emergency response. By incorporating adaptability prompts into crisis SOPs and instituting the role of a crisis co-pilot, response agencies can more effectively manage complex emergencies. Further, by implementing these steps to integrate adaptability into standardized emergency response, crisis professionals can better manage complex disasters and, in doing so, better protect their communities.[1] The author bases this statement on 18 years of experience in federal law enforcement as both a criminal investigator and an emergency medical technician.[2] Charles F.

The community college in this study has experienced the same disappointing results. While most aviation colleges use traditional lecture and discussion instruction, this has not proven effective for this community college with its increasingly diverse population. It was believed that the implementation of cooperative learning strategies would help these aviation students achieve improved academic performance through higher levels of student engagement. The purpose of this quasi-experimental quantitative study was to measure the impact of a cooperative learning treatment on student engagement in a diverse group of community college freshman enrolled in an aviation fundamentals course. The cooperative learning treatment group was compared to a control group receiving instruction through lecture and discussion only. Student engagement was measured through the College Student Experiences Questionnaire (CSEQ) for three variables: Quality of Effort, Student Perception of the College Environment, and Student Estimate of Gains. Analysis of CSEQ data found that the treatment group experienced a greater increase in student engagement ranging from 9% to 23% across all three variables. Women and minorities in the treatment group reported improved student engagement over their peers in the control group.

To assess and ensure safety, it would be useful to be able to be able to predict the visibility, to a human observer, of an aircraft of specified size, shape, distance, and coloration. Examples include assuring safe separation among aircraft and between aircraft and unmanned vehicles, design of airport control towers, and efforts to enhance or suppress the visibility of military and rescue vehicles. We have recently developed a simple metric of pattern visibility, the Spatial Standard Observer (SSO). In this report we examine whether the SSO can predict visibility of simulated aircraft images. We constructed a set of aircraft images from three-dimensional computer graphic models, and measured the luminance contrast threshold for each image from three human observers. The data were well predicted by the SSO. Finally, we show how to use the SSO to predict visibility range for aircraft of arbitrary size, shape, distance, and coloration.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1289215096?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=0xcZ%2F2BPsgzzTSImufKP%2FwaHEBY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005594"

However, faces also enjoy an advantage at the early stage of basic-level detection, as demonstrated by efficient visual search for faces among nonface objects. In the present study, we asked (1) whether the face advantage in detection is a unique signature of face expertise, or whether it generalizes to other objects of expertise, and (2) whether expertise in face detection is intrinsically linked to expertise in face individuation. We compared how groups with varying degrees of object and face expertise (typical adults, developmental prosopagnosics [DP], and car experts) search for objects within and outside their domains of expertise (faces, cars, airplanes, and butterflies) among a variable set of object distractors. Across all three groups, search efficiency (indexed by reaction time slopes) was higher for faces and airplanes than for cars and butterflies. Notably, the search slope for car targets was considerably shallower in the car experts than in nonexperts. Although the mean face slope was slightly steeper among the DPs than in the other two groups, most of the DPs' search slopes were well within the normative range. This pattern of results suggests that expertise in object detection is indeed associated with expertise at the subordinate level, that it is not specific to faces, and that the two types of expertise are distinct facilities. We discuss the potential role of experience in bridging between low-level discriminative features and high-level naturalistic categories.

"Shared responsibility for managing fatigue: Hearing the pilots","","Zaslona, Jennifer L; Karyn M O’Keeffe; Signal, T Leigh; Gander, Philippa H","PLoS One","Scholarly Journals","","13","5","2018-05-01","May 2018","e0195530","","","19326203","","","ENG","In commercial aviation, fatigue is defined as a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, circadian phase, and/or workload. The International Civil Aviation Organisation mandates that responsibility for fatigue risk management is shared between airline management, pilots, and support staff. However, to date, the majority of research relating to fatigue mitigations in long range operations has focused on the mitigations required or recommended by regulators and operators. Little research attention has been paid to the views or operational experience of the pilots who use these (or other) mitigations. This study focused on pilots’ views and experiences of in-flight sleep as the primary fatigue mitigation on long range flights. It also sought information about other fatigue mitigation strategies they use. Thematic analysis was used to explore written comments from diary and survey data collected during long range and ultra-long range trips (N = 291 pilots on three different aircraft types, 17 different out-and-back trips, and four airlines based on three continents). The findings indicate that the recommended fatigue mitigation strategies on long-haul flights (particularly in-flight sleep) are effective and well-utilised, consistent with quantitative findings from the same trips. Importantly however, the analyses also highlight areas that require further investigation, including flight preparation strategies in relation to the uncertainty of in-flight break allocation. There were two strategies for sleep prior to a flight: maximising sleep if pilots were expecting later breaks in the flight; or minimising sleep if they were expecting breaks earlier or at unfavourable times in the circadian cycle. They also provide a broader view of the factors that affect the amount and quality of pilots’ in-flight sleep, about which evidence has previously been largely anecdotal. The study underscores the value of including the views and experience of pilots in fatigue risk management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2042205422?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=8zW1I4j1XbkrrJ6zA5o%2FS5z7B6A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195530"

Similarly, while selected, prospective flight school applicants are tested for the same set of skills. The aim of our study was to assess these core competences in advanced undergraduate medical students from different medical schools.Methods In 2017, 67 medical students (year 5 and 6) from the universities of Hamburg, Oldenburg, and TU Munich, Germany, participated in the verified Group Assessment Performance (GAP)-Test at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Hamburg. All participants were rated by DLR assessment observers with a set of empirically derived behavioural checklists. This lists consisted of 6-point rating scales (1: very low occurrence to 6: very high occurrence) and included the competences leadership, teamwork, stress resistance, communication, awareness, and adherence to procedures. Medical students’ scores were compared with the results of 117 admitted flight school applicants.Results Medical students showed significantly higher scores than admitted flight school applicants for adherence to procedures (p< .001, d = .63) and communication (p< .01, d = .62). They reached significantly lower ratings for teamwork (p< .001, d = .77), stress resistance (p< 0.001, d = .70), and awareness (p< .001, d = 1.31). Students in semester 10 showed significantly (p< .02, d = .58) higher scores in domain awareness compared to the final year students. On average, flight school entrance level was not reached by either group for this domain.Conclusions Advanced medical students’ low results for awareness are alarming as awareness is essential and integrative for clinical reasoning and patient safety. Further studies should elucidate and discuss whether awareness needs to be included in medical student selection or integrated into the curriculum in training units.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2168589842?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=xQubtKp7lQWlebX1E0sn%2BKneuJg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-018-1438-1"

It has been labeled as a major factor in aviation safety worldwide because of its potential disorientation. Hypoxic symptoms have been found at altitudes ranging up to 12,500 ft.; however, federal regulations allow pilots to operate aircrafts at this altitude without the use of supplemental oxygen. Purpose: To determine the effects of 12,500 ft. on physiology, cognition, and performance in pilots during a flight simulation. Methods: Ten healthy male pilots engaged in three visits including a pre-screening visit and two experimental trials. Each of the trials consisted of a 60 minute baseline period, followed by a 60 minute flight simulation period. The first visit included all baseline anthropometric variables and a graded maximum exercise test using a leg cycle ergometer. The two experimental visits included a 0 ft. normoxic trial (NORM) and a 12,500 ft. hypoxic trial (HYP). Physiological data including heart rate (HR), oxygen utilization (VO2), oxygenation, and blood flow was collected. Also cognitive data including running memory (MEMORY) was collected. Finally, pilot performance data including operational errors (OE), command errors (CE) and total errors (TE) were recorded. Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated a significant (p ≤ 0.05) time by condition interaction for HR, oxygenation, blood flow, and MEMORY. A paired samples t-test demonstrated a non-significant (p ≥ 0.05) difference for OE, CE, and TE between trials.

The purpose of this study was to determine if attributes of pilot performance could be used to differentiate students in a collegiate flight training program. Several pre-entry and flight training attributes were examined to see if any served as predictors of success. A general survey was administered to explore why students may or may not have chosen to remain in the flight training program and/or pursue the certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate. Finally, the Tabular Speed Test© was administered to further understand flight student population characteristics as they pertained to existing aviation selection test batteries.The participants in this study were 242 persons attending a Midwestern post-secondary institution who began and completed the private pilot flight course between the spring of 2010 and fall of 2014. Logistic regression results indicated that it was possible to predict student completion of the multi-engine flight course 73.2% of the time (X2 (7) = 23.349, p < .001). Additionally, there were several significant correlations amongst performance variables which warrant future research, such as the relationship between high school GPA to the private, instrument and commercial flight theory courses (r = .307, n= 199, p = .000, r = .367, n= 103, p = .000, and r = .219, n= 84, p = .045, respectively).

Data were analysed using the Pearson correlation and multiple regression techniques.Main findings: High levels of reliability were found for the scales used in this study. Significant correlations were found among POS, organisational commitment and turnover intention. A linear regression analysis indicated that both organisational commitment and POS are significant predictors of turnover intention.Practical/managerial implications: The findings of this study suggest that POS and commitment play a significant role in reducing turnover intention. Employee support programmes should be offered as a panacea for turnover intention given the need for employee retention and commitment in this industry.Contribution/value-add: The aviation industry strives to retain employees, by investing in employees’ training and development.

Background: Identifying variables that predict skilled performance in a complex task aids in understanding the nature of skill and also aids in the selection of operators to perform that task. SA is thought to be an important predictor of performance. SA is often thought to be based on underlying cognitive mechanisms. Method: Three performance measures taken from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Air Traffic Scenarios Test, the low-fidelity simulation component of the FAA's controller selection battery, were used as criterion variables in a hierarchical regression. After predicting performance based on a battery of cognitive (e.g., intelligence, working memory, spatial memory) and noncognitive tests (e.g., cognitive style, personality, demographics), we added measures of SA. Results: SA did provide increases in prediction, but only when measured with the Situation Present Assessment Method, an on-line query method. When the same questions were asked off line, SA did not enter the model in two cases and improved prediction by only 2% in the third. Conclusion: Thus, some measures of SA do show incremental validity, even against a backdrop of a large number of cognitive variables. Application: On-line measures of SA can be a worthwhile addition to standard batteries of tests used to predict performance in cognitively oriented industrial tasks.

However, very few studies have directly examined this memory aid hypothesis. By systematically manipulating how information is available externally versus internally in a sequential number comparison task, three experiments were designed to investigate the relation between external representations and working memory. The experimental results show that when the task requires information from both external representations and working memory, it is the interaction of information from the two sources that determines task performance. In particular, when information from the two sources does not match well, external representations hinder instead of enhance task performance. The study highlights the important role the coordination among different representations plays in distributed cognition. The general relations between external representations and working memory are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1291065968?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=UBhNlyzzb3%2BtqZPZtg10jBYhx4U%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006513"

Our hypothesis is that a large range of strong negative emotional consequences, including those induced by economic pressure, are associated with the decision to revise the flight plan and favor PCE. We investigated the economic hypothesis with a simplified landing task (reproduction of a real aircraft instrument) in which uncertainty and reward were manipulated. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and eye tracking measurements were performed to get objective clues both on the cognitive and emotional state of the volunteers. Results showed that volunteers made more risky decisions under the influence of the financial incentive, in particular when uncertainty was high. Psychophysiological examination showed that HR increased and total HRV decreased in response to the cognitive load generated by the task. In addition, HR also increased in response to the financially motivated condition. Eventually, fixation times increased when uncertainty was high, confirming the difficulty in obtaining/interpreting information from the instrument in this condition. These results support the assumption that risky-decision making observed in pilots can be, at least partially, explained by a shift from cold to hot (emotional) decision-making in response to economic constraints and uncertainty.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","https://www.proquest.com/docview/905008642?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Nikg0qoKD81fd5zB2aG6%2Bdv%2FA1s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10484-011-9163-0"

In this study, we use an ecologically valid multitasking paradigm to test post-error behavior. It was predicted that after failing an initial task, a subject re-presented with that task in conflict with another competing simultaneous task, would more likely miss their response opportunity for the competing task and stay ‘tunneled’ on the initially errored task. Additionally, we predicted that an error’s effect on attention would dissipate after several seconds, making error cascades less likely when subsequent conflict tasks are delayed. A multi-attribute task battery was used to present tasks and collect measures of both post-error and post-correct performance. Results supported both predictions: post-error accuracy on the competing task was lower compared to post-correct accuracy, and error-proportions were higher at shorter delays, dissipating over time. An exploratory analysis also demonstrated that following errors (as opposed to post-correct trials), participants clicked more on the task panel of the initial error regardless of delay; this continued task-engagement provides preliminary support for errors leading to a cognitive tunneling effect.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2879462176?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=p5uKWyYohRQzcZ63zd5eCVa%2BZHw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-023-00512-y"

Air traffic controllers, who provide advisory services to the aircraft in airspace and on the ground, usually face high level of psychological risk factors due to essence of the work.Although psychosocial risk factors among air traffic controllers have been investigated since air traffic control services were born by the first decade of the twentieth century, there is still need for further studies in this field, especially based on type of control service apart from physical working conditions. The main objective of this study is to assess psychosocial risk factors among air traffic controllers to determine the psychosocial work environment constituents which can be improved through administrative implementations. The research methodology followed in the study mainly consists of three phases as: scale development, implementation of the scale, and assessment of psychosocial risk factors. Initially a risk assessment scale predominantly based on the NIOSH Generic Job Stress Questionnaire is developed, then necessary data is gathered through questionnaires and finally exploratory factor analysis of the data was conducted and obtained results were interpreted. In total 230 air traffic controllers working in the Directorate of Air Traffic Control Center, Turkey participated in the study and data analysis was conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Research findings revealed that working conditions of air traffic controllers is a field of study which is quite open to improvement in terms of psychosocial risks. The main novelty of this research study is to make significant contribution towards improving psychosocial working conditions of area controllers through assessment of psychosocial risk factors they are exposed to. Obtained results and recommendations are expected to raise awareness in the sector and help leading new approaches to re-arranging working patterns, thus promoting occupational health and safety of air traffic controllers and aviation safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3132861308?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2FdWdHB1TnDM8fMGk03iw5OxSMeE%3D",""

Drawing on lessons from engineering on improving safety in aviation and the nuclear power industry, the Department of Health has moved from an individual to a system-centred approach. Whereas the traditional investigation generally stopped when human error was identified, the systems approach takes error as a symptom, not a cause, and asks why it happened, and what were the factors operating on the individual that contributed to the negative outcome (Department of Health, 2000).

As a result, mental health issues among health care professionals (HCPs) are on the rise and the prevalence of errors in their daily tasks could increase. Processes of demographic change are partly responsible for even higher stress levels among HCPs. The digitization of patient care is intended to counteract these processes. However, it remains unclear whether these health information systems (HIS) and digital health technologies (DHT) support the HCPs and relieve stress, or if they represent a further burden. The mental construct that describes this burden of technologies is mental workload (MWL). Work in the clinic can be viewed as working in safety-critical environments. Particularly in this sensitive setting, the measurement methods of MWL are relevant, mainly due to their strongly differing levels of intrusiveness and sensitivity. The method of eye tracking could be a useful way to measure MWL directly in the field.Objective: The systematic review aims to address the following questions: (1) In which manner do DHT contribute to the overall MWL of HCPs? (2) Can we observe a direct or indirect effect of DHT on MWL? (3) Which aspects or factors of DHT contribute to an increase in MWL? (4) Which methods/assessments are applied to measure MWL related to HIS/DHT? (5) What role does eye tracking/pupillometry play in the context of measuring MWL? (6) Which outcomes are being assessed via eye tracking?Methods: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, we will conduct a systematic review. Based on the research questions, we define keywords that we then combine in search terms. The review follows the following steps: literature search, article selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, data analysis, and data synthesis.Results: We expect results as well as a finalization of the review in the summer of 2021.Conclusions: This review will evaluate the impact of DHT on the MWL of HCPs.

The Covid-19 pandemic challenged governments at different levels in many countries across the world for over two years to address a variety of public health risks. This also applies to the Netherlands, a densely populated high income country in Europe with approximately 17 million citizens. Experience with previous crises - such as the Bijlmermeer Airplane Disaster in Amsterdam (1992), the Q fever outbreak (2007-2011), the MH17 airplane disaster in Ukraine (2014) and gas-mining induced earthquake problems in the north of the Netherlands (ongoing) - shaped the current Dutch public health response structure and knowledge base, designed to assist local and national authorities to anticipate disaster-related population health risks. During the Covid-19 pandemic this structure was used as a starting point to develop and implement a five-year monitoring program: the integrated GOR-Covid-19 health monitor; GOR stands for “Gezondheidsonderzoek bij rampen” (disaster health research). The main objective of the GOR-Covid-19 monitor is to collect and promote the uptake of reliable and timely monitoring information for the benefit of regional and national public health decision-making in the Netherlands, focusing on the public health impact of the Covid-19 crisis (virus infections and mitigation measures) among children and adolescents, adults and public mental health care, a potentially vulnerable group including homeless and former drug addicts. The monitor is carried out under coordination of the “Network GOR”, comprised of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, GGD GHOR Netherlands (on behalf of the 25 municipal health regions), Nivel, and ARQ National Psychotrauma Centre. The current workshop consists of five presentations by members of Network GOR. The first contribution gives an overview of the research objectives and the outline of the study protocol of the monitoring program. The other contributions focus on particular study components, that are shaped and aligned during the timeline of the monitor. One presenter will share the findings from the first series of systematic literature reviews. Two contributions are based on a combination of surveys in representative samples and an analysis of primary care registry data: one with an emphasis on quarterly results (short-cycle monitoring), the other on (bi-)annual reports, which zoom in on long-term developments and differences between subgroups based on vulnerability factors and geography (long-cycle monitoring). The fifth contribution details the participatory stakeholder-engagement process designed and implemented to promote that monitor findings are used for local and national public health sense-making and decision-making.Key messages• The workshop describes the background and design of a national longitudinal monitoring program to track the public health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands.• An overview is given of the first findings on the health impact of the pandemic for different populations and related vulnerability factors as well as the stakeholder engagement process.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3192343904?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Y56XQW5SVZzIZxCgT%2FEryINnLvc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac129.478"

To explore this triadic relationship, a battery of six distinct scales was employed, including the Chinese Civil Aviation Pilot Occupational Stress Scale, the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), the Flight Performance Scale, the Job Satisfaction Scale, the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ), and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 131 valid questionnaires were collected for analysis, yielding a valid response rate of 65.5%. The findings demonstrate a negative correlation between occupational stress experienced by Chinese civil aviation pilots and their mental health, performance, and job satisfaction. Notably, a positive coping style was identified as a moderator in the relationship between occupational stress and flight performance, effectively mitigating the negative impact of stress on flight performance. Similarly, a negative coping style was found to moderate the relationship between occupational stress and job satisfaction, attenuating the adverse effects of occupational stress on job satisfaction. This study underscores the predictive utility of investigating the occupational stress experienced by pilots for understanding their mental health, performance, and job satisfaction. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for adjusting the negative impact of occupational stress on flight performance and job satisfaction through interventions that target pilots’ coping styles.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2882250529?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Cd8gKtgQXYp4WeoPqpm9nC6G7vo%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace10100896"

Each late stage navy aviator training failure costs the taxpayer over $1,000,000 and ultimately results in decreased operational readiness of the fleet. Currently, potential aviators are selected based on the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), which is a series of multiple-choice tests that evaluate basic and aviation-related knowledge and ability. However, the ASTB does not evaluate a person's response to stress. This is important because operating sophisticated aircraft demands exceptional performance and causes high psychological stress. Some people are more resistant to this type of stress, and consequently better able to cope with the demands of naval aviation, than others.Methodology/Principal Findings Although many psychological studies have examined psychological stress resistance none have taken advantage of the human genome sequence. Here we use high-throughput -omic biology methods and a novel statistical data normalization method to identify plasma proteins associated with human performance under psychological stress. We identified proteins involved in four basic physiological processes: innate immunity, cardiac function, coagulation and plasma lipid physiology.Conclusions/Significance The proteins identified here further elucidate the physiological response to psychological stress and suggest a hypothesis that stress-susceptible pilots may be more prone to shock. This work also provides potential biomarkers for screening humans for capability of superior performance under stress.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1292178720?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3rdkz%2BuA5772SrdkIPLHhgUXlK8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008371"

Stressing factors of aviation and commercial operations can result in pilots’ burnout, which is a description of the response to chronic emotional exhaustion and loss of motivation.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout and compare the effects of different coping strategies on burnout levels among commercial pilots in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2023MethodsThe study was a cross-sectional survey utilizing an online form of a validated questionnaire administered to pilots of Saudi commercial airlines in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study targeted on-duty Saudi commercial pilots, excluding retired and in-training pilots, with an estimated population of around 2000. A sample size of 311 was determined using an equation considering a 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a 60.3% burnout prevalence rate. Non-probability snowball sampling method was used to achieve sample size.ResultsA total of 321 pilots were included, mostly Saudis. The participants had a median age of 47, and the majority were married with one to two children. BMI classifications showed high percentages of overweight and obese individuals. The study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout (70.1%). Nationality, marital status, and shorter sleeping duration were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. Common challenges included long duties (79.4%), irregular working hours (72.3%), and time away from home (55.5%). Coping strategies included rest and sleep (81%), exercise (59.2%), and relaxation behaviors (50.5%). Stressors such as long duties, irregular working hours, and work conflicts were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. However, no significant associations were found between coping strategies and burnout levels.ConclusionThe study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout. In addition, common challenges included long duties, irregular working hours, and time away from home. The study emphasizes the need to address work-related stressors, implement interventions, and support pilots' mental health. Promoting healthy coping strategies and understanding individual resilience is important. Further research and organizational efforts are required to mitigate burnout and enhance the quality of life for aviation professionals, benefiting both individuals and the industry.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2859491910?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=rSWXSTW%2Btb1z%2F29U1Y%2Fl00sPFrM%3D","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.41948"

In the cockpit environment, pilots who fail to properly manage their workload commit more monitoring errors. Given the lack of training and educational programs available to pilots which emphasize improving their monitoring skills, more research is needed to assess the usefulness of types of training that can be used to improve pilots' monitoring. This research project sets out to determine if the potential exists to enhance pilots' monitoring skills through online training. For this study, 40 military helicopter pilots (participants) were divided into two training groups: (1) an online training group, which completed a 20-minute web-based training module, and (2) a control group, which read a 20-minute article on aviation safety. Within each group, the pilots were paired and completed two training events in a flight simulator as part of their normal duties. The effects of the training were evaluated using Kirkpatrick's multi-level framework: reactions, learning, behaviors, and results. First, all pilots receiving training were surveyed to capture the trainees' perceptions of satisfaction and utility of the training. Second, all pilots were given a multiple-choice test to assess the effect the training had on learners' knowledge of the training objectives. Next, the researchers observed, via video recording, both groups' behaviors during flight simulator events. The researchers recorded occurrences of four behavior markers as the crews flew multiple instrument approaches. The researchers used two of these markers to study transfer of training and two markers to examine positive vs. negative outcomes at critical tasks during the simulated flights. The results show positive changes in the reactions, learning, and behavior dimensions, lending support to the effectiveness of relatively inexpensive online training to teach monitoring skills.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1431180799?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=HA42zT9lvXFhFEZeNEKhfiJFrdY%3D",""

"Exploration of British Army Careers. Understanding Army Careers in Context: The Kaleidoscope Career Model","","Carrahar, James William","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2023-01-01","2023","","","","","","9798384197133","ENG","This study explores the concept of careers within the context of the British Army, using the theoretical framework of the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM) and evaluates the use of the model for soldiers’ careers within the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME).Semi-structured interviews with 27 REME soldiers provided the data, which was analysed using thematic analysis. Interview findings demonstrated that soldiers recognise the opportunity for careers in the Army, a traditional organisational career and to be successful soldiers must understand the “rules of the game”.Contributions to knowledge include the exploration of KCM for REME soldier careers, the importance of timing the sequence of moves to align with future aspirations, whilst reflecting the authenticity of service, the need for balance at different career stages and the overarching need to challenge yourself. Army careers are typically within the challenge stage of life, most soldiers leaving do so to achieve balance and stability between work and life. Those who stay recognise the importance of sequencing moves and focusing effort in the “right” places to progress to the next rank.A Doctor of Business Administration (as opposed to a Doctor of Philosophy) aims to have a practical impact, with contributions to practice including raising awareness of the hysteresis of habitus, the challenge of changing the career model, and the associated lag in the widely understood view of career progression and career management. Addressing the lag has the potential to calibrate performance and expectations that allow “exceptional” personnel to promote ahead of traditional timelines. KCM helps Career Management Officers to have informed discussions with personnel, to think through their sequence of moves during routine assignments and on promotion to have a more fulfilling career that aligns with emerging career policy, ensuring people perform rather than hold back from demonstrating their full potential.This research concludes by recognising that careers are context-specific; Army careers and opportunities exist as traditional and hierarchical careers as the Army prepares for the future operating environment. Decisions on the size and shape of the Army continue to be based on the assessment of threats to British interests and the need to prepare for future conflict – a modern and agile Army, focusing on people who are the Army – to deliver capability in different environments. The Army career model is changing in response to the environment and require research to help understand it.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3110361243?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=bNvPyaezi%2FEcdgZSXq7kyYIrDP4%3D",""

Methods: Three exposure groups are distinguished: those living within a radius of 1 km from the disaster (initial n=39), those living between a radius of 1 and 2 km from the disaster (initial n=56), and those living in the rest of the city of Amsterdam (initial n=508). Health measures include general health, health in comparison with age peers, functional limitations, disability and cognitive functioning. These measures are based on self-ratings, interviewer observations, or both. Results: Older persons living closest to the disaster area are likely to experience health decline in the wake of a disaster, over and above the health decline that would occur normally with aging. The disaster-associated health decline is small, and most obvious in the ability to perform actions (such as mobility), but is not observed in either disability in daily functioning, nor in self-perceptions of health. Cognitive functioning even shows a short-term improvement. Conclusion: These findings suggest substantial resilience in older adults, despite their common health problems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/194862303?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=iJhcvSORCtKZlaHldFfRUXLECTI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/cki126"

The ever increasing costs of flight training combined with a predicted shortage of pilots have resulted in steps being taken to improve flight training efficiency. In the past, the majority of airline pilots received their flight training in the military. Over time a growing portion of airline aviators have been educated in collegiate programs. Efficiency is paramount in collegiate aviation in order to control costs and assure that flight training is completed before graduation. Today collegiate programs cannot factor in training effectiveness when pricing services or setting instructor compensation. The problem is that the relationship between instructor experience characteristics and training efficiency, as measured by student completion times, in part-141 collegiate aviation programs is unknown. This quantitative study involved analysis of secondary data in the form of 83,942 flight training records covering 1031 students enrolled in a collegiate aviation program in Dubuque, Iowa, who were taught by 100 flight instructors during a seven-year period. A series of regressions was performed relating private pilot, instrument rating, commercial pilot, and multi-engine rating student completion times to dual instruction given, months of tenure, employment status, instructor level, and total flight hours. An equation relating instrument completion time to total flight time and months of tenure was found to explain 16.89% of completion time (p-value of 9.97x10-06). Commercial pilot completion times were found to have a relationship with dual given, months tenure, total time, and instructor level with respective R-squared values of 0.04778, 0.043843, 0.040508, and 0.03992, and p-values of 0.01600, 0.02117, 0.02685, and 0.02800. An equation relating commercial completion times to dual given and months tenure was found to explain 7.477% of completion time (p-value of 0.0102). An equation relating multi-engine rating completion times to total time and dual given was found to explain 8.641% of completion time (p-value of 0.01651). Total flight time was found to be the strongest overall predictor of teaching effectiveness. Future research involving other universities with different demographics, climate, and training methods was recommended to determine the extent to which these results can be applied to other programs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1100974454?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=qy2aAVnaCb6rAtP%2BCDceSlGMsBs%3D",""

This heralded the arrival of three-way inter-service competition and the RAF faced successive assaults on its independence post-war. Many scholarly works have focused on the doctrinal and economic arguments made by the RAF’s leadership in its defence. The significance of the RAF’s lack of history in the context of the period and how the ‘Whitehall Warriors’ at the Air Ministry harnessed that to their advantage remains unexplored.This gap will be addressed by critically evaluating the intentions and actions of the Air Ministry’s senior leaders in order to interrogate their political understanding of the significance of creating and promoting a distinctive RAF culture. The RAF’s novelty, it will be argued, predisposed the Ministry to use the subtler arts of influence, political lobbying, and the promotion of the young service to the public. Meanwhile, escalating inter-service competition encouraged the Air Ministry to take a politically aggressive attitude to its rivals.This thesis will analyse the tensions between tradition and modernity, characteristic of the era and central to the Air Ministry’s challenge. It will investigate the Ministry itself: its status, relations with the establishment and the press, and the networks it used to further the RAF’s cause. A framework of identity, space, time, and power will be used as a methodology for understanding how the RAF created a resilient culture, underpinned by strong foundations and operational experience. This thesis reassesses inter-service rivalry, arguing that virulent attacks on the RAF aided its transition from a fledgling force to a secure one.

"Soft Target Security: Environmental design and the deterrence of terrorist attacks on soft targets in aviation transportation","","Jashari, Linda","Homeland Security Affairs","Scholarly Journals","","","","2018-03-01","Mar 2018","n/a","","","1558643X","","","ENG","Terrorist attacks on soft targets at airports have increased in the last decade. The events of September 11, 2001 exposed deep vulnerabilities in the security of the aviation sector. As a result, the U.S. government enacted concrete policies and procedures to prevent future airline hijackings and to deter prohibited items from entering aircraft. However, since 2011, 14 airport attacks have occurred worldwide.[1] The increase in attacks at airports demonstrates that adversaries are continuously seeking new targets in the aviation sector. At the same time, a general increase in air travel has led to larger crowds at airports. An attack on soft targets in the airport environment could cause a significant disruption of the aviation industry, leading to a large negative effect on the U.S. economy, not to mention the social and psychological health of this nation’s citizens.An examination of several airports reveals that ticket counters, baggage claim areas, and screening checkpoint queues are easily accessible to adversaries seeking to harm this country. Such areas are open to the general public, including nefarious actors engaged in pre-surveillance to establish a plan of attack. Presently, people have minimal physical protection in these publicly accessible areas. Furthermore, the United States does not have a systematic national policy approach in place for airport soft target security (STS). The purpose of this thesis is to explore how policy approaches and environmental design countermeasures can be applied to the problem of soft target protection in airports. The overarching goal is to mitigate the threat to crowds, minimize the impact of an attack, and disrupt the terrorist planning process.The recent increase of airport attacks across the globe and the limited literature for explicitly protecting crowds in the airport environment provide the impetus for this research. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) does not specifically mandate the protection of public spaces within the airport environment. The death of 32 civilians during the terrorist attack at Brussels International Airport, for example, illustrates the vulnerability of crowds in these spaces. However, empirical research in the criminology field, such as crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED), offers proven methods that may be transferred to the airport construct. Based on this framework, this research explores methods of deterring adversaries, disrupting the terrorist planning cycle, and prescribing proven environmental counter-measures to mitigate an attack on soft targets in airports.The research design and solution included three case studies of terrorist attacks on soft targets in airports: Brussels in 2017, Los Angeles in 2013, and Glasgow in 2007. These cases were chosen because they were deliberate attacks on soft targets in airports. The Brussels case involved the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) hidden in luggage and detonated by terrorists in the interior public terminal. The Los Angeles case involved the use of an assault rifle by an active shooter on both the non-sterile and sterile area, and the Glasgow case involved the use of a vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) to attack a public terminal.Human perception of target selection, airport configuration, attack consequences on security, the economy, and implications of airport design were analyzed. The data sources derived from literature, agency reports, airport records, and configuration diagrams. The analysis criteria included airport terminal layouts, infrastructure materials, and event documentation. The mode of analysis included attack location, method, and impact. The independent variable was the airport environmental design and the dependent variable was human attack perception. The United States and European Union (EU) soft target counter-terrorism strategies were also compared and analyzed.Aviation transportation is critical to the lives of Americans and the global economy. Aviation alone accounts for more than 5% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) contributing over $1.6 trillion to the total market economy.[2] An airport attack could result in a loss of $17 billion in GDP from lost air travel.[3] As demonstrated by the case studies, airport attacks disrupt the aviation system network and cause cascading effects. The attacks cost airports and airlines millions of dollars in lost airline revenues, business continuity operations, emergency response, infrastructure damage/renovation, crowd management, injuries, and deaths. The attacks also impact both the local and national economy. In Brussels for example, the attack cost the Belgian economy an estimated four billion euros.[4] To evolve with the emerging threat, a national systematic approach is needed to address the protection of crowds in the airport environment.In the case of Brussels where terrorist used improvised explosives, the materials used throughout the interior directly added to the human casualty rate. People were injured by building debris, glass windows, and interior ceiling panels fragmented by the explosives’ shock wave. In the Glasgow case, the terrorist’s attempt to detonate the explosives by setting a fire resulted in damage to the exterior and interior building that caused extensive smoke in the interior building, and water damage from automatic sprinkler systems. In Los Angeles, the spontaneous evacuation of over 4,500 people, the confinement of an addition 20,000 people in the terminals, and the impact to 1,500 flights, resulted in a significant disruption of airport operations.This research revealed that alternative methods for airport environmental design exist and can be used effectively to mitigate risk. Airport authorities and government officials made some significant changes to protect soft targets and improved airport infrastructure in the aftermath of the attacks. For example, at Brussels and Glasgow airports, passenger pick-up and drop-off zones were moved outside the perimeter of the terminal building. Additionally, blast mitigation materials replaced glass fixtures. Turnstiles have been added to the entrance of security screening checkpoints and baggage claim areas as extra layers of access control security. Additionally at Glasgow airport, 300 steel bollards and automatic number plate recognizers (ANPR) were installed. Los Angeles airport is continuing to develop environmental counter-measures, and plans are underway to add security desks in the public terminal areas.This thesis makes several recommendations to implement airport environmental counter-measures that will improve STS, specifically in airline ticketing queues, screening checkpoint queues, and baggage claim areas. These spaces are critical pinch-points that concentrate soft targets into high density targets of opportunity. The recommendations include applying the CPTED principles of defensible space (territoriality, surveillance, maintenance, and access control) by using the design concepts of organized, mechanical, and natural features. These concepts include altering the adversaries’ human reactional elements and perception of targets. Modifying temperature, pressure, lighting, sound, and creating optical illusions can achieve these measures. Placing camouflage elements, such as fabric netting, mirrors, indoor planters, and water features, provide deterrence and deception in perception capabilities of crowds. Additionally, adding sound absorbing materials decreases the noise level and makes the crowd appear smaller while simultaneously calming the users of the space.In the airline ticketing area, crowd congestion can be minimized and distributed by increasing the use of technology. For example, technology developed to have passenger pre-pay for weighing and checking in luggage (pre-airport arrival) can significantly decrease airline check-in queues. Establishing multiple drop-off zones for luggage dispersed throughout the airport grounds further reduces crowd formations. Additionally, bomb-sniffing canines should be actively utilized in these areas to detect explosives and provide a deterrence effect. Shrapnel and fragmentation resistant materials should be utilized throughout these areas to mitigate the risk from IED explosions.In the screening checkpoint queue, distributed versus centralized queue concepts offer enhanced threat reduction at minimal cost. Distributed queuing also decreases the number of individuals per square foot, which makes the crowd appear smaller. Blocking the view of the queuing line with large planters, artwork panels, or frosted blast-resistant glass can further deter the adversary from conducting pre-surveillance or seeing the “big picture.” Additionally, the use of lighting, such as in theater production, can alter the perception of the line.Similar features can also be integrated in the baggage claim areas to obstruct the view of attackers and provide mitigation elements to protect people. In the event of an IED explosion or active shooter, these materials can improve shock and projectile absorption. The placement of closed circuit televisions (CCTVs), explosive-detection canines, and additional police patrols in these areas add additional layers of security. Lastly, placing the baggage claim in an inaccessible area to the public, or installing turnstiles to limit access, decreases the risk of opportunistic attacks.This thesis also recommends the utilization of risk assessment models, physical structures and technology, robotics, and simulation models to evaluate and enhance security measures properly in the non-sterile airport domain. Independent risk assessment groups, such as the UK’s model of the Risk Advisory Group (RAG) and Security Executive Group (SEG), can provide subject matter expertise to assess attack methodology through a game theory model. The deliberative method for ranking risks is also a great tool to calculate the number of lives lost per event. Physical blast-resistant technology, such as Kalwall windowpanes, offer effective alternatives for airport glass re-placement because they are shatterproof, fire-retardant, lightweight, and aesthetically appealing. Portable bulletproof and blast-resistant curtains, such as origami Kevlar shields, deliver an adaptable method to the evolving threat, are flexible, lightweight, and can be transported. Robots, such as Knightscope, offer the ability to augment physical security techniques because they have advanced detection sensors, such as audio and visual recognition, thermal imaging, license plate recognition, weapon detection, emergency alert alarms, and can transmit pre-recorded announcements, which are effective for crowd management. Computerized simulation models provide a great alternative to attack scenario planning and minimize costs needed to assess and implement physical security counter-measures. The Multi-Agent System, for example, is effectively used for emergency management and evacuation simulations. The Anti-Terror Risk Infrastructure Protection Model (ATRiM) also offers an analysis of operational and physical risk vulnerabilities in infrastructure.Policies, such as UK’s Countering Terrorism (CONTEST), which place crowd protection in the fore of government planning and risk mitigation strategies, offer best practices to emulate. In the United States, the Transportation Security Administration has made significant strides in risk-based security. Over the years, it has updated policies to detect and deter threats, deployed explosive detection canine handlers and visible intermodal prevention and response teams, and liaised with the international aviation community to enhance aviation transportation security. Ultimately, however, it is up to airport operators and the airline industry to protect the masses in the airport critical infrastructure. The challenge still remains of how to protect soft targets collectively.Establishing policies and environmental counter-measures to be people-centric provides this opportunity. The environmental elements of CPTED provide strategic methods for crowd-protection and can fill the gap of physically securing the soft targets. If applied strategically, these features can minimize threat impact, afford resiliency, and boost continuity of operations. A systematic approach to STS can save billions of dollars for the aviation industry, airport infrastructure, commerce, and the U.S. economy. As passenger numbers continue to increase in airports worldwide, it is imperative to take a proactive stance to mitigate the risk of attacks on innocent civilians.[1] “Recent Airport Attacks at a Glance,” Associated Press, June 29, 2016, https://apnews.com/4950118 bb7e944c6b3bc8045b39bd24e.

Because air disasters may cause substantial losses, comprehensive surveys of the psychophysiological mechanism of flying are needed; however, relatively few studies have focused on pilots. The default mode network (DMN) is an important intrinsic connectivity network involved in a range of functions related to flying. This study aimed to examine functional properties of the DMN in pilots. Method: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 26 pilots and 24 controls were collected. Independent component analysis, a data-driven approach, was combined with functional connectivity analysis to investigate functional properties of the DMN in pilots. Results: The pilot group exhibited increased functional integration in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and left middle occipital gyrus. Subsequent functional connectivity analysis identified enhanced functional connection between the precuneus/PCC and medial superior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: The pilot group exhibited increased functional connections within the DMN.

"Investigating Neural Sensorimotor Mechanisms Underlying Flight Expertise in Pilots: Preliminary Data From an EEG Study","","Sestito, Mariateresa; Harel, Assaf; Nador, Jeff; Flach, John","Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","Scholarly Journals","","","","2018-12-13","Dec 13, 2018","n/a","","","16625161","","","ENG","Over the last decade, the efforts towards unraveling the complex interplay between the brain, body, and environment have set a promising line of research that utilizes neuroscience to study human performance in natural work contexts such as aviation. Thus, a new discipline called neuroergonomics is holding the promise of studying the neural mechanisms underlying human performance in pursuit of both theoretical and practical insights. In this work, we utilized a neuroergonomic approach by combining insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition to study flight expertise. Specifically, we focused on the Mirror Neuron system as a key correlate for understanding the interaction between an individual and the environment, suggesting that it can be used to index changes in the coupling of perception-action associated with skill development.In this study, we measured the EEG mu suppression as a proxy of the Mirror Neuron system in experts (pilots) and novices while performing a distance estimation task in a landing scenario. To survey the specificity of this measure, we considered central, parietal and occipital electrode pools and analyzed alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-25 Hz) rhythm bands. We hypothesized that in experts vs. novices, specific neural sensorimotor brain activity would underpin the connection between perception and action in an in-flight context. Preliminary results indicate that alpha and beta suppression was area-specific irrespective of groups, present in the central electrodes placed over the motor areas. Group analysis revealed that specifically alpha mu rhythm, but not beta, was significantly more suppressed in pilots vs. novices. Complementing these findings we found a trend in which the strength of mu suppression increased with the sense of presence experienced by the pilots. Such sensorimotor activation is in line with the idea that for a pilot, a distance judgment is intimately associated with the function of landing. This reflects the ability to use optical invariants to see the world in terms of the capabilities of the aircraft (e.g., reachability and glide angle).These preliminary findings support the role of embodied simulation mechanisms in visual perception and add important insights into a practical understanding of flight expertise, suggesting sensorimotor mechanisms as potential neuro-markers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2285258236?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=AMQUwDWf9sXbQ5kY%2BtVzrKVSoCE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00489"

Os sistemas multi-equipa operam frequentemente em ambientes extremos e imprevisíveis, que requerem treino especializado e elevados níveis de coesão. O efeito do treino sobre a coesão, ao nível dos multi-sistemas, é uma área de investigação que tem recebido pouca atenção. A presente investigação pretende colmatar esta lacuna ao investigar a variação nos níveis de coesão social e de tarefa afectada por tipo de treino, e na presença de um estímulo espontâneo indutor de stress. Para tal criou-se um desenho experimental 2x2 inter-sujeitos. Pediu-se aos participantes que imaginassem um cenário fictício onde fizessem parte de uma de duas equipas. Estas equipas estariam envolvidas num projecto de investigação. As condições foram manipuladas de modo a que ambas as equipas treinassem em conjunto, ou separadamente. Também foi manipulada uma situação de crise indutora de stress. Durante o projecto de investigação poderia ocorrer uma crise que afectaria a multiequipa, ou poderia não ocorrer. Seguidamente, os participantes tinham que responder a um questionário que media coesão social e de tarefa. Verificou-se um maior nível de coesão de tarefa para treino conjunto do que para treino separado. Esta diferença não foi verificada para coesão social.

The current study sought to conduct the first systematic literature review and meta-analysis aimed at determining suicide risk across the diverse, high pressure and male-dominated transport industry (commercial aviation, merchant seafaring, transit/driving) as compared to the general/employed population. Methods Searches of PubMed/Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were conducted without date restriction until March 2021.

The final included sample consisted of 23 articles (16 used for meta-analysis). Results from the meta-analysis indicated that transport workers had a significantly elevated risk for suicide as compared to the general/employed population. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses, and there was some variation across subgroup analyses. Conclusions Overall, we found transport workers had a significantly higher risk for suicide than the general/ employed population, and this appeared to be driven by the association for those working in merchant seafaring/ maritime occupations.

A high fidelity simulation of an instrument flight pattern produced multiple workload levels resulting in various levels of performance. Psychophysiological parameters including eye movements, EEG, and peripheral temperature were measured. Workload was varied and a secondary task was added to create realistic operational performance levels. Four groups of four subjects provided 64 data segments each during two, 2 hour simulation periods. Eight subjects were instrument rated and eight unrated. Eight subjects had commercial flight experience and eight had no commercial flight experience. Operationally relevant performance levels were based upon Air Traffic Control (ATC) and safety standards. Subjects' performance error was dangerous for 18 of 1024 segments and exceeded ATC standards on additional 193 segments. The Long Fixation parameter was sensitive enough to predict 83% of segments exceeding ATC performance error standards with a 15% false alarm rate. Factors of workload, attentiveness, and cognitive processing capability affect performance; different psychophysiological parameters are needed to completely describe performance. Level of arousal reflected the “level of attention” for perception, processing, and response execution. The two best arousal parameters, Peripheral Temperature Change and Pupil Diameter Change, were the best performance predictors, these parameters reflected performance decrements related to workload and other stressors. Performance decrements associated with nominal or low workloads were not detected. Saccade Time, Dual Fixation Gate, and seven other parameters related to task type showed great promise in providing real time feedback on workload levels and the type of task on which operators are engaged. Elements of cognitive performance were described by the Long Fixation and Short Fixation parameters. A high frequency of Long Fixations was indicative of problem solving activity. A high frequency of Short Fixations was indicative of efficient processing. However, the efficiency was not related to only to workload since subjects used large numbers of short fixations when monitoring the simulation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304457972?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=H6t0u6x8X4HvV1HwgJNQCeYA1VQ%3D",""

Background: Many studies attempt to predict accident rates using measures of work unit safety, but effects vary considerably. Conversely, this study examined whether recent accidents may be positively associated with work unit safety perceptions, as suggested by behavioral learning mechanisms (increases in safety investments following accidents) or cognitive mechanisms (defensive attributions regarding accident causality). Method: Lagged squadron-level accident experience was correlated with work unit safety perceptions obtained through a 61-question safety climate survey administered to 6,361 individuals in U.S. Navy flight squadrons. Results: Positive associations between minor or intermediately severe accidents and future safety climate scores were found, although no effect was found for major accidents. Conclusion: We suggest that accident history should be considered when examining work unit safety perceptions because recent accidents may be associated with higher safety climate scores. We did not find that this varies systematically with accident severity, and longitudinal research on additional samples is needed to further test this possibility. Application: This research may be used to refine measurement of work unit safety and to examine impacts of accidents or safety violations on workers' cognitive processes and group behavioral changes.

This paper addresses three questions: What indicators of problem-solving skill are available in paper-and-pencil solutions, beyond a simple accuracy measure? Can these indicators distinguish between problem solvers in terms of their skill level? How can these indicators be used to improve the effectiveness of instructor feedback to problem-solving exercises? Based on the published literature on cognition and problem solving, several indicators were hypothesized to signal knowledge and skill: an accurate free-body diagram, specification of assumptions, accurate expansion of key principles, strategic (forward) inferences, and checking equations and solutions. A mixed experimental methodology was applied that combined qualitative and quantitative analyses. The qualitative data was comprised of paper-and-pencil solutions and video recordings of participants while they solved problems. Frequency counts of skill indicators and grader-assigned scores comprised the quantitative data. Statistical tests confirmed that the hypothesized indicators were associated with individuals' level of skill. However, reliable evidence for these indicators was only partially found in the paper-and-pencil solutions and could only be firmly established by including data from the video recordings. The results show that paper-and-pencil solutions can be diagnostic of the strengths and weaknesses of problem-solvers. However, to provide useful and reliable feedback to students, these solutions must be supplemented with additional input, possibly through regular structured sampling throughout a course, or through more extensive use of computer resources.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/889963748?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=dvf83MF0TqaCKYgqU7PRscIatZU%3D",""

Each participant performed 40 approaches to the runway. During 8 of the approaches, the point of view that the flight simulator used to compute the visual scene was slowly raised or lowered with 4 cm with respect to the cockpit, hence moving the projection of the visible part of the cockpit down or up in the visible scene in a hardly noticeable manner. The increases and decreases in the simulated eye height led to increases and decreases in the altitude of the approach trajectories, for all three groups of participants.

"Exploring Human Error Variations, Mental Health, and Aviation Accidents: A Qualitative Case Study","","Bentley, John","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2019-01-01","2019","","","","","","9781392437919","ENG","The researcher posited that the aviation community is negligent in its oversight responsibility to vet, train, and sustain mentally fit and competent pilots throughout the entirety of their respective lifecycles. At the moment, the aviation industry fails to conduct initial-entry pilot aptitude, emotional condition, or mental health screenings for new and experienced aircrews. The industry-wide pilot shortage, coupled with a lack of Federal Aviation Administration mental health oversight, is seen as an existential threat to the flying public and our nation’s homeland security (Higgins et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016). The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine select individual nonfatal aviation accidents that occurred and if the pilot’s mental health experienced a paradigm shift as a result. Additionally, the researcher explored remedial measures to reduce human errors by implementing a pilot selection process through a mental health vetting process. The researcher also explored methods to remove stigmatizing barriers that prevent pilots from disclosing mental health issues with their respective Aeromedical Examiners. The purposive sample recruited participants through a locally operated pilot union (approximately 225-instructor pilots and an additional 175-unrepresented pilots) via email, as well as LinkedIn social media posts. Only seven respondents (n =7) from email and LinkedIn social media posts met the eligibility requirements outlined in the participation invitation. The study’s findings indicated that the participants experienced instances of depression. This finding is significant because it highlights the prevalence of mental health challenges facing the aviation industry. Based on study results and participant responses, the FAA should act to improve fundamentals-of-instruction (FOI) standards to include utilizing role-reversal techniques in flight instructor training.

These programs depend on voluntary participation of and reporting by air carrier pilots to be successful. The purpose of the study was to develop and validate a measurement scale to measure U.S. air carrier pilots' perceived benefits and/or barriers to participating in ASAP and LOSA programs. Data from these surveys could be used to make changes to or correct pilot misperceptions of these programs to improve participation and the flow of data. ASAP and LOSA a priori models were developed based on previous research in aviation and healthcare. Sixty thousand ASAP and LOSA paper surveys were sent to 60,000 current U.S. air carrier pilots selected at random from an FAA database of pilot certificates. Two thousand usable ASAP and 1,970 usable LOSA surveys were returned and analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Analysis of the data using confirmatory actor analysis and model generation resulted in a five factor ASAP model (Ease of use, Value, Improve, Trust and Risk) and a five factor LOSA model (Value, Improve, Program Trust, Risk and Management Trust). ASAP and LOSA data were not normally distributed, so bootstrapping was used. While both final models exhibited acceptable fit with approximate fit indices, the exact fit hypothesis and the Bollen-Stine p value indicated possible model mis-specification for both ASAP and LOSA models.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1564772167?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=K5lcJtIhX%2FGWgvk0bsmo4tsLk4Y%3D",""
"Impact of Spatial Orientation Ability on Air Traffic Conflict Detection in a Simulated Free Route Airspace Environment","","Zhong, Jimmy Y; Goh, Sim Kuan; Woo, Chuan Jie; Alam, Sameer","Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","Scholarly Journals","","","","2022-04-08","Apr 8, 2022","n/a","","","16625161","","","ENG","In the selection of job candidates who have the mental ability to become professional ATCOs, psychometric testing has been a ubiquitous activity in the ATM domain. To contribute to psychometric research in the ATM domain, we investigated the extent to which spatial orientation ability (SOA), as conceptualized in the spatial cognition and navigation literature, predicted air traffic conflict detection performance in a simulated free route airspace (FRA) environment. The implementation of free route airspace (FRA) over the past few years, notably in Europe, have facilitated air traffic services by giving greater flexibility to aviation operators in planning and choosing preferred air routes that can lead to quicker arrivals. FRA offers enhanced system safety and efficiency, but these benefits can be outweighed by the introduction of air traffic conflicts that are geometrically more complex. Such conflicts can arise from increased number and distribution of conflict points, as well as from elevated uncertainty in aircraft maneuvering (for instance, during heading changes). Overall, these issues will make conflict detection more challenging for air traffic controllers (ATCOs). Consequently, there is a need to select ATCOs with suitably high levels of spatial orientation ability (SOA) to ensure flight safety under FRA implementation. In this study, we tested 20 participants who are eligible for ATCO job application, and found that response time-based performance on a newly developed, open access, computerized spatial orientation test (SOT) predicted time to loss of minimum separation (tLMS) performance on an air traffic conflict detection task (AD-CDT) we designed. We found this predictive relationship to be significant to a moderately large extent under scenarios with high air traffic density (raw regression coefficient = 0.58). Moreover, we demonstrated our AT-CDT as a valid test in terms of eliciting well-known mental workload and spatial learning effects. We explained these findings in light of similar or overlapping mental processes that were most likely activated optimally under task conditions featuring approximately equal numbers of outcome-relevant stimuli. We conclude by discussing the further application of the SOT to the selection of prospective ATCOs who can demonstrate high levels of conflict detection performance in FRA during training simulations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2648319589?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=y%2FCAoi7VYqA2CWhCMmKNISHSWFk%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.739866"

The ego controls the id's desires because they may have consequences or not be socially acceptable. A person experiences defense mechanisms to protect his or her ego. Although psychologists view defense mechanisms as a typically healthy way to deal with a problem, the aviation industry sees them as dangers to the safety of flights. Many aircraft accidents have occurred because the pilot had a strong ego, and was unconsciously defending it. Crew members must learn to recognize defense mechanisms in themselves and in their crew. Once recognized, an antidote should be applied. Usually, following prescribed procedures by the Federal Aviation Administration or the airline can help counter the effects of a strong ego.

"A comparison of the effectiveness of a personal computer -based aircraft training device and a flight training device at improving pilot instrument proficiency: A case study in leading regulatory change in aviation education","","McDermott, Jon T.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2005-01-01","2005","","","","","","978-0-542-38116-4","ENG","Aviation educators have long sought economical and effective ways to simulate how an aircraft flies. In particular, there has always been an interest in simulating the procedures and practices of operating an aircraft in instrument flight conditions, when no horizon is visible. Because the costs of flying aircraft continue to increase, there has been an interest in adopting the technology of the microcomputer to bring realistic flight simulation at lower costs to the general aviation market.  The introduction of the personal computer-based aircraft training device, or PCATD, in the late 1990s stimulated the academic investigation of this technology for use in collegiate aviation education activities. Initially Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulators dismissed this technology as gaming software and hardware, but the successful use of PCATD technology for training general aviation pilots as shown by academic studies convinced the FAA in 1997 (AC 61-126) to approve the use of PCATDs as an equivalency to actual flight time, but for only a portion of that equivalency allowed for FAA approved FTDs.  This study, a comparison of the effectiveness of a PCATD with that of an FAA approved FTD for maintaining an instrument pilot's ILS proficiency, is another effort to stimulate FAA acceptance of this new technology as an effective and economical way to provide valid simulated learning activities to the general aviation community.   Specifically, this study found that there was no significant statistical difference between using the PCATD or the FAA approved FTD for maintaining an instrument pilot's ILS proficiency. This study also found that there was no statistical significant difference in either device's effectiveness at maintaining an instrument pilot's proficiency. The process of regulatory change in any bureaucracy is a time-consuming process. As Kocks (2005) wrote, the FAA adapts change on the same pace that mountains form. However, the challenge of new simulation technology, in this study the PCATD, will not abate, and aviation educators and regulators should accept it as an effective means by which the general aviation pilot community can maintain, and improve, the safety of its instrument flight practices.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/305028534?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=I5ZFlmksqAFpvodqUgTFBMUoiMM%3D",""

FAA compliance action letters obtained by FOIA for American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines were examined to identify errors and causal elements for categorization and further study. Delta Air Lines letters were requested but not provided by the FAA. Participants were randomly selected from FAA listings of certificated mechanics and asked to complete a survey. Quantitative data was acquired from 48 participants that met selection criteria and completed the survey. Qualitative data was acquired from interviews conducted with nine of the survey participants. Using the categories developed from the FAA data, the study found common errors with the completion of maintenance entries, handling of maintenance documents, content of maintenance instructions, installation of parts, deviations from maintenance procedures, and maintenance steps or tasks that were overlooked or not performed. Dominant causal factors were identified as failure to follow instructions or procedural requirements, and maintenance and process instructions that contain inaccurate information or lacked sufficient detail. The dominate human factors identified in the study were complacency and lack of attention. Study participants noted that complacency was primarily responsible for failure to follow instructions. Performance of repetitive or simple tasks was a causal factor that drove complacency. Direct or indirect demands on mechanics to quickly return aircraft to service also contributed to the performance of maintenance without the use of instructions. Significant corrective actions taken by air carriers included the imposition of controls to prevent the release of flight plans for aircraft that have overdue inspection items, improvements to allow for greater access to maintenance manuals, and a program for the review of instructions by maintenance personnel prior to publication. Suggested corrective actions include automation of manual processes used to track recurring inspections, improved drafting of instructions with mechanic involvement, improved training of new mechanics to instill good habits and providing maintenance instructions through the use of personal electronic devices.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2550253924?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=yQr8j2Zf1HsaFDBlWgdx7wk%2FMfk%3D",""

In particular, I develop and apply an information-theoretic approach to situation management in aviation security.This thesis investigates the factors affecting situation management and addresses the challenges of establishing timely situation awareness to support the ‘course of action’ selection. In order to efficiently manage an aviation security incident, a situation management approach can provide the required technological capability in this dynamic and complex environment.Situation management research is still in its infancy and more research concerning underlying methodologies and techniques is required. This work therefore models situation management as a collaborative information problem and explores the factors from a macro-perspective modelling the problem as a multi-agent system.The goal of the research is to explore and develop an information-theoretic framework for decision support systems in situation management contexts. This thesis presents the approach to design and develop a situation management framework within the aviation security context. The modelling work and experiments were implemented with an agent-based simulation software tool (Repast version 2.0). The framework and its implementation has been validated based on use case studies. The performance of the proposed agent model in comparison to two recent European live trial scenarios has been tested to emulate real-time constraints and requirements.The results obtained indicate that automation support for time-critical decision-making in aviation security supports the early identification of incidents and increases the situational awareness during the management of an incident. This allows decision-makers to select from a wider range of options, as the time-window for the deployment of responses increases. Next to the validation of the concept and framework developed, an initial situation management capability for aviation security in SESAR is defined.The work reported in this thesis demonstrates that the situation management concept and framework is applicable for multi-agency coordination and collaboration in aviation security incident management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3236849643?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=sTZPMvL6%2Fq7FkkWrywjv1iDVKVY%3D",""

An exploratory case study involving an aerospace assembly line was conducted to gain insights into the model developed.

Attitude and consciousness evaluate cross-cultural psychology, and knowledge and skills evaluate cross-cultural behavior. Under the 4 first-level indicators, there are 6 second-level indicators and 17 third-level indicators. This paper uses the accuracy and convenience of language operators in the process of information conversion to transform fuzzy subjective qualitative analysis into quantitative analysis, and proposes a set of evaluation methods for cross-cultural competence based on language operators. At the same time, an empirical study was conducted with C University as an example. The statistical results show that the method has good applicability and scientificity for the evaluation of the cross-cultural competence of civil aviation college students.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3191243786?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=uRpALNAlPgDP1meIqWcboZfMT0s%3D","https://doi.org/10.2478/amns.2021.2.00030"

Automated environment features make it particularly prone to increase mind wandering frequency. Through mechanisms like complacency or agency, automating a task could increase mind wandering frequency for the operator. For safety-critical industries, the lower perception and degraded stimuli processing associated with mind wandering, summarized by the term “decoupling hypothesis”, are particularly concerning. 16 participants supervised an autopilot avoiding obstacles with two levels of reliability. Each condition lasted 45 minutes. We recorded thoughts as either pertaining to being focused, task-related mind wandering or task-unrelated mind wandering. We also recorded perceived mental demand, trust regarding the autopilot and oculometric measures. Based on questionnaire results, our protocol succeeded in inducing more mental demand and lower trust when the automation was unreliable. Attentional states were not correlated, nor did it influence trust in the system reliability. On the contrary, mental demand ratings and pupil diameter were lower during both task-related and task-unrelated mind wandering, compared to those during the focus attentional state. This shows that perceptual decoupling also affects the engagement of operators in automated environments, which may dramatically lower their ability to supervise automation efficiently. This research informs human-automation designers to consider operator engagement when creating automated systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2285276831?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Q1WqL6AHxVx5XO7b%2B%2BI54FhaFYY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00383"

One hundred and forty-eight community residents were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). The results showed that age differences were not affected by impact of disaster (IES), suggesting that elderly and younger community residents responded to the disasters similarly. Instead, the community residents exposed to the aircraft crash experienced significantly more intrusion and avoidance than those exposed to the train collision. Also, the community residents who had experienced high exposure to the disasters had significantly more intrusive thoughts and exhibited significantly more avoidance behavior than the low/medium exposure group. The results also showed no main effects in general health between the elderly and younger community residents, suggesting that their health status was similar. Instead, the community residents exposed to the aircraft crash had significantly more general health problems than the train disaster residents and the control group.

General similarities and differences in ground-level and aerial encoding have been identified, but little is known about the specific characteristics that differentiate them. One such characteristic is the need to process orientation; ground-level encoding (and navigation) typically requires dynamic orientations, whereas aerial encoding (and map reading) is typically conducted in a fixed orientation. The present study investigated how this factor affected spatial processing by comparing ground-level and aerial encoding to a hybrid condition: aerial-with-turns. Experiment 1 demonstrated that scene recognition was sensitive to both perspective (ground-level or aerial) and orientation (dynamic or fixed). Experiment 2 investigated brain activation during encoding, revealing regions that were preferentially activated perspective as in previous studies (Shelton and Gabrieli in J Neurosci 22:2711-2717, 2002), but also identifying regions that were preferentially activated as a function of the presence or absence of turns. Together, these results differentiated the behavioral and brain consequences attributable to changes in orientation from those attributable to other characteristics of ground-level and aerial perspectives, providing leverage on how orientation information is processed in everyday spatial learning.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/236167853?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2FFMl1SUeyvmgetrfQXfAJuCkWvo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-006-0088-9"

Review: Numerous empirical studies over the past 50 years have demonstrated the increasing negative impact of aircraft noise on residents worldwide. However, extensive database searches have revealed no published studies on psychological interventions that reduce residents' reactivity to environmental noise. By contrast, there has been extensive research over several decades confirming the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction training in lowering people's stress from work and life. Considering that stress is a major component of aircraft noise reaction, it would seem worth assessing whether mindfulness-based interventions might be effective in reducing the health effects of aircraft noise. It appears that no existing conceptualization of mindfulness specifically accounts for noise as a stressor. Conceptual Analysis: A new conceptual model is presented here which explains how mindfulness can reduce noise reactivity. Two types of mindfulness are distinguished: an active form (meta-mindfulness) and a passive form (supra-mindfulness). It is posited that meta-mindfulness can facilitate ""cognitive defusion"" which research has confirmed as enabling people to disconnect from their own dysfunctional thoughts. In the case of aircraft noise, negative thinking associated with residents' reactive experiences can exacerbate the health effects they suffer. The present model further proposes that supra-mindfulness can enable an individual to disengage their own sense of identity from the often overwhelming negative thoughts which can define their existence when they are consumed by extreme noise annoyance. Conclusion: The mindfulness processes of defusion and disidentification are postulated to be the key efficacy mechanisms potentially responsible for reducing reactivity to aircraft noise. This approach can be evaluated by extending previous research on the health benefits of mindfulness training.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1936184772?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Dr9hxOOEEruiANQn%2FCpKN5MOPjU%3D","https://doi.org/10.4103/nah.NAH_106_16"

According to the Big Five Inventory, this capacity can be modulated by two important personality traits: conscientiousness and neuroticism. The former would be related to concentration skills and the latter to the attention bias towards anxiety-provoking stimuli. Given the current development of monitoring systems for detecting the users’ state, which can be incorporated into cockpits, it is desirable to estimate their robustness to inter-individual personality differences. Indeed, several emotion recognition methods are based on physiological responses that can be modulated by specific personality profiles. The personality traits of twenty pilots were assessed. Afterwards, they performed two consecutive simulated flights without and with induced social stress while electrodermal activity was measured. Their subjective anxiety was assessed before the second flight, prior to the stress-induced condition. The results showed that higher scores in neuroticism correlated positively with cognitive and somatic anxiety. Moreover, under social stress, higher scores in conscientiousness correlated positively with electrodermal stability, i.e., a lower number of skin conductance responses. These results on both self-reported and physiological responses are in favor of the integration of personality differences into pilots’ state monitoring.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2544532017?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ql9nqg6gSaDVm0ZonSqBUbfO3xU%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/safety7020049"

Previous research suggests that children are a high risk group vulnerable to the effects of chronic noise exposure. However, questions remain about the nature of the noise effects and the underlying causal mechanisms. This study addresses the effects of aircraft noise exposure on children around London Heathrow airport, in terms of stress responses, mental health and cognitive performance. The research also focuses on the underlying causal mechanisms contributing to the cognitive effects and potential confounding factors.Methods. The cognitive performance and health of 340 children aged 8-11 years attending four schools in high aircraft noise areas (16h outdoor Leq>66dBA) was compared with children attending four matched control schools exposed to lower levels of aircraft noise (16h outdoor Leq<57dBA). Mental health and cognitive tests were group administered to the children in the schools. Salivary cortisol was measured in a subsample of children.Results. Chronic aircraft noise exposure was associated with higher levels of noise annoyance and poorer reading comprehension measured by standardized scales with adjustments for age, deprivation and main language spoken. Chronic aircraft noise was not associated with mental health problems and raised cortisol secretion. The association between aircraft noise exposure and reading comprehension could not be accounted for by the mediating role of annoyance, confounding by social class, deprivation, main language or acute noise exposure.Conclusions.These results suggest that chronic aircraft noise exposure is associated with impaired reading comprehension and high levels of noise annoyance but not mental health problems in children.

Numerous aviation accidents have occurred when a shallow GP was induced by a black hole illusion (BHI) or featureless terrain environment during night visual approaches to landing. Identifying the landing surface's orientation as well as size, distance, and depth cues are critical for a safe approach to landing. Twenty pilots accomplished simulated approaches while exposed to manipulated visual cues of horizon, runway length/width (ratio), random terrain objects, and approach lighting system (ALS) configurations. Participants were assessed on their performance relative to a 3 degree GP in terms of precision, bias, and stability in both degrees and altitude deviation over a distance of 5 nm (9.3 km) assessed at equal intervals to landing. Runway ratio and distance from the runway were the most dominant aspects of the visual scene that differentiated pilot performance and mediated other visual cues. The horizon was most influential for the first two-thirds of the approach and random terrain objects influenced the final portion. An ALS commonly used at airports today, mediated by a high runway ratio, induced shallow GPs; however, the worst GP performance regardless of ratio, was a combination ALS consisting of both side and approach lights. Pilot performance suggested a three-phase perceptual process, Assess-Act-React, used by pilots as they accumulated visual cues to guide their behavior. Perceptual learning demonstrated that despite recognition of the BH approach, pilots confidently flew dangerously low but did improve with practice implying that visual spatial disorientation education and training would be effective if accomplished in flight simulators.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304896493?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=z5GXvGhMQ4zP%2FGijMaTuNFnCqYA%3D",""

Other incidents may also have a mental health component that is related to, but not the direct cause of, the event. It is suspected that these “other incidents” are much more commonplace and while not catastrophic, erode safety. Depression and anxiety are two commonly occurring mental health concerns. Research indicates that a considerable portion of the U. S. population suffers from some form of mental health issue. Most go undiagnosed and untreated. A similar rate of occurrence appears to be found within the airline pilot population. The stigma of mental health may lead many to not seek treatment. This may be especially true for pilots who face the potential loss of their medical certificate or complications in maintaining medical certification. As a result of discussions regarding pilot mental health, the FAA is now providing enhanced mental health screening guidance to designated aviation medical examiners. Additionally, employers and labor organizations are being encouraged to implement and improve pilot assistance programs better suited to helping pilots who may be suffering from mental health issues. The availability and effectiveness of these programs varies. Ultimately, removing the stigma of mental health in the greater population and improving the understanding of mental health within the aviation medical community may be necessary to encourage more pilots who have mental health concerns to seek treatment. This approach would have the most significant effect on aviation safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2424158170?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=nxGGKAIghavqaScGygh7eFvfMv0%3D",""

The answer then for older adults and their ability to learn advanced and changing technologies must lie deeper than just the loss of cognitive abilities as one ages. The research question for the study was, ""What is the experience of older pilots in training who are transitioning to technically advanced aircraft?” The study employed grounded theory using seven participants answering guided interview questions. The population was pilots who fly for a volunteer organization within the state of New York. Out of a population of 52 pilots, seven participated whose ages were between 40-80 years and went through transition training from basic aircraft cockpits to computerized G1000 models. Data analysis began with guided interview questions along with coding and memoing. The first stage of analysis was the initial coding process, then focus coding, axial coding, and finally theoretical coding. Theoretical coding generated a theory, which pointed to self-efficacy.

L.","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2017-01-01","2017","","","","","","9798297942295","ENG","Background: Violations occur when individuals choose to bypass or deviate from procedures. Although violations are often not intended to cause harm, they are nevertheless breaches of the preferred way of working. Violations have been suggested to introduce risk into the environment by eroding the margin of safety. Therefore, violations are of potential concern to healthcare professionals that are responsible for patient safety. This thesis examines how and why violations occur in community pharmacies. Method: The research adopted a mixed methods approach to explore violations in community pharmacies and three studies were undertaken. The first study was a qualitative study that explored the views of management and frontline staff with regards to the prevailing safety culture in community pharmacies. The aim was to understand the context in which violations occur and to explore the goals that staff manage in practice. The second interview study explored how procedures are perceived in practice and the types of violations that occur in this setting. The third study utilised a survey based on the COM-B model that further explored the influence of capability, opportunity and motivation on violating behaviours. Results: Overall, findings demonstrated that numerous types of violations occur in community pharmacies. Mainly they occur either to ensure that timely patient care is provided or to ensure that productivity is maintained in practice. The safety culture study suggested that frontline staff and management have a different safety culture, with frontline staff reacting to risk in the moment and head office staff managing risk through the provision of multiple detailed procedures. The interviews suggested that procedures are useful for outlining what is expected of staff in practice; however they are not always possible to follow to the letter due to the complex working environment. The social norm within each pharmacy was suggested to influence violating behaviours, as was the professional judgement of the pharmacist. Violations were shown to be necessary for maintaining care at times, especially in exceptional circumstances. However, at times violations to maintain productivity did result in an increased risk to patient safety. The questionnaire study highlighted motivation, opportunity, length of experience, staff role and gender as influences on certain types of violations. Conclusions: The mixed methods utilised as part of this thesis revealed the types of violations that occur in community pharmacies and the reasons why pharmacists and support staff choose to violate. The findings led to recommendations for policymakers to evaluate how procedures are implemented in practice, to provide additional support for staff in practice through improved workflow, to provide patient safety specific training in pharmacies, to improve communication between frontline and head office staff and to educate pharmacy students regarding the possibility that they will need to violate procedures at times to manage the complex reality of working within community pharmacies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3266300694?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ZEdQmCUP995PS8Ulmkvg9mbuOwY%3D",""

Differences of statistical significance were also found between the MAST (Anxiety State and Tension Scale) parameters and R (number of sun spots) and SolFlux (radio solar flux), respectively. TDS (test of ability to differentiate cues) as well as the PAMATB (memory performance test) have significantly higher values for high speed of hot and sparse plasma of solar wind. TDS correlates with the geomagnetic activity level and with R. K-test (visual coordination test) shows better results when geomagnetic activity and energetic proton flux are higher (PrFl>1). We are aware that the correlation found between some parameters of space weather, health and mental state cannot be considered as causal because the primary cause of the mechanism is not clearly understood.

This study examined the impact of maternal participation in a public health nurse (PHN)-delivered group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention on infant ER. Mothers/birthing parents were ≥ 18 years old with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score ≥ 10, and infants were < 12 months. Between 2017 and 2020, 141 mother–infant dyads were randomized to experimental or control groups. Infant ER was measured at baseline (T1) and nine weeks later (T2) using two neurophysiological measures (frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV)), and informant-report of infant temperament. Mothers were a mean of 30.8 years old (SD = 4.7), 92.3% were married/ common-law, and infants were a mean of 5.4 months old (SD = 2.9) and 52.1% were male. A statistically significant group-by-time interaction was found to predict change in HF-HRV between T1 and T2 (F(1,68.3) = 4.04, p = .04), but no significant interaction predicted change in FAA or temperament. Results suggest that PHN-delivered group CBT for PPD may lead to adaptive changes in a neurophysiological marker of infant ER, highlighting the importance of early maternal intervention.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3166179388?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=DzUwH40wQCVcgxkibI7MucGPZP8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579423001566"

Focus groups were recorded; the recordings were transcribed and later coded using thematic analysis, which took an inductive, iterative, narrative approach.Results: Airport firefighters face unique challenges, and operational stressors are overshadowed by organizational stressors. Additionally, peer support is an integral aspect of coping with both organizational stressors and critical incidents. Firefighters were found to have positive attitudes toward mental health treatment in general, but several barriers still remain, such as stigma, fear of being placed on leave and fear of confidentiality breach.Conclusion: Specialized treatment options for public safety personnel and airport firefighters who engage in serious incidents outside of their regular duties are needed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3128891568?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=g5ATTbAY8cfR4pTLKCvoBiOlPC8%3D","https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.43.10/11.03"

The questionnaire records the respondent’s seniority, flight time, and flight characteristics. We assessed workplace psychosocial hazards with the Chinese version of the Job Content Questionnaire (C-JCQ). Mental health conditions were measured with the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5), sleep status with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and burnout with the Chinese version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (C-CBI). Fatigue symptoms on duty were also recorded. The correlation between workplace psychosocial hazards and health effects were analyzed by the regression model.Results160 pilots had filled out the questionnaire, with an average age of 40, ten years of work experience, and an average flight time of 753.3 hours per year. The standardized scores for work demand and work control were 57.8 and 54.7, respectively, higher than the national norm. 28.76% of pilots had emotional distress. Daytime sleepiness was observed among 23.13% of pilots. 25.63% of pilots had work-related burnout with moderate or higher severity. High work demand, low work control, and numbers of red-eye flights were predictors of emotional distress and work-related burnout, and the average flight time is also significantly positively correlated with work-related burnout.ConclusionCharacteristics of active work with high work demand and high work control were observed in national civil aviation pilots.

Despite their best efforts, software engineers experience human errors, which manifest as software defects. While some defects are simple bugs, others can be costly security vulnerabilities. Practices such as defect tracking and vulnerability disclosure help software engineers reflect on the outcomes of their human errors (i.e. software failures), and even the faults that led to those failures, but not the underlying human behaviors. While human error theory from psychology research has been studied and applied to medical, industrial, and aviation accidents, researchers are only beginning to systematically reflect on software engineers’ human errors. Some software engineering research has used human error theories from psychology to help developers identify and organize their human errors (mistakes) during requirements engineering activities, but developers need an improved and systematic way to reflect on their human errors during other phases of software development. The goal of this dissertation is to help software engineers confront and reflect on their human errors by creating a process to document, organize, and analyze human errors. To that end, our research comprises three phases: (1) systematization (i.e. identification and taxonomization) of software engineers’ human errors from literature and development artifacts into a Taxonomy of Human Errors in Software Engineering (T.H.E.S.E.), (2) evaluation and refinement of T.H.E.S.E. based on software engineers’ perceptions and natural language insights, and (3) creation of a human error informed micro post-mortem process and the Human Error Reflection Engine (H.E.R.E.), a proof-of-concept GitHub workflow facilitating human error reflection. In demonstrating the utility of T.H.E.S.E. and our micro post-mortem process, the software development community will be closer to inculcating the wisdom of historical developer human errors, enabling them to engineer higher quality and more secure software.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2899532737?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=0ShrYXI4YQRT5eRkvvyNEmSytZw%3D",""

Previous field studies have indicated that children's cognitive performance is impaired by chronic aircraft noise exposure. However, these studies have not been of sufficient size to account adequately for the role of confounding factors. The objective of this study was to test whether cognitive impairments and stress responses (catecholamines, cortisol and perceived stress) are attributable to aircraft noise exposure after adjustment for school and individual level confounding factors and to examine whether children exposed to high levels of social disadvantage are at greater risk of noise effects.Methods. The cognitive performance and health of 451 children aged 8-11 years, attending 10 schools in high aircraft noise areas (16 h outdoor Leq > 63 dBA) was compared with children attending 10 matched control schools exposed to lower levels of aircraft noise (16 h outdoor Leq < 57 dBA).Results. Noise exposure was associated with impaired reading on difficult items and raised annoyance, after adjustment for age, main language spoken and household deprivation. There was no variation in the size of the noise effects in vulnerable subgroups of children. High levels of noise exposure were not associated with impairments in mean reading score, memory and attention or stress responses. Aircraft noise was weakly associated with hyperactivity and psychological morbidity.Conclusions. Chronic noise exposure is associated with raised noise annoyance in children. The cognitive results indicate that chronic aircraft noise exposure does not always lead to generalized cognitive effects but, rather, more selective cognitive impairments on difficult cognitive tests in children.

However, research literature has indicated that faculty and researchers have themselves conducted plagiarism at alarming rates. Further, there appears to be a large amount of research that has been recycled through egregious self-plagiarism. As aviation research becomes increasingly important to the field of study, it is critical that such research is of high quality, legitimate, and original. This descriptive study investigated the prevalence of plagiarism in aviation research published in five prominent, peer-reviewed research journals (Collegiate Aviation Review, Journal of Air Transportation, International Journal of Applied Aviation Studies, International Journal of Aviation Psychology and Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine). From each of these journals, 30 articles (n = 150) were uploaded to Turnitin plagiarism detection software for analysis. The mean similarity index of the articles was found to be 16.01% (SD = 18.12). A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a statistically significant difference in similarity indices across the five journals, x2 (4, n = 150) = 9.785, p = .044 with the International Journal of Applied Aviation Studies and the International Journal of Aviation Psychology having the highest levels of plagiarism. Within the 150 journal articles, 68 cases (45.3%) met the minimum level of plagiarism (similarity index > 10% as advocated in the literature). Overall, 102 (68%) articles contained instances of self-plagiarism (overlap with material written by an article author without citation). Sham-type (exact text but improperly cited) plagiarism was evident in 88 (59%) of articles and 78 (52%) contained at least one instance of verbatim-type (exact text without citation) plagiarism. Plagiarism appears to be a concern for aviation research stakeholders and it is evident that there is a need for more guidelines and oversight by journal editors and reviewers. Suggestions for future research are provided.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1687646597?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=eG0mcUDPX0cjHhAo4ZyGIJbXHLA%3D",""

The authors of this paper focus on people employed in the aviation sector, who work in the hard-to-cope environment of full automation, demanding working conditions and numerous stressors. The presented study fills a gap in the research on the psychological characteristics of the aviation sector. Moreover, a sense of stress/threat is described in the context of the high specificity of employees representing the 4.0 sector. Therefore, it provides additional insights into the psychological functioning of the employees in the aviation sector. The results show that both positive orientation and ego resilience might be seen as protective factors against a sense of threat and stress, while a type D personality is a risk factor of a higher level of those psychological states.

Although the posttest data from this study revealed negative changes in student ethical behavior, the study revealed a significant positive difference in students' ethical beliefs indicating that ethics courses were successful in helping the students conceptualize ethical beliefs. Furthermore, the results indicated that students' ethical behavior had deteriorated. It is possible to suggest that this deterioration was caused by increased student understanding of ethical behavior, which caused them to report these unethical behaviors more accurately on the posttest survey. Students' ethical beliefs made the strongest unique contribution in predicting student pilots' affinity to abide by FARs. The second strongest unique contribution was normalization of deviance.

Considering the crucial role that cognitive abilities play in the realm of aircraft piloting, it is imperative to probe into the potential repercussions of depressive symptoms on executive functions (EFs) among this professional cohort.Objectives: This study aims to explore the associations between depressive symptoms and EFs in a convenience sample of airline pilots.Methods: Male airline pilots (n = 100) underwent the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) to gauge both the presence and intensity of depressive symptoms. The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT), the Digit Span Task (DST), and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used to assess EFs.Results: Of the entire sample of pilots, 88% (n = 88) demonstrated minimal depressive symptoms with a BDI-II score ranging from 0 to 13. The remaining 12% (n = 12) exhibited mild depression, with scores between 14 and 19. Pilots suffering from mild depression demonstrated prolonged color and word times and a higher time interference (TI) score on the SCWT. Moreover, these individuals exhibited lower scores on the DST across both the forward digit span (FDS) and backward digit span (BDS) subtests. Finally, the presence of mild depression correlated with an increased number of total errors, encompassing both perseverative and non-perseverative errors, in the WCST. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, we found an independent association between BDI-II scores and total errors in the WCST.Conclusion: Our research points to substantial differences in EFs between airline pilots demonstrating mild depression and those exhibiting minimal depressive symptoms.

"COVID-19 Outbreak in Colombia: An Analysis of Its Impacts on Transport Systems","","Arellana, Julian; Márquez, Luis; Cantillo, Victor","Journal of Advanced Transportation","Scholarly Journals","","2020","","2020-01-01","2020","","","","0197-6729","2042-3195","","ENG","The global COVID-19 outbreak has demanded drastic actions and policies from the governments and local authorities to stem the spread of the virus. Most of the measures involve behavioural changes from citizens to reduce their social contact to a minimum. Thus, these actions influence individual activity patterns and transport systems in different ways. This paper studies the short-term impacts on the transport system caused by the different policies adopted by the Colombian government and local authorities to contain the COVID-19 spread. Using official and secondary data concerning the seven most populated cities in Colombia, we analyse the impacts on three components of the transport system: air transport, freight transport, and urban transport. Results show that national policies and local decisions have decreased the demand for motorised trips across the cities, diminishing congestion levels, reducing transit ridership, and creating a reduction in transport externalities. The country banned air transport for passengers and only allowed air cargo for medical and necessary supplies, which will have negative consequences for the economics of the airline industry. During the first three months of the COVID-19, freight was the most resilient transport component. However, freight trips diminished around 38%, affecting mainly the supply chain of nonessential products. During the pandemic, governments need to provide subsidies to maintain the system supply to avoid crowdedness and promote active transport by allocating less-used street space to cyclists and pedestrians. In the short term, transportation service providers will face a financial crisis, deepened by the pandemic, which will require government assistance for their recovery.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2436348979?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3jHkuG75OKdgqBABcntP16uE90U%3D","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8867316"

It suggests two sets of variables related to learning: learning style composition and group process. Composition was measured with Kolb's (1999) Learning Style Inventory Version 3. Group processes measured include efficacy, psychological safety, satisfaction, conflict resolution, identity, cohesion, and agreement. Results of a study of 62 short term project groups are reported. Groups were engaged in a time constrained ill-structured problem-solving exercise based on a modified version of King and Kitchener's (1994) model of reflective judgement and critical thinking. Thematic analysis of group written responses yields a three level model of integrative complexity that serves as a proxy measure for learning and provides a qualitative, short answer questionnaire to measure integrative complexity in groups. Results of statistical analyses support that learning results from a combination of the learning style composition and group process. Data show that integrative complexity in groups is related to the individual learning style composition of groups and to shared perceptions of the group. Learning style composition and the shared perceptions of the group related to learning account for as much as 46% of the variance in integrative complexity. Learning style is most related to the difference in moving from level 1 to level 2 integrative complexity, and shared perceptions are most related to moving from level 2 to level 3. Further, while certain shared perceptions are common to integrative complexity in all groups, learning style composition of a group is related to the unique shared perceptions that emerge in groups faced with a time-constrained, ill-structured problem-solving task. Factor analysis on the LSI show support for a two factor solution and support factor analysis of ipsitive measures.

"A Computational Approach to Situation Awareness and Mental Models in Aviation","","Mamessier, Sebastien","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2013-01-01","2013","","","","","","9798263364267","ENG","1.1 MotivationAlthough most modern, highly-computerized flight decks are known to be robust to small disturbances and failures, humans still play a crucial role in advanced decision making in off-nominal situations, and accidents still occur because of poor human-automation interaction. In complex safety critical human integrated systems, loss of control or automation surprises often trace their origin to disparities between the human agent’s mental representation of a system and the actual states/dynamics of the system and its environment. In addition to the physical state of the environment, operators now have to extend their awareness to the state of the automation itself which supposes an active monitoring action. To guarantee the accuracy of this knowledge, humans need to know the dynamics or approximate versions of the dynamics that rule the automation. A general insight about Newton’s laws and good monitoring skills are no longer sufficient to guarantee completely safe behaviors of such systems involving complex automation-human interactions. Comprehensive and detailed training about automated flight systems is also not sufficient since an excessive complexity might still lead the pilot to misunderstand the automation’s behavior.The operator’s situation awareness can decline because of a deficient mental model of the aircraft and an excessive workload. A local absence of knowledge or some confusion due to too much complexity can be responsible for a faulty mental model.Excessive workload can be caused by the operator’s attempt to understand the automation’s complex behavior in off-nominal situations or by a poorly designed partition of tasks. Generally, automated systems and related training programs should be analyzed in the light of their impact on the operator’s mental model and situation awareness.Usual mechanisms to investigate the influence of new automation on human automation interaction includes extensive use of simulation and human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimentation. But HITL experiments are expensive, time-consuming and consequently can only evaluate a limited set of scenarios. Therefore we need to improve our simulation capabilities by developing realistic, computational human agent models that account for human limitations.This work describes the creation of a computational human agent model simulating the cognitive constructs of situation awareness and mental models known to capture the symptoms of poor human-automation interaction and provide insight into more comprehensive metrics supporting the validation of automated systems in aviation.1.2 RequirementsConcepts of mental models and situation awareness are broad and ill-defined in the literature. To address a computational approach, this work will need to clearly define and scope the terminology. As situation awareness and mental models will be modeled and implemented to support the simulation of HAI as comprehensively as possible, the operational definition of these concepts will project theoretical notions onto a set of computational objects. The implementation should allow the analysis of aviation incidents such as the crash of the flight AF 447 which gives important examples of poor human-automation interaction, excessive workload, lacunary mental models and resulting low situation awareness. Such a case study can therefore be used to provide a list of requirements, scope concepts and define objectives about what needs to be included in the computational agent model. The accident report of the Bureau dEtudes des Accidents (BEA) mentions the unusually high workload throughout the document.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3276842241?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2F760a%2BGHRnnLL9u%2B0NnKEKW%2F380%3D",""

While traveling to space becomes increasingly feasible as the technology advances, there is relatively few research communicates what people can experience about leisure travel in space. Understanding the leisure properties of space travel could potentially help the business development of space tourism. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to explore the following: When people travel to outer space, what properties of leisure experiences attached to orbital space tourism could potentially attract tourists? In this study, leisure perception serves as the theoretical foundation; the theory of a multi-phase experience provides an analytical tool to construct the experience of space tourism. A netnographic research method is applied to obtain authentic descriptions about space travel experience from the most popular Tweets posted by 36 NASA astronauts in Twitter.  The selected 3,468 Tweets indicate that the public shows interests in both in-space and off-site experiences. Moreover, research findings highlight the trip to space as a dynamic and multi-phasic experience with its context. Specifically, the identified key patterns, including training, liftoff, in-space, reentry, and memory, are formed into five stages of orbital space travel. Each stage has its unforgettable experiences and unique leisure attributes. This study hopes to fill the gap in current academic literatures of space tourism, and lay the foundation for formulating marketing strategies for space tourism business. Therefore, people do not have to be fully competent as professional astronauts to desire space travel in the future. Instead, a space tourist as amateur astronaut can expect her space trip with multi-phasic leisure experiences as the ride of a lifetime.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2112358806?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=guw8rqtoFvUjqZO7ppYMZTFU8DY%3D",""

Thirty-two participants, half native English speakers and half native German speakers completed four recognition (cued) recall tasks presented in English under four different audio conditions, all in the presence of simulated aircraft noise. The results of the research indicated that in simulated aircraft noise at 65 dB(A), performance of nonnative English speakers was poorer than for native English speakers. The beneficial effects of noise cancelling headphones in improving the signal to noise ratio led to an improved performance for nonnative speakers.

"A Preliminary Study on Passive and Active Flutter Suppression Concepts for Aeronautical Components","","Paulo, Luís António Dias","PQDT - Global","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2009-01-01","2009","","","","","","9798480607277","ENG","The scope of this work is to study computationally both passive and active flutter suppression characteristics of a cantilever cork agglomerate core sandwich with CFRP facings and an aluminum plate, the latter through the application of piezoelectric patches, respectively. Recently, cork agglomerates have been gaining an increasing interest from the aerospace industry due to their good thermal and acoustic insulation capabilities. In addition, cork based materials intrinsically have excellent vibration suppression properties, which suggest that the combination of cork with high performance composites (such as CFRPs) may lead to high specific strength materials with improved damping characteristics suitable for flutter prevention.Sandwich specimens were modeled using commercially available software ANSYS® and a demo version of ZAERO® software for the determination of the flutter speed and related frequencies. ANSYS® piezoelectric modeling and transient analysis capabilities were used for the active vibration study. Specimen aspect ratio and thickness were chosen as a function of wind tunnel maximum speed for further experimental tests. Results were compared with conventional CFRP and aluminum plates.It was demonstrated that a cork agglomerate core sandwich with CFRP facings can act as a natural flutter suppresser which allows the reduction of the wing weight for a given flight envelope and that the application of piezoelectric actuators is a valuable aeroelastic control concept. An increase of about 20% in flutter speed was achieved using actuated piezoelectric devices. The main goal remains in investigating higher strain smart materials and control strategies, since these improvements are only possible in small structures.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2583030125?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=CrgcEAuuDJpY8QktLE9JWpedq4M%3D",""

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of HA exposure on cognitive functions in healthy subjects. A structural overview of the applied neuropsychological tests was provided with a classification of superordinate cognitive domains. A literature search was performed using PubMed up to October 2021 according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria included a healthy human cohort exposed to altitude in the field (at minimum 2440 m [8000 ft]) or in a hypoxic environment in a laboratory, and an assessment of cognitive domains. The literature search identified 52 studies (29 of these were field studies; altitude range: 2440 m–8848 m [8000–29,029 ft]). Researchers applied 112 different neuropsychological tests. Attentional capacity, concentration, and executive functions were the most frequently studied. In the laboratory, the ratio of altitude-induced impairments (64.7%) was twice as high compared to results showing no change or improved results (35.3%), but altitudes studied were similar in the chamber compared to field studies. In the field, the opposite results were found (66.4 % no change or improvements, 33.6% impairments). Since better acclimatization can be assumed in the field studies, the findings support the hypothesis that sufficient acclimatization has beneficial effects on cognitive functions at HA. However, it also becomes apparent that research in this area would benefit most if a consensus could be reached on a standardized framework of freely available neurocognitive tests.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756674216?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2FWd0ta7CBKAVjHGP1s9ScEGAuaM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12121736"

Severe accidents with associated fatalities are a small number that tend to decrease over time. Human errors, although with all the mitigations over time, are still the most significant cause of accidents; although accidents have decreased, other factors may be related to this type of error, such as the lack of personnel for the operation of a flight. Accidents can also be related to other factors, such as economic factors. GDP growth is positively correlated with accidents, and inflation is negatively correlated.

Studies have amassed considerable evidence related to individual and contextual influences to explain why members of organizations often choose to withhold rather than speak up to superiors. An emerging stream of research has shown that employee silence may stem from self-protective implicit voice theories (IVTs): taken-for-granted rules of self-censorship (Detert & Edmondson, 2011). Building on prior research, this study investigated IVTs, individual power distance orientation, problem-solving self-efficacy, and creative self-efficacy as predictors of leader-directed voice using data collected from 1,032 employees (individual contributors: n = 696; supervisors:  n = 336) in an investment firm. This study also tested problem-solving and creative self-efficacy as moderators of the relationships between IVTs and individual power distance orientation with leader-directed voice. All hypotheses were tested with supervisor-reported voice as the dependent variable and compared in post-hoc tests with self-reported voice as the criterion. Two tests using supervisor-reported voice were significant: the don’t embarrass the boss in public IVT was a significant predictor of voice beyond the controls, and the interaction effect of the need solid data or solutions to speak up IVT with creative self-efficacy was significant, though it masked a pattern of amplified negative impact antithetical to the hypothesized nature of moderation. Post-hoc analyses using self-reported voice as the criterion variable revealed that the composite IVTs scale, all individual IVTs apart from the don’t embarrass the boss in public IVT, problem-solving self-efficacy, and creative self-efficacy were significant predictors of voice beyond the control set.

The aim of this modelling study is to evaluate the potential effects of a single-pilot’s incapacitation on a future design approach to RCO. Most solutions propose a ground support of the pilot by a remote operator whom control should be handed over in case of an emergency. Both incapacitation and homicide-suicide have been discussed in the literature but neither of these events have been modelled nor evaluated empirically. We introduce a future operational design concept for RCO which includes a remote-copilot as ground support and automation tools monitoring pilot’s health and entries into aircraft systems. The hazard analysis technique System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was used to model and analyse scenarios of incapacitation/homicide-suicide. A hierarchical control structure showed how RCO can be embedded into commercial aviation. The STPA of pilot incapacitation and two scenarios of pilot homicide-suicide showed how unsafe control actions leading to an incident or accident after incapacitation/homicide-suicide could be prevented. The possible detection and take-over of control by the ground support in the case of incapacitation raised the question for detailed procedures on how to react to its detection. Either an autoland by the remote-copilot or by an affiliated system is possible. An additional breakup of data-link may only be solved by an automatic landing system on-board.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2932977998?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=dAaqey3I5C0e5D8jcYgGRXKoj6o%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42454-019-00001-y"

In our study, we aimed to characterize the health profile of cabin crew relative to the U.S. general population.Methods In 2014–2015, we surveyed participants of the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study. We compared the prevalence of their health conditions to a contemporaneous cohort in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013–2014) using age-weighted standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs). We also analyzed associations between job tenure and selected health outcomes, using logistic regression and adjusting for potential confounders.Results Compared to the NHANES population (n = 2729), flight attendants (n = 5366) had a higher prevalence of female reproductive cancers (SPR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.18–2.33), cancers at all sites (SPR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.73–2.67 among females), as well as sleep disorders, fatigue, and depression, with SPRs ranging between 1.98 and 5.57 depending on gender and the specific condition examined. In contrast, we observed a decreased prevalence of cardiac and respiratory outcomes among flight crew relative to NHANES. Health conditions that increased with longer job tenure were sleep disorders, anxiety/depression, alcohol abuse, any cancer, peripheral artery disease, sinusitis, foot surgery, infertility, and several perinatal outcomes.Conclusions We observed higher rates of specific adverse health outcomes in U.S. flight attendants compared to the general population, as well as associations between longer tenure and health conditions, which should be interpreted in light of recall bias and a cross-sectional design.

At the same time, advancements in the understanding of human physiology have begun to make their way into flight and duty time regulations and airline scheduling practices. In this complex and ever changing operating environment, there remains an essential need to better understand how these developments, and other daily realities facing commercial airline pilots, are affecting their fatigue management strategies as they go about their rituals of getting to and from their homes to work and performing their flight assignments. Indeed, the need for commercial airline pilots to have access to better and more effective fatigue mitigation tools to combat fatigue and insure that they are well rested and at the top of their game when flying long-range international route segments has never been greater.This study examined to what extent the maximum fatigue states prior to napping, as self-accessed by commercial airline pilots flying international route segments, were affected by a number of other common flight assignment related factors. The study also examined to what extent the availability of scheduled en-route rest opportunities, in an onboard crew rest facility, affected the usage of en-route napping as a fatigue mitigation strategy, and to what extent the duration of such naps affected the perceived benefits of such naps as self-accessed by commercial airline pilots flying international route segments. The study utilized an online survey tool to collect data on crew position, prior flight segments flown in the same duty period, augmentation, commuting, pre-flight rest obtained in the previous 24 hour period, fatigue state at report time, circadian rhythm disruptions, assigned rest periods in an onboard crew rest facility, experiencing spontaneous sleep episodes, and napping metrics. The study also reports on some common en-route fatigue mitigation strategy themes, as reported by the study participants and how these relate to the survey question responses of survey participants. Study results suggest that there are significant relationships between fatigue states prior to napping and augmentation, fatigue states when reporting for duty, assignment to en-route rest in an onboard crew rest facility, and having experienced spontaneous sleep episodes. The study results also suggest that there is not a significant relationship between being assigned scheduled rest periods in an onboard crew rest facility and the usage of en-route napping as part of an individual pilot’s fatigue mitigation stategy. Finally, the study results suggest that short duration naps, averaging less than 30 minutes, are most commonly being employed by the subject population to beneficial effect.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1862012687?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=MkDb9nhlhY4FFPJhmyU1qTdhmik%3D",""

From Amazon's ongoing testing of a UAS delivery service to Uber's recently proposed vertical take-off and landing transportation network, the commercial possibilities are ever growing. To begin expediting the deployment of this emerging technology, in October 2017 the Trump administration issued a memorandum to the secretary of transportation directing the establishment of a UAS-integration pilot program (White House 2017). Although this is a notable step toward integrating and operationalizing UAS commercial operations in the national airspace, the privacy implications of this technology remain a pressing concern in many quarters. UAS privacy issues are often framed in the context of government surveillance and potential First and Fourth Amendment violations. The implications for nongovernmental private-sector data collection, however, have received less attention. An ""invasion"" of privacy is heavily contextual, based on who is doing the surveilling, how it is carried out, for what purpose, and where it is conducted. For the discussion that follows, the who is specifically siloed to commercial service providers. The government's breach of an individual's privacy is subject to any number of statutory restrictions on law enforcement and intelligence agencies, not least of which include the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and is far more clearly legally delineated. The how, what, and where of commercial ""surveillance,"" however, are much less clear, especially in the context of UAS operations. For the purposes of this paper, the focus on ""surveillance"" is specifically constrained to commercial UAS data-collection operations and nongovernmental surveillance that does not implicate constitutional considerations under the Fourth Amendment. I begin by discussing more general issues of privacy in the digital age as well as the domestic legal and regulatory structure that governs privacy. Then I examine these issues as they currently relate to UAS data collection for commercial purposes as well as the current debate over acquiring consent. The paper concludes by looking at all of these issues in the context of a hypothetical future use scenario for commercial UAS data collection and argues that technology specific regulations would be an ill-advised means of responding to potential privacy challenges.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2334333088?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=UHEt1Q80rglw0NUzOA5jRh6%2B2vg%3D",""

Aviators must deal with emergency situations by performing the necessary actions in an established sequence. Many are necessarily performed from memory. A previous study on aviator EP proficiency found that without active practice of the conventionally-learned textual procedures, recall ability decays significantly over a relatively short period of time which results in the inability to respond accurately in the event of an actual emergency. Previous research has demonstrated that providing students with instructions on the use of memorization techniques (mnemonic strategies) has resulted in improvements in their ability to recall information. This study employed a pretest-posttest, control group design to test the effectiveness of this novel mnemonic strategy with respect to the aviators' levels of flight experience, their learning style preferences, and their overall subjective assessments of the system. The design was applied to three distinct groups based on experience levels (highly-experienced, minimally-experienced and naïve). Descriptive and inferential statistics, along with correlations, were used to assess the study data which determined statistically significant differences between the IPS and traditional training methods. Although the study's findings did not show the IPS as producing performance gains superior to that of the traditional method, the findings did demonstrate the utility and merit of the system as an augmentation to traditional textual procedures. The manner in which the symbols were able to facilitate the recall of uncommon, unfamiliar terms and phrases in a naïve population to a level comparable to that of highly-experienced pilots in just one week, highlights the potential for such a mnemonic strategy to aid in the encoding of information into long-term memory. This information could lead to important innovations to current U.S. Army teaching techniques. A standardized pictorial system of aviation procedures may not just benefit individual graduate and student pilots, but could be a valuable contribution to military and civil aviation safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304912017?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=s9oBTMJt%2FFUzVQx29vRy7uQGTGg%3D",""

Previous studies have often treated airline choice as a function of observed variables alone. This research fills the gap by incorporating latent psychological factors using a hybrid modeling approach, providing a more holistic view of the decision-making process. In this study, an attempt was made to examine the personal and travel characteristics of passengers and their impact on airline choice at Mehrabad International Airport, Iran. To identify the structures of latent variables, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used, and they were then presented to a multinomial logit-factor analysis (MNL-FA) hybrid approach as observed variables for the choice model of airline and ticket price. The results of EFA indicated that the number of samples was sufficient for this analysis and FA was appropriate to identify the structure of the factor model. CFA results showed that compatible people paid more attention to airline tangibles and image in airline choice. Also, more extroverted people paid more attention to airline costs and image. Moreover, people with higher conscientiousness paid less attention to airline tangibles in airline choice and the costs associated with an airline were less influential in the choice by these people.

These animals are not considered trainable: They are unable to perform a service, under the legal regulation. We examine commentary on newspaper articles regarding ESAs on airplanes using qualitative coding and data science techniques to assemble narratives dictating attitudes toward ESAs. We identify three narratives within the discourse that dispute the validity of emotional impairment and ESAs and express mistrust and disdain of those claiming a need for ESA companion. Working at the intersection of critical animal and disability geographies, we show how a neoliberal exclusionary discourse on ESAs is driven by an underlying essentializing distinction between debility and health, and the framing of mental and emotional impairment in terms of an individual’s personal responsibility for their health. Moreover, the popular and legal discourse on ESAs creates a sharp distinction in what kind of relationships we can have with animals in particular places. In challenge to these ableist and speciesist discourses, we articulate interspecies interdependence that reframes ESAs as not just furry (or scaly) entitlements, but as guides to a spatial ethic that challenges curative approaches to mental health and promotes a fluid notion of the place of animals and interdependent relationships with them.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3159606952?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=V9cARBZJ4zrOT5Hl%2FrTyEJQ9Yls%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2024.2431295"

Studies with college students usually find that HP is associated with negative outcomes, but this might not be the case with high school students as high levels of parental involvement, advice, and monitoring is more normative and potentially adaptive given teens’ development stage. Thus, the current study adds to the literature by focusing on high school adolescents and by including both parents’ and adolescents’ perspectives on helicopter parenting, as well as reporter discrepancies, to predict adolescents’ depression and anxiety symptoms longitudinally. The sample was 235 adolescents (Mage = 15.12, SD = .48) and at least one parent recruited from the Appalachian region in the Southeastern US. Adolescents and parents reported on measures of HP, and adolescents reported on symptoms of depression and anxiety one year later. Analyses were regression models predicting Wave 2 adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms while covarying parent income, teen gender, and Wave 1 teen depression or anxiety symptoms. Contrary to hypotheses and most research with emerging adults, teen reports of paternal helicopter parenting predicted lower adolescents’ depressive symptoms one year later. Similarly, mother reports of HP were associated with lower teen anxiety symptoms longitudinally. However consistent with hypotheses, larger difference scores between father and teen reports of HP (fathers’ reports higher relative to teens’) predicted more teen depressive symptoms at Wave 2. Overall, the study emphasizes the need to understand both parent and child perspectives of parenting and the meaning of discrepant perspectives. Additionally, more research with high school teens is needed to better understand how adaptive or maladaptive HP may be at this age.HighlightsHelicopter parenting of adolescents is negatively associated with adolescents’ internalizing symptoms one year later.Greater father-teen reporting differences in Helicopter Parenting predicted higher teen depressive symptoms.Understanding both parent and teen perspectives of parenting and discrepancies is important.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3281312432?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=73Y6JunmV3VcVnSbr5xDQljc56g%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-025-03200-1"

This study examined twenty-four pairs of flight instructors and primary flight students who retained this relationship throughout the student's entire primary flight training experience; through to their initial U.S. civilian pilot certification, the private pilot's certificate. Dr. Michael Kirton's Adaption-Innovation Theory of cognitive style was used as the cognitive style paradigm. The instrument associated with A-I theory measures an individual's cognitive style preference on a numeric horizontal scale ranging from highly adaptive on the left to highly innovative on the right. The instrument yields four scores altogether, a main score, and three sub-scale scores: sufficiency of originality, efficiency, and rule/group conformity scores, all indicated along the adaptive-innovative scale (with different ranges). This study examined the effect that cognitive gap (differential scores between two individuals in this case) had on the flight training relationship between flight instructor and student. A gap on the third sub-scale score, rule/group conformity was found to have a significant impact on flight training efficiency, as measured by time spent in flight training until the private pilot check ride was passed by the student. It was found that significantly different scores on this scale led to a reduction in flight training time while similar scores led to an increase in time spent in flight training.

A novel approach incorporating machine learning and virtual reality technology was applied to distinguish features between these participants with different flight skills. Results indicate that SVM with the MIC feature selection method consistently achieved the highest prediction performance on all metrics with an accuracy of 0.93, an AUC of 0.96, and an F1 of 0.93, which outperforms four other classifier algorithms and two other feature selection methods. From the perspective of feature selection methods, the MIC method can select features with a nonlinear relationship to sampling labels instead of a simple filter-out. Our new implementation of the SVM + MIC algorithm outperforms all existing pilot selection algorithms and perhaps provides the first implementation based on eye tracking and flight dynamics data.

A trained relational graph convolutional neural network (CEV-RGCN) model, along with a tianzege-convolutional neural network (CNN), were employed to calculate the feature similarity of Chinese characters based on phonetics and glyphs. Based on this analysis, separate knowledge graphs for phonetics and glyphs were constructed, forming the foundation for a similar character library. During the masking stage of the CKBERT model, both positive and negative samples of knowledge graph triples were generated and integrated into multi-hop comparative learning. Candidate characters are retrieved from the similar character database, and the appropriate character is selected for replacement in the original text based on contextual information and similarity. This led to the development of the Ctc-CKBERT model, which significantly enhanced both computational efficiency and accuracy.

Here we provide evidence for the generality of such a link by having a large sample of naïve participants screen more typical dual-energy x-ray images of hand luggage. The results show that the Attention to Detail score is a linear predictor of threat detection accuracy. We then develop and fine-tune a novel self-report scale for security screening: the XRIndex, which improves on the Attention to Detail scale for predictive power and opacity to interpretation. The XRIndex is not redundant with any of the Big Five personality traits. We validate the XRIndex against security x-ray images with an independent sample of untrained participants and suggest that the XRIndex may be a useful aid for the identification of suitable candidates for professional security training with a focus on x-ray threat detection.

The present study aimed to examine this issue. A sample of 172 typically developing children (77 girls; Mage = 7.14, SDage = 0.33) and their parents participated in the study. Parents reported children’s anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist each year from the first measurement (T1) to the third measurement (T3) and reported their helicopter parenting and tiger parenting at T1. Children completed the Go/No-go task at T1 to measure their IC. Higher T1 helicopter parenting impeded the declines in anxiety and depression over time, and higher T1 tiger parenting predicted more anxiety and depressive symptoms at T3. However, such effects were only observed in children with low IC, and higher IC buffered the adverse impacts of both helicopter parenting and tiger parenting on children’s anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings revealed that helicopter parenting and tiger parenting had negative impacts on the developmental trajectories and outcomes of anxiety and depression in children and suggest that IC plays an important role in alleviating the risks of anxiety and depression among children in adverse environments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3272590036?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=GmF757zqHstHCQ51EWZAARymSVY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-024-01685-3"

Based on gender congruence theory, we hypothesized that daughters’ well-being would be more adversely impacted by their mothers’ helicopter parenting compared to fathers’, while the opposite pattern would emerge for sons.MethodParticipants were 446 college students between 18–25 years old who completed an online survey. The majority of participants were white, female, underclassman from middle to upper-middle class families.ResultsParticipants reported that their mothers engaged in more helicopter parenting than their fathers. Male and female participants did not differ in the amount of helicopter parenting they experienced, so we tested a model combining these sub-samples. Two minor differences were identified: Daughters reported maternal helicopter parenting was more strongly associated with decreased autonomy and sons reported paternal helicopter parenting was more strongly associated with a decreased relatedness. Thus, a partial equivalence model was tested with only these two paths free to vary between groups. Maternal helicopter parenting was indirectly associated with their children’s reduced well-being on all three measures (i.e., anxiety, depression, and satisfaction with life) through a reduced sense of autonomy and competence. Paternal helicopter parenting was only indirectly associated with their offspring’s well-being through autonomy.ConclusionsResults supported prior research suggesting helicopter parenting adversely affects emerging adults’ well-being through its negative impact on the basic psychological needs of self-determination.

The results have implications for training and system design in distributed environments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1885890721?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=7jLgz%2FQE6KxJGURBgmR0qBu%2FsCg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/S014271641600031X"

Seventy-seven students were randomized to either a non-technical skills seminar (NTS group, n=43) or a medical seminar (control group, n=34). The human patient simulation was used as an evaluation tool. Before the seminars, all students performed the same simulated emergency scenario to provide baseline measurements. After the seminars, all students were exposed to a second scenario, and behavioural markers for evaluating their nontechnical skills were rated. Furthermore, teamwork-relevant attitudes were measured before and after the scenarios, and perceived stress was measured following each simulation. All simulations were also evaluated for various medical endpoints. Non-technical skills concerning situation awareness (p<.01, r=0.5) and teamwork (p<.01, r=0.45) improved from simulation I to II in the NTS group. Decision making improved in both groups (NTS: p<.01, r=0.39; control: p<.01, r=0.46). The attitude ?handling errors? improved significantly in the NTS group (p<.05, r=0.34).

We utilized a self-determination theoretical framework to replicate and expand current research regarding the impact of helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting on emerging adult mental and physical well-being. Further, we examined self-efficacy as a mechanism for helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting to impact well-being, using structural equation modeling with a sample of 461 emerging adult college students from a large southeastern, United States university. The two-factor structure of the Helicopter Parenting Behaviors measure was confirmed, indicating helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting are two unique, but related, constructs. Both autonomy supportive parenting and helicopter parenting were found to have indirect effects on anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, and physical health through self-efficacy. Results also indicated autonomy supportive parenting was directly related to life satisfaction and physical health when accounting for self-efficacy, whereas helicopter parenting was not directly related to well-being.

While dissociative experiences (DE) draw attention as a problem that negatively affects the individual's perception of reality, the relationship of these two factors with such experiences gains importance. The objective of this study is to reveal the predictive power of adolescents’ DAs and perceived helicopter parental attitudes (PHPA) on DE. This study, in which the correlational survey model was used, was conducted with 543 adolescents. Data were collected using sociodemographic form, digital addiction scale, perceived helicopter parent scale and adolescent dissociative experiences scale. DA level and PHPA were found to have a significant effect on adolescents’ DE. While adolescents' DA level alone and with perceived helicopter father attitude (PHFA) had an effect on DE. When perceived helicopter mother attitude (PHMA) came into play, father attitude lost its significance and DA and PHMA together predicted adolescents' DE. In addition, adolescents who perceived their parents as “helicopter mother” and “normally father” had significantly higher DE scores. DA and PHPA cause adolescents to have DE. The PHMA eliminated the function of the father on adolescents' DE. Moreover, children with helicopter mother perception and normal father perception had more DE. These are important results showing the impact of digital addiction and parents, especially the mother, on the personality development of adolescents.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3230744053?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=4yVRnUqAdYPkwj3PmWK%2FljX65jE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.23495"

Therefore, it is necessary to explore the connection between coal mine workers’ neural activity and unsafe behavior from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. This study explored the functional brain connectivity of coal mine workers who have engaged in unsafe behaviors (EUB) and those who have not (NUB). (2) Methods: Based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a total of 106 workers from the Hongliulin coal mine of Shaanxi North Mining Group, one of the largest modern coal mines in China, completed the test. Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (COR) analysis, brain network analysis, and two-sample t-test were used to investigate the difference in brain functional connectivity between the two groups. (3) Results: The results showed that there were significant differences in functional brain connectivity between EUB and NUB among the frontopolar area (p = 0.002325), orbitofrontal area (p = 0.02102), and pars triangularis Broca’s area (p = 0.02888).

High and average levels of stress resistance were detected in 42 rock climbers (70%) while most adults involved in non-extreme sports had the average levels of stress resistance. It is shown that climbers perceive a large number of situations as threatening and provoking the anxiety (the selfpreservation instinct). High psychological variability and adaptability to external conditions are associated with low levels of neuroticism, high stability, and lability. Increasing the self-esteem of athletes boosts stress resistance. These research results allow us to conclude that the structure of stress resistance of athletes facing high risksis balanced and defined by one's systemic volitional capabilities (strength and stability), self-control behavior (self-esteem) and features of the nervous system which are characterized by susceptibility to external events (neuroticism).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2378908631?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Z6X6LwvO%2F4DTXMpYacvwh9WPh4M%3D","https://doi.org/10.7752/jpes.2020.sl069"

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 130 managers' conflict management styles were assessed by applying the Rahim's 1983 Organizational Conflict Inventory-II. Findings - First, integrating and, second, compromising are found to be the most preferred conflict styles of Turkish managers. The other important finding is that preferring obliging styles of conflict management changes according to the status of managers. Obliging is mostly used when the conflict partner has an upper level status. Research limitations/implications - Additional data from cross-cultural studies are needed to form a comprehensive understanding of conflict management styles. Also, the number of respondents in the study is not enough to generalize the findings; additional data from different sectors could make the findings more valid. Practical implications - There seems to be a need for seminars or practice-oriented workshops on evaluating and understanding the nature of conflict and learning to manage conflict as a beneficial and creative process for the betterment of both individuals in organizations and organizations themselves. Originality/value - The study provides a revised base for cross-cultural conflict management studies and also highlights the national dynamics of Turkish managers' relationships, especially for international investors.

Most people with dementia live at home alone or are cared for by informal caregivers, typically their spouses or other family members. However, no suitable screening tools for home-dwelling patients with dementia have been developed, nor have measurements focused on executive and self-eating functions. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dietary Function Assessment Scale (DFAS) for community-dwelling persons with dementia.MethodsA mixed-method design was used to develop the instrument. Methods included a comprehensive literature review to identify the item pool and an expert panel to assess the initial item pool. We performed convenience sampling of 190 home-dwelling people with dementia for psychometrical evaluation. The psychometric properties tests included item and factor analyses, criterion-related validity testing, internal consistency reliability testing, and defining the optimal cut-off values. The study was conducted from 2018 to 2019.ResultsItems were generated based on an extensive literature review and pre-existing scales related to mealtime and executive functions in persons with dementia. The S-CVI/Ave of the DFAS was 0.89. A Principal Component factor analysis demonstrated seven items, with a two-factor structure accounting for 56.94% of the total variance. The two extracted factors were Self-eating ability and Dietary executive function. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good model fit. The criterion-related validity was adequate (r = -0.528, p < 0.01). The reliability of Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency was 0.74, and McDonald’s Omega coefficient was 0.80; the optimal cut-off value of 13 points with an AUC of 0.74 was established to determine poor dietary functioning in persons with dementia.ConclusionThe DFAS was simple, user-friendly, and a valid and reliable instrument to assess dietary functioning in community-dwelling persons with dementia. This short scale can be helpful for caretakers, who can use it to identify the dietary needs of home-dwelling persons with dementia and improve their care and eating experience.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2815625892?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=m837vgV3V2gZVT%2BBmYtVOvnC1J8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-023-01314-9"

Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro.Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = -0.46, p< 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p< 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p< 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p< 0.01.RESULTSResilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = -0.46, p < 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) were positively correlated.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity of repeated performance testing during spaceflight. Four National Aeronautics and Space Administration crewmembers were trained to complete computerized questionnaires and performance tasks at repeated regular intervals before and after a 10-day shuttle mission and at times that interfered minimally with other mission activities during spaceflight. Two types of performance, Digit-Symbol Substitution trial completion rates and response times during the most complex Number Recognition trials, were altered slightly during spaceflight. All other dimensions of the performance tasks remained essentially unchanged over the course of the study. Verbal ratings of Fatigue increased slightly during spaceflight and decreased during the postflight test sessions. Arousal ratings increased during spaceflight and decreased postflight. No other consistent changes in rating-scale measures were observed over the course of the study. Crewmembers completed all mission requirements in an efficient manner with no indication of clinically significant behavioral impairment during the 10-day spaceflight. These results support the feasibility and utility of computerized task performances and questionnaire rating scales for repeated measurement of behavior during spaceflight.

Currently, health and wellbeing approaches at an aviation organisational level are not addressing both human and safety needs. This issue has been intensified since the COVID 19 pandemic. This paper reports on the findings of a survey pertaining to aviation worker wellbeing and organisational approaches to managing wellbeing and mental health. The survey was administered at two different time periods during the COVID 19 pandemic (2020 and 2021). Collectively, feedback was obtained from over 3000 aviation workers. Survey feedback indicates that aviation workers are experiencing considerable challenges in relation to their health and wellbeing. These challenges are not being adequately addressed at an organisational level, which creates risk both from an individual and flight safety perspective. The descriptive findings of both surveys along with a regression analysis is used to make a principled case for augmenting the existing approach to managing aviation worker wellbeing (including mental health), at both an organisational and regulatory level. It is argued that aviation organisations, with the support of the regulator should implement a preventative, ethical and evidence-based strategy to managing wellbeing and mental health risk. Critically, aviation organisations need to advance and integrated health, wellbeing, and safety culture. This necessitates an alignment of human, business, and safety objectives, as articulated in concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and responsible work. Critically, this approach depends on trust and the specification of appropriate protections, so that aviation workers feel safe to routinely report wellbeing levels and challenges, and their impact on operational safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2778763466?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=qfEGMROXHpIo%2Fea%2FtBsFUvdReQ0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-022-00711-5"

Chapter 2 (""Setting the table"") provides an accurate and concise overview of the history of Medicare, starting with Mackenzie King's 1919 call for a national health insurance program, and continuing through the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike, the passage of Medicare, and later developments including the Canada Health Act. For those unfamiliar with this history, Rachlis' summary provides an understandable and lucid commentary.From a consumer perspective, the biggest single health system issue is that of waiting time. Rachlis cites of 2003 study which found that ""Canadians were more likely than Americans Australians, Britons, or New Zealanders to report undue waits for procedures and difficulty seeing a specialist"" (253). In chapter 11 (""Waiting for this, waiting for that""), Rachlis confronts this sensitive issue. He makes some very wellreasoned arguments about wait times. He notes that precise measurement of waiting times is challenging, making it difficult to assess the extent of the problem or if improvements are being made. Rachlis also notes the difficulty inherent in doctorcontrolled waiting lists. The lack of available data for managers makes it next to impossible to implement effective evidence-based management of waiting lists or flexible use of resources to accommodate new patients. Rachlis' analysis of the problem is sound, but is somewhat eclipsed by such statements as ""only one in two hundred Ontario heart-surgery waiting list patients dies before having surgery."" Does Rachlis consider this acceptable? If so, on what basis and what does he use as a point of comparison? (is a .5 percent failure rate for commercial aviation acceptable?) Similarly, Rachlis advises that ""if you have a less serious case of heart disease or cancer, it might actually be nice to have two or three weeks to get your affairs in order, arrange care for children, cat, or partner, and contemplate life."" While it is true that waiting for certain procedures may have little effect on clinical outcomes, I've met no one for whom the emotional and psychological result of waiting was positive. Rachlis risks being viewed as an apologist for health system problems, and such statements are unnecessary given his encouraging use of positive Canadian examples for reducing wait times. A case management program in Saskatoon is cited as a best practice which succeeded in reducing waiting time for long-term care beds from two hundred persons in the early 1990s to fewer than thirty (while this success is laudable, Rachlis notes that the systemic problem remains of poor or non-existent coordination among the three Saskatoon hospitals). He further describes how health professionals in Sault Ste. Marie succeeded in reducing waiting times for breast cancer surgery.

The definition of situation awareness has evolved over time to include psychophysiological state management, stress inoculation, and cognitive components. This paper utilizes a mixed methods design to examine a training program, which claims to combine the aforementioned situation awareness components in protocols developed for military, law enforcement, and private security personnel. Four past participants of the training program completed in-depth, semi-structured interviews about their experience with the training. Subsequently, a training-specific survey was developed to more thoroughly investigate trainees’ experiences. Survey responses of the program’s trainees (n = 32) were compared to non-program trainees from similar fields (n = 35) on quantitative measures. Open-ended responses of the program’s trainees were qualitatively analyzed. Overall, program trainees were found to perceive the training as positively impacting their situation awareness ability in stressful/threatening situations and non-stressful situations compared to the non-program trainees. Qualitative analyses conducted with the interviews and on open-response survey items provide descriptive explanations for how the training program is perceived to be influencing situation awareness abilities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2918766847?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2FA4OqC%2B%2FrfpFX0RxiQJnRNojlHU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11896-018-9291-z"

In a similar fashion, as leaders of learning, professors should follow the precepts of educational psychology to inspire students to deeply learn the course material. A student who is made passionate about learning a topic will fill his or her own bucket with greater expedience and efficiency than any professor can. This is a testament to the virtues of intrinsic, versus extrinsic, motivation. An optimal learning environment can be crafted, first, by providing a setting for academic success. A savvy professor can then design the course assessment scheme around harnessing student desires for autonomy. Role modeling can be integrated into the curriculum to shape student attitude and behavior. In similar fashion, an overall reinforcement plan can be instituted to reward appropriate student behavior. Following these tenets, educators can make learning an autotelic event that it is a self-contained activity, pursue by students not just for a good grade, but for the sake of learning itself (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1689404837?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=5Tvx2BXGl9hcl5kN%2FrDX8S%2BAEwU%3D",""

It was hypothesized that students with parents who are overly controlling will have higher levels of anxiety and depression and lower levels of self-efficacy, leading to poorer college adjustment, as evidenced by grade point average, academic adjustment, and social adjustment to college. The structural model was generally supported by the data, indicating an indirect effect of helicopter parenting on college adjustment, thus confirming the importance of the relationship between healthy parenting and college student mental health and, subsequently, student success.

We therefore investigated whether functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a portable brain neuroimaging technique, can be used to distinguish between high and low levels of task engagement during the performance of a selective attention task. A group of participants performed the multi-source interference task (MSIT) while we recorded brain activity with fNIRS from two brain regions. One was a key region of the “task-positive” network, which is associated with relatively high levels of task engagement. The second was a key region of the “task-negative” network, which is associated with relatively low levels of task engagement (e.g., resting and not performing a task). Using activity in these regions as inputs to a multivariate pattern classifier, we were able to predict above chance levels whether participants were engaged in performing the MSIT or resting. We were also able to replicate prior findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indicating that activity in task-positive and task-negative regions is negatively correlated during task performance. Finally, data from a companion fMRI study verified our assumptions about the sources of brain activity in the fNIRS experiment and established an upper bound on classification accuracy in our task. Together, our findings suggest that fNIRS could prove quite useful for monitoring cognitive state in real-world settings.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2292228958?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=b5u8YhQsgmBK%2BzCUn3Bl82VxmUg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00861"

Twenty-four participants conducted a flight simulator task with three difficulty levels and were asked to rate their perceived demand and effort using the NASA TLX. We recorded heart rate, EEG brain activity, and pupil size to assess changes in the participants’ mental and physiological states across different task demands. We found that, despite group-level correlations between performance error and physiological responses, individual differences in physiological responses to task demands reflected different levels of participant effort and task efficiency. These findings suggest that physiological monitoring of student pilots might provide beneficial insights to flight instructors to optimize pilot training at the individual level.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2858090567?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=BhM%2FnEqf7tFyAH6ZmLtAfYAc5bc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41427-4"

In the aviation domain, the two different roles of crews in the cockpit—pilot flying (PF) versus pilot monitoring (PM)—are responsible for different tasks. However, little is known about how role assignment shapes pilots’ perceived risk. We designed a flight‐simulation experiment where 57 professional pilots completed two counterbalanced approaches under different role assignments with the assistance of a flight instructor in a full flight simulator. Their perceived risks were measured by psychophysiological responses and compared between the two different cockpit roles. Results indicate that participants exhibited stronger psychophysiological responses (e.g., higher subjective ratings, skin conductance responses, heart rates, and inter‐beat intervals) when they served as PF than PM. Particularly, they reported higher scores in affect, susceptibility, and severity dimensions as PF than PM. The asymmetrically psychophysiological responses between the two varying roles in the cockpit emphasize the importance of controllability in shaping the pilot's perceived risk. Theoretically, our findings contribute to the existing literature on pilots’ perceived risk. Practically, we pave the way for engaging specific interventions and training for improving crew performance and flight safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3254713998?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=veC5VgJVnVVebo1%2FCVOW7BlmtUs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.70048"

The authors proceed from the assumption that enhancement of the subject’s life activity requires taking into account the existing and expanding (or forming), in the given direction, style peculiarities of the activity in mutual connection to its personal qualities. The article reflects the basic theoretical foundations of the conducted research and the empirical data obtained on students’ communication styles and their connection with the mental qualities of the personality. It is revealed that modern student youth is characterized by use in communication of a wide range of means, among which, according to various classifications, prevail styles such as: altruistic, cooperative, collegial, liberal, dialogical, compromise, whichintheir content indicate the orientation of the subject on partner, cooperation with him, finding a common solution, mutual respect, etc., demonstrating the ability to communicate. The data obtained also indicate the need for students to expand the irarsenal of communication toolsanduse the ircap abilitiesin a variety of conditions and requirements of life activities. The study proved that there is a mutual connection between the communication styles with the mental (personality) qualities of students: personality qualities may lead to an inclination for a particular style of communication, and vice versa.

We investigated attentional allocation by registering participants' eye movements while they performed a new time-sharing task that forced them to solve resource conflicts between subtasks through prioritization. Participants were monitoring four subtasks each requiring different amounts of visual attention and response frequencies. Participants' attention allocation was operationalized in terms of the time spent dwelling on subtasks, the rate they visually sampled the tasks, and the duration of dwells. Additionally, the accuracy of responses and efficiency of time-sharing were estimated. In Experiment 1, we studied adaptation to a time-sharing environment in which priority order of the subtasks was kept constant from trial to trial. We found that the participants sampled the most important subtasks more frequently, spent more time on them, and shifted their gaze earlier to them than to less important subtasks. That is, they allocated their attention according to the subtask priorities. In Experiment 2, subtask priorities changed from trial to trial. Despite the higher demands of the constantly changing situation, participants again adapted to the varying priorities of the subtasks almost instantly. Our results suggest that performance in complex and dynamic time-sharing situations is not managed by a system relying on liberal resource allocation policies and gradual learning. Instead, the participants' rapid adaptation is more consistent with tighter executive and authoritative control and intelligent use of prioritization information.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2637717195?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=vEOzkRNHC2J1UgwpH9q032BWY28%3D","https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-021-02377-z"

Data collected from 296 aviation employees were analyzed using SPSS 25 and SPSS Process Macro programs for determining moderating effects. The findings revealed that emotional contagion has a positive and significant effect on organisational identification. It has been determined that individuals’ age and seniority differences have a moderating role in the effect of emotional contagion on organisational identification. The fact that the scope of the research is a single sector and organisation hinders the findings’ generalizability. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to explain the cause-and-effect relationships between psychological factors. The results proved that positive emotions affect individuals faster than negative emotions and are more effective on OI. Hence, the establishment of an organisational climate dominated by feelings of love and happiness and devoid of feelings of fear and anger is recommended for managers seeking to foster OI.

Furthermore, specific features of the job can increase a pilot’s risk in relation to developing a mental health (MH) issue. It is impossible to remove all stress from the work life of pilots. A high stress situation may not necessarily be detrimental to the person, once they have learned to cope with it in a healthy manner. Nonetheless, risk pertaining to WRS need to be effectively managed by a pilot’s employer. Therefore, it is important to identify solutions at an airline and pilot self-management level. This paper reports on the findings of human factors research undertaken with commercial pilots pertaining to work-related stress (WRS) and its impact on wellbeing, performance, and safety. The findings of a series of co-design workshops and a follow-up anonymous survey were analysed to identify potential solutions at (1) an airline and (2) pilot self-management level. Potential solutions are framed in relation to six impact scenarios. Furthermore, they are located within the existing regulatory framework, including the latest implementation rules (IR), acceptable means of compliance (ACM), and guidance material (GM) as outlined by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA 2019). Proposed interventions should promote wellbeing and positive mental health while also addressing suffering and mental ill health. Airline interventions might focus on enhancing existing Safety Management System (SMS) approaches to better manage risks pertaining to WRS, advancing new tools to enable wellbeing briefing, risk assessment, and reporting, and training pilots in relation to MH awareness, risk identifying behaviour, and coping strategies. Furthermore, new role/functions might be introduced to support the implementation and management of WRS/wellbeing/MH safety/risk processes at an airline level. Requirements for new digital tools to support pilot awareness of WRS/wellbeing/MH, self-management of WRS/wellbeing/MH and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit are also proposed.

The paradox of employee involvement, however, implies that helping behavior can be intrusive and obstructive. The primary purpose of this article is to conceptualize helicopter helping as an intrusive and obstructive type of discretionary workplace behavior. In addition, the authors discuss possible antecedents and consequences of helicopter helping.Design/methodology/approachTo conceptualize helicopter helping, the authors utilized the ABI/INFORM Global, Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, PsycARTICLES and JSTOR Archive Collection databases focusing on the helping behavior and helicopter parenting research. In particular, the authors applied the hovering nature of helicopter parenting to the conceptualization of helicopter helping exhibited by an employee in the organization. Additionally, the authors discuss antecedents and consequences of helicopter helping by integrating the bright and dark side of helping behavior research.FindingsThe authors conceptualize helicopter helping as an employee's excessive involvement in and interference with coworkers' task environment. Based upon the conceptualization of helicopter helping, the authors further propose that the need for achievement, Type-A personality, group rewards, high-performance group norms, a hierarchy organizational culture and strong social ties are possible antecedents of helicopter helping. Furthermore, the authors suggest that helicopter helping can result in reduced organization-based self-esteem, general self-efficacy, group creativity and innovation, quality of social-exchange relationships, learning and development and increased organizational vulnerability.Originality/valueThis article is one of the few studies exploring helping behavior from an intrusive and invasive perspective.

While appearing non-threatening, such demeanor may reflect controlled dissociation or intentional affect suppression. Despite global advancements in behavioral detection, this specific form of ambiguity remains underexamined in risk profiling frameworks. This paper introduces “radical calm” as a novel construct within behavioral profiling, highlighting its relevance for identifying concealed threats that evade traditional detection models. Methods This study integrates established psychological theories of dissociation with analysis of real-world incidents, including behaviors exhibited by 9/11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah, as well as comparative profiles of drug couriers and ideologically driven actors. A targeted literature review (2020–2024) was conducted alongside qualitative behavioral assessment using psychophysiological indicators and threat-context variables. Results Findings reveal that controlled dissociation—characterized by emotional neutrality, inhibited microexpressive output, and suppression of physical agitation—is a recurring trait among high-risk individuals at aviation checkpoints. These behavioral patterns often bypass standard stress-detection protocols, but become detectable through integrated contextual and kinetic profiling. Conclusion The phenomenon of “radical calm” warrants formal classification as a distinct risk marker in aviation security. This study introduces a foundational behavioral model to support frontline personnel in identifying deceptive calmness and decoding subtle nonverbal anomalies. Enhancing profiler awareness of dissociative suppression may significantly improve early threat recognition and intervention capabilities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3251907924?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=MOkJ%2FWo789XX%2FygoMnagCJWjnJM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12198-025-00307-w"

It is insufficient for workers to be satisfied – they have to be engaged in their work to deal with crises and situations never encountered before. Thus, investigating the antecedents of work engagement and their interactive effects is crucial to organizational survival. The paper examines the impact of the trait of curiosity on proactive personality, which ultimately leads to work engagement. The moderated-mediation model looks at the mediating effect of proactive personality on the relationship between curiosity and work engagement. It also examines the moderating effect of organizational culture perceptions on the relationship between curiosity and proactive personality. A sample of 327 respondents was collected from 32 organizations in the aviation industry in the United Arab Emirates through purposive sampling. The hypothesized associations were analyzed via structural equation modelling. As predicted, proactive personality is a mediator, and organizational culture moderates the said relationships. Managers desirous of improving employees’ work engagement will now understand how employees’ curiosity can enhance work engagement through proactive personality. Managers can also ensure that organizational culture can further strengthen the relationship between curiosity and proactive personality.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3145814437?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=rK6td1hZaCxp8OC9%2BCsAaCCbwAI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/03063070221141201"

However, little is known about whether or not different populations exhibit similar levels of individual variability. In the present study, we examined individual variability in performance impairment due to sleep loss in a highly select population of military jet pilots. Ten active-duty F-117 pilots were deprived of sleep for 38 h and studied repeatedly in a high-fidelity flight simulator. Data were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA to quantify individual variability. Statistically significant, systematic individual differences in the effects of sleep deprivation were observed, even when baseline differences were accounted for. The findings suggest that highly select populations may exhibit individual differences in vulnerability to performance impairment from sleep loss just as the general population does. Thus, the scientific and operational communities' reliance on group data as opposed to individual data may entail substantial misestimation of the impact of job-related Stressors on safety and performance.

Aviation, for example, uses prototype modeling to develop improved aircraft from one generation to the next. In stark contrast to prototype modeling's search for causal mechanisms, assessment technologies remain dominated by probability strategies-which is why psychological assessment lags behind the hard sciences. A major difference in results exists between inferences produced through item response theory versus the cause-effect prototyping strategies of aerospace and other techno-savvy industries. Parallel to aerospace strategies, systems analysis of language, using prototype modeling strategies, provides an effective assessment technology. This paper shows how the result provides causal mechanisms easily employed for assessing, predicting and changing human performance in many contexts.

It is imperative to develop an effective fatigue risk management system to improve aviation safety based upon scientific approaches.Two empirical studies were conducted to address this issue. Study 1 investigated the mixed effect of circadian rhythm disorders and resource depletion on controllers’ accumulated fatigue. Then, study 2 proposed a potential biofeedback solution of quick coherence technique which can mitigate air traffic controllers’ (ATCOs’) fatigue while on controller working position and improve ATCOs’ mental/physical health.The current two‐studies demonstrated a scientific approach to fatigue analysis and fatigue risk mitigation in the air traffic services domain. This research offers insights into the fluctuation of ATCO fatigue levels and the influence of a numbers of factors related to circadian rhythm and resource depletion impact on fatigue levels on study 1; and provides psychophysiological coherence training to increase ATCOs’ fatigue resilience to mitigate negative impacts of fatigue on study 2.Based on these two studies, the authors recommended that an extra short break for air traffic controllers to permit practicing the quick coherence breathing technique for 5 min at the sixth working hour could substantially recharge cognitive resources and increase fatigue resilience. Application: Present studies highlight an effective fatigue intervention based on objective biofeedback to moderate controllers’ accumulated fatigue as a result of rotating shift work. Accordingly, air navigation services providers and regulators can develop fatigue risk management systems based on scientific approaches to improve aviation safety and air traffic controller's wellbeing.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2781579394?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=lnXzVd86eP%2BtPsQNZVz0RyjOQ8I%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13899"

Results generally supported the hypothesized mediation model, but associations depended on the specific helicopter parenting behavior, emotion dysregulation dimension, and mental health outcome. Autonomy limiting was particularly detrimental to all emotion dysregulation dimensions and mental health, whereas information-seeking behaviors may be beneficial to emerging adults’ outcomes. Impulse control difficulties and lack of emotional clarity emerged as robust mediators.

In 3 experiments using a complex aviation task, the authors contrasted instructions that explicitly stated pre- and postconditions with conventional instructions that did not. The instructions with pre- and postconditions led to better and more robust performance than other instructions, especially on problems that required transfer.

In our qualitative, empirical study we refer to these changes as part of a global tendency in the civil aviation sector to intensify the workload and undermine occupational health and safety standards. Defining this as “Ryanairisation”, we argue that the flagship airlines are pushed towards a neoliberal labour model. Via an embedded and relational comparison, we want to highlight labour conflicts in transnational corporations as a relevant sub-discipline of peace and conflict studies along two research questions: Firstly, what corporal impact does Ryanairisation have on cabin crew workers in Argentina (Aerolíneas Argentinas) and Portugal (TAP) during the first stages of renationalisation processes? Secondly, how do cabin crew workers resist the impact at the scale of their bodies? To answer both questions, we combine concepts from Social Reproduction Theory (SRT) and materialist state theory. Despite increasing salaries and improving general working conditions in both countries, we see how nationalised companies relied on the intensification of labour and are pushing workers’ very physical and mental boundaries. We aim to highlight less visible conflicts at workplaces, a) at a rather individual level, b) hybrid collaborative workplace action, and c) organised in trade unions via open confrontations. Workers address the encroachment on their boundaries in diverse ways, from individual to organised forms of resistance.

The scenes were interrupted by the display of a black screen and then started again after a forward or backward shift. The participant's task was to determine whether the moving scene had been shifted forward or backward. A forward misjudgment of the final position of the moving scene was interpreted as a representational momentum (RM) effect. Experiment 1 showed that an RM effect was detected only for experts. The lack of motion anticipation on the part of novices is a surprising result for the RM literature. It could be related to scene unfamiliarity, encoding time, or shift size. Experiment 2 was run with novices only. It was aimed at testing the potential impact of 2 factors on the RM effect: scene encoding time and shift size.

However, communication time is limited in the high-tech, fast-paced oncology clinic setting. Semantic field representations (e. g., a word picture) may efficiently capture the patient's story and could be used to stimulate nurse-patient conversation. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of patients creating a Wordle® to communicate their personal stories with a clinic nurse. Outcomes included participation months. Intake data indicated anxious symptoms, and she endorsed fear of recurrence. She was unable to identify where she derived meaning in life. The patient met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobia, Situational (airplanes), which she reported struggling with for years. Within ACT, the patient was conceptualized as suffering with anxious symptoms that impaired daily functioning and overwhelmed her ability to engage in valued behaviors. She consistently avoided her internal experiences and believed that she needed to ""feel better"" to improve her mental health. The patient was seen for 13 sessions during which ACT-consistent interventions were employed. While the patient continues to experience anxious symptoms and meet criteria for Specific Phobia, her emotional symptoms are manageable. More importantly, she has enriched life by becoming more mindful and accepting of her internal experiences, identifying personal values and goals, and engaging in activities of valued living including a family vacation that necessitated airplane flights. She has terminated this episode of care, requesting periodic maintenance sessions. Recognition that ACT is a suitable and effective treatment for cancer survivors is increasing (Angiola & Bowen, 2013). This case study illustrates the utility of ACT with cancer survivors, and especially highlights how treatment can address both premorbid anxiety disorders and more specific cancer-related worry. This case highlights the need for further research into the specific applications of ACT for cancer survivors. Clinicians interested in acceptance-based therapy approaches may benefit from reviewing a case in which premorbid and cancer-specific anxiety was treated using ACT with good treatment gains.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1503917622?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=VwF4Ac9J9RCgG2fzW5AkAq%2By3WE%3D",""

Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching. Each condition was independently sufficient for participants to show cumulative learning. Because emulative learning can elicit cumulative culture on this task, we conclude that accounts of the unusual complexity of human culture in terms of species-unique learning mechanisms do not currently provide complete explanations and that other factors may be involved.

The researchers argued that the participants in these debates, mostly diplomats representing member states, have been employing depoliticisation techniques to terminate inconvenient debates, claiming that the ICAO is a technical organisation and political issues should not be debated there. The study covers several diplomatic standoffs at the ICAO forum: debates over ICAO membership/statehood in Spain, Taiwan, Cyprus and South Africa; various instances of the Arab-Israeli conflict; shootdowns of the Korean aircraft by the USSR and the Iranian aircraft by the US; and aviation aspects of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

Fitts is widely regarded as founder of the applied field of engineering psychology and the basic field of human performance, both based on a human information processing approach. Gibson founded ecological psychology, a school of thought that runs counter to the information processing approach and adopts a radical empiricist approach to perception and action in natural environments. Despite the origins of their disparate views in applied aviation psychology and each having had major impacts on the field of psychology, Gibson and Fitts seem to have had little contact with each other, and their research traditions have continued primarily along separate paths to this day.

"Towards a stereoscopic plan position indicator display","","Banton, Peter Geoffrey","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","1999-01-01","1999","","","","","","","ENG","Within a 90° viewpoint-elevation, stereoscopic display, a series of experiments examined the effects on perceived object location of manipulations of three monocular depth cues: relative size, relative luminance and linear disparity. The early experiments required subjects to make 'closer/farther' depth discriminations between a central 'target' object and two flanking objects of constant size and luminance. The depth within the configuration was determined by the relative disparity between the target and flanking objects. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that when target size (visual angle), or luminance, was varied relative to the two flanking objects independently of the depth between them, two of the four subjects' closer/farther depth judgements were little affected. The other two subjects were influenced to a far larger extent by the manipulations of relative size and luminance. For these two subjects an increase/decrease in target size relative to the flankers of around 3 arc min equated to a depth shift of around 5 arc min of disparity. A doubling/halving of target luminance around the standard level of 20 cd/m2 equated to a depth shift of over 5 arc min of disparity. Experiments 4 and 5 showed this type of perceptual behaviour occurred in approximately 30% of a larger sample of 84 subjects and that for the original two subjects, the observed effects of size/luminance variations could be reduced by increasing stimulus presentation time from 500 msec to 1000 msec. It is concluded that for presentation times of around 500 msec, accurate relative depth judgements in a stereoscopic display are better supported by varying the size (visual angle) of a target object with its depth in a veridical manner. Experiments 8-16 employed a stereoscopic, radar-like display. Subjects were required to indicate the elevation angle of a target relative to the range-ring plane of the display. Results showed a cyclical effect of target azimuth on elevation judgements such that the maximum errors occurred at the 0° and 180° azimuths while the minimum errors occurred at the 90° and 270° azimuths. The use of a veridical perspective projection had two effects: the cyclical variation of target elevation error with target azimuth disappeared and the absolute error across all azimuths and elevations reduced. Manipulations of the GFOV of the perspective projection produced conflicting results. Comparing the mean absolute elevation judgement error across three separate experiments indicated reducing error with increasing GFOV. However, the results of a completely within-subjects design experiment showed an increase in distance judgement error with increasing GFOV. It is concluded that a perspective projection supports more accurate performance in a stereoscopic display than a parallel projection.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304558663?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=GHaiNju1hDym%2BcTKOHgmKkBFLgA%3D",""

This study’s primary purpose is to determine how UAVs that operate in controlled airspace would influence air traffic controllers’ occupational stress and performance. In a within-subject experimental research design, 24 participants sampled from a university’s undergraduate Air Traffic Management (ATM) program completed three different air traffic control (ATC) scenarios on an en route ATC simulation system. The degree of UAV automation and control were varied in each scenario. The participants’ stress levels, performance, and workload were measured with both objective and subjective measurements. Within-subjects ANOVA tests showed significant effects on the participants’ stress level, performance, and workload when automated UAVs were present in the scenario. Participants experienced increased workload, the highest level of stress, and carried out the worst performance when with controllable UAVs in the airspace. These findings can inform UAV integration into controlled airspace and future research into UAV automation and control and ATC management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2564501462?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=O2jZq75BfzBbNamxmbyWZB86cVc%3D",""

Decision-makers who are compelled to act in such circumstances, may be informed by some level of analysis if available, or else may have to rely on their unsupported judgement. This paper presents three engineering risk decision-making case studies across a 20 year span from the rail, aerospace, and military aviation contexts, highlighting the fallibilities of using unsupported judgements in an unstructured manner. To help situate this type of decision situation, we provide a descriptive model of the decision space which extends an existing description from the discipline of decision analysis. Furthermore, to help make and describe the distinction between unsupported and supported thinking, we provide another descriptive model, this time drawing parallels with the distinction made between Type 1 and Type 2 reasoning. This model is an extension of the default-interventionist model from cognitive psychology. The paper concludes that there is a pressing need to provide some form of support to engineering decision-makers facing operational decisions under severe time pressure. While the ultimate aim must be to improve the quality of decision-making, improved transparency is an important additional benefit. Increased emphasis on decision justification and self-awareness are suggested as potential ways of improving this situation. A further contribution of this paper is to identify and strengthen linkages between safety science and two other relevant disciplines, decision analysis and psychology. Such linkages make it easier to communicate across traditional disciplinary boundaries and may provide opportunities for interdisciplinary learning or suggest future directions for collaborative research.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2725646054?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=hPAcJ%2FaKvisYaqM%2FWVRHMHNoZTg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105756"

Screening tools for mental health risks in airline pilots are needed. There is growing interest in pilot peer-support programs and how to incorporate them in a just culture, meaning that pilots can report mental health complaints without a risk of job or income loss. We combined findings from aviation accidents and incidents with a search of scientific literature to provide data-based recommendations for screening, peer-support, and a just culture approach to mental health problems.METHODS: Commercial aviation accidents and incidents in which a mental disorder of a pilot was thought to play a role were reviewed. Subsequently, PubMed and PsychInfo literature searches were performed on peer-support programs, just culture human resource management, and the risk of negative life events on developing suicidal ideation and behavior in comparable professional groups.RESULTS: Lethal accidents were mostly related to impaired coping with negative life events. Negative life events are clearly related to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completed suicide. A protective effect of peer-support programs on mental health problems has not been established, although peer-support programs are generally appreciated by those involved. We did not find relevant literature on just culture.DISCUSSION: Negative life events are likely a useful screening tool for mental health risks. There is still a lack of evidence on how peer-support groups should be designed and how management of mental health risks can be implemented in a just culture.Mulder S, de Rooy D.

One of the most commonly used classes of medications to treat mental health disorders is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Here we present a descriptive epidemiological review of SSRI use in Army aviators over a 10-yr period.METHODS: An archival dataset retrieved from the U.S. Army Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office covering the years 2005 to 2015 was queried for cases of SSRI use. Frequencies were generated by primary diagnoses and aeromedical disposition for the SSRI subset of data.RESULTS: A total of 114 unique cases of SSRI use were identified (122 total aeromedical outcomes). These cases included 41 waiver recommendations, 59 suspension recommendations, and 22 cases of waiver continuations. The top five most common primary diagnoses were depressive disorder (N 32), anxiety state (N 21), posttraumatic stress disorder (N 16), single major depressive episode (N 13), and adjustment disorder with depressed mood (N12).DISCUSSION: Understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of mental health disorders particularly within the safety-focused and unforgiving aviation environment has continued to evolve. With the application of evidence-based policy, deliberate aeromedical decision-making, and methodical risk mitigation, SSRI use does have a place within aviation. Aviators suffering in silence with deleterious impact to performance and safety or aircrew seeking services on the outside without knowledge or oversight of certification authorities must remain in the past.Kelley AM, Bernhardt K, McPherson M, Persson JL, Gaydos SJ.

Cost savings and flight safety are also key factors in UPA implementation considerations. It is important to understand aviation pilot perceptions and intentions towards this emerging technology. The public will look to pilots, as subject matter experts, for guidance as to the safety and value of UPA technology. As such, pilot acceptance is a strong indicator as to the viability of successful introduction of unmanned passenger flight systems. To date, no study was found that has examined how the relationship between aviation pilots and acceptance of this emerging technology might be affected by factors such as experience, media influence, and the perceived usefulness of the technology. Utilizing the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology constructs, this paper describes a quantitative experiment in which aviation pilots were questioned via electronic survey as to their acceptance of unmanned passenger aircraft (UPA). Acceptance of the technology was based on their perceptions and intentions around this technology. Data were collected from aviation pilot respondents in the United States. The results were definitive; there was a significant difference in intention to use UPA technology based on demographic variables including experience and perceived usefulness. By determining which variables affect pilots’ perceptions and intentions around UPA technology, aviation interests can address pilot concerns more effectively and well in advance of UPA implementation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2450421028?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2Fvl4XMWKqYVlgdkbJA%2FDQOcxMMw%3D",""

The query method involves an embedded guided, sentence generation task requiring elaboration of key concepts in the training material that encourages learners to 'stop and think' about the information already presented before proceeding to new concepts. This study also investigated the effect of varying the level of elaboration (low or high) prompted by the queries. Fifty-one undergraduate students from the general psychology department subject pool at a major university in the southeastern United States received instruction on the basic principles of flight via one of three versions of a computer-based tutorial (no query, low-level elaboration query, or high-level elaboration query). Participants had no prior knowledge or previous experience with the aviation domain. A one-way between-groups design was employed, with the query method serving as the independent variable and a sample size of 17 per condition. Dependent variables included knowledge organization, knowledge acquisition, and instructional efficiency. Overall, results showed that incorporating low-level elaboration queries into the training resulted in improved organization, integration, and application of task-relevant knowledge and higher instructional efficiency. High-level elaboration queries consistently failed to produce significantly better post-training outcomes, possibly due to the increased cognitive load imposed on learners during training.

However, the pandemic has also afflicted the mental health of the population at large in the domains of anxiety and sleep disruption, potentially interfering with cognitive function. From an aviation perspective, safely operating an aircraft requires an airmans cognitive engagement for: 1) situational awareness, 2) spatial orientation, and 3) avionics programming. Since impaired cognitive function could interfere with such tasks, the current study was undertaken to determine if flight safety for a cohort of single engine, piston-powered light airplanes was adversely affected during a period of the pandemic (MarchOctober 2020) prior to U.S. approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine.METHODS: Airplane accidents were per the National Transportation Safety Board Access database. Fleet times were derived using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. Statistics used Poisson distributions, Chi-squared/Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests.RESULTS: Little difference in accident rate was evident between the pandemic period (MarchOctober 2020) and the preceding (JanuaryFebruary) months (19 and 22 mishaps/100,000 h, respectively). Similarly, a proportional comparison of accidents occurring in 2020 with those for the corresponding months in 2019 failed to show over-representation of mishaps during the pandemic. Although a trend to a higher injury severity (43% vs. 34% serious/fatal injuries) was evident for pandemic-period mishaps, the proportional difference was not statistically significant when referencing the corresponding months in 2019.CONCLUSION: Surprisingly, using accidents as an outcome, the study herein shows little evidence of diminished flight safety for light aircraft operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.Boyd DD.

Proton pump inhibitors are well-tolerated but are only effective in one half of cases. Second-line treatments, including tricyclic antidepressants, are associated with drowsiness and are not routinely approved for use in aviators. We present a case of a Naval Flight Officer with functional dyspepsia who was successfully treated with amitriptyline and returned to flying status.CASE REPORT: A 23-yr-old male Naval Flight Officer presented with postprandial fullness and epigastric pain. His symptoms were refractory to trials of acid suppression and lifestyle modification. An extensive evaluation by Gastroenterology, including upper endoscopy, did not reveal an organic cause of his symptoms and he was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. The patient’s symptoms resolved with a trial of amitriptyline. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no medication effect on cognitive performance. A waiver to resume flying duties on amitriptyline was submitted to the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute and was approved.DISCUSSION: We present the second known waiver issued in U.S. Naval aviation history for the use of amitriptyline to treat a gastrointestinal disorder. Amitriptyline is not commonly waived due to the potential for unacceptable cognitive side-effects in the flight environment. However, neuropsychological testing to assess for a possible medication effect on performance can be used to inform an aeromedical disposition and, in this case, allowed for a return to flight status.Crutcher R, Kolasinski N.

Spatial filtering had opposite effects on faces and airplanes that were modulated by categorization level. The absence of low frequencies impaired the categorization of faces similarly at both levels, whereas the absence of high frequencies was inconsequential throughout. In contrast, basic-level categorization of airplanes was equally impaired by the absence of either low or high frequencies, whereas at the subordinate level, the absence of high frequencies had more deleterious effects. These data suggest that categorization of faces either at the basic level or by race is based primarily on their global shape but also on the configuration of details. By contrast, basic-level categorization of objects is based on their global shape, whereas category-specific diagnostic details determine the information needed for their subordinate categorization. The authors conclude that the entry point in visual recognition is flexible and determined conjointly by the stimulus category and the level of categorization, which reflects the observer's recognition goal.

Eighteen commercial pilots voluntarily participated in a 2-day training course on QCT followed by 2 months of self-regulated QCT practicing during controlled rest in the flight deck and day-to day life. There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots’ psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots’ mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique. Practitioner summary: QCT breathing has been proven to increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental/physical capacity and sustaining positive emotions to deal with the challenges both on the flight deck and in everyday life.HIGHLIGHTSPilots have suffered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across many factors including social, economic, mental, physical, emotional, and operational issuesBiofeedback training can increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental and physical capacitySelf-regulated practicing QCT to form a habitual behaviour is required to sustain the maximum benefits either in the flight or day-to-day lifeQCT is an effective intervention for aviation authorities and airline operators to develop peer support programs to increase pilots’ fatigue resilience","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2840088896?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=SpZSwdRSXuuxBzcTv%2FFmNoxQw6o%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2022.2139416"

This study seeks to record and classify the incidents of delinquency occurring in the international arena by investigating similar incidents and studying relevant cases. The data are derived from interviews of people who have been working for years as flight attendants on airplanes managing similar incidents as well as recording, classifying, and studying incidents as reported by the international media. The results show the occurrence of all kinds of airplane delinquency, such as drunkenness, theft, drug abuse, obscene behavior, domestic violence, etc. occurring among all persons on board (passengers, crew members). Due to the lack of systematic aircraft surveys concerning the incidents of delinquent behavior and ways of managing them, in conjunction with the airline, the type of clientele, the seasonality, etc. it is suggested that targeted research should be carried out involving scientists from the fields of social, legal sciences, administration, and psychology so that there is a complete image of the problem and ways of dealing with it.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2713165437?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=X%2FJ6XO4zG2a2sdg0fSiLLAVAjtM%3D","https://doi.org/10.18848/2470-9336/CGP/v05i01/29-41"

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 2012) has been found to be an effective intervention for people who have coped with cancer (Feros et al., 2011). This presentation demonstrates ways that ACT principles can be incorporated into the treatment of anxiety in cancer survivors; the principles are illustrated using a case study of a woman with premorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobia. The 48-year-old married Caucasian female was referred for "" ongoing anxiety. "" She had been diagnosed with breast cancer a year earlier, had recently completed treatment, and was getting diagnostic scans every 6 months. Intake data indicated anxious symptoms, and she endorsed fear of recurrence. She was unable to identify where she derived meaning in life. The patient met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobia, Situational (airplanes), which she reported struggling with for years. Within ACT, the patient was conceptualized as suffering with anxious symptoms that impaired daily functioning and overwhelmed her ability to engage in valued behaviors. She consistently avoided her internal experiences and believed that she needed to "" feel better "" to improve her mental health. The patient was seen for 13 sessions during which ACT-consistent interventions were employed. RESULTS : While the patient continues to experience anxious symptoms and meet criteria for Specific Phobia, her emotional symptoms are manageable. More importantly, she has enriched life by becoming more mindful and accepting of her internal experiences, identifying personal values and goals, and engaging in activities of valued living including a family vacation that necessitated airplane flights. She has terminated this episode of care, requesting periodic maintenance sessions. Recognition that ACT is a suitable and effective treatment for cancer survivors is increasing (Angiola & Bowen, 2013). This case study illustrates the utility of ACT with cancer survivors, and especially highlights how treatment can address both premorbid anxiety disorders and more specific cancer-related worry. This case highlights the need for further research into the specific applications of ACT for cancer survivors. Clinicians interested in acceptance-based therapy approaches may benefit from reviewing a case in which premorbid and cancer-specific anxiety was treated using ACT with good treatment gains.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1503916735?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=sbRfvjxQZV0ksg%2ByEH0Zn050qQQ%3D",""

The current study examined associations between several types of environmental risk factors and PLEs in school-age children, whether these associations were specific to PLEs or generalized to other psychopathology, and examined possible neural mechanisms for significant associations.MethodThe current study used cross-sectional data from 10,328 children 9–10 years old from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Hierarchical linear models examined associations between PLEs and geocoded environmental risk factors and whether associations generalized to internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Mediation models examined evidence of structural magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities (eg, intracranial volume) potentially mediating associations between PLEs and environmental risk factors.ResultsSpecific types of environmental risk factors, namely, measures of urbanicity (eg, drug offense exposure, less perception of neighborhood safety), deprivation (eg, overall deprivation, poverty rate), and lead exposure risk, were associated with PLEs. These associations showed evidence of stronger associations with PLEs than internalizing/externalizing symptoms (especially overall deprivation, poverty, drug offense exposure, and lead exposure risk). There was evidence that brain volume mediated between 11% and 25% of associations of poverty, perception of neighborhood safety, and lead exposure risk with PLEs.ConclusionAlthough in the context of cross-sectional analyses, this evidence is consistent with neural measures partially mediating the association between PLEs and environmental exposures.

Despite this, significant under-reporting of safety concerns occurs. One possible explanation is that because concerns cannot always be reported immediately, the outcome of the concern may influence whether reports are made. In Study 1, participants judged six vignettes in which unsafe acts were described: bad outcomes were judged as more likely to be reported than identical acts with innocuous outcomes. Informing participants that luck may determine whether an outcome is innocuous or bad could increase the reporting of unsafe acts with innocuous outcomes. Although implicit prompts did not increase the likelihood of reporting innocuous outcomes (Study 2), there was evidence that explicit prompts to report safety issues with innocuous outcomes increased the likelihood of reporting. Suggestions for further research and a means to reduce the effect of outcome bias on under-reporting are presented.

Over the years, these aeromedical examinations have grown to include aspects related to mental health, as well as a number of other factors. There are several mental health related conditions which are of concern to the FAA, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. These and other conditions can be grounds for medical disqualification, or additional testing or requirements. As a result, pilots are often wary of reporting their mental health issues. In recent years, aspects related to mental health and flying have become a topic of conversation at collegiate aviation programs across the country. This study highlights collegiate flight students' perceptions and realities associated with anxiety and depression. Results of the survey are examined in the context of four research questions, which guided the researcher's conclusions surrounding mental health within collegiate flight programs. These conclusions centered around the perceived benefit of not disclosing or ignoring mental health related conditions, whether admitting mental health related struggles has a negative impact upon flying careers, what strategies are effective to manage one's mental health, and whether flight students feel the current aeromedical process should be reviewed for possible revision.

According to Nelson and Low (2004), the presence of EI skills development in business and industry has proven critical to the economic vitality of organizational growth in terms of bottom line and increased productivity through improved service delivery and healthy balanced people. The current study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and leadership on organizational excellence. The study attempted to identify underlying results that improved student success outcomes. The evaluation of the EI Professional Development Program was delivered in a strategic emotional learning system. The program was delivered to all students, faculty and staff through workshops and specialized training. The study was conducted through a mixed methods design, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data collection. The Emotional Skills Assessment Process (ESAP) is a 213 item instrument yielding scores on ten EI skills structured around four dimensions and three problematic score indicators (Nelson & Low, 1998). Qualitative and quantitative data were examined to determine the EI skill area scores across five academic program areas: business, medical, networking, electronics, and aviation. Student success rates and employee morale were improved, further, the EI-centric processional development program helped identify benchmarks for continuous programs and organizational improvements. Pre-and post-intervention academic statistics were assessed utilizing Hallmark College's CLASS reporting system. The findings of the study may improve educational instruction and service delivery.

The present study was designed to explore the degree to which these results could be generalized to complex, real-world tasks. The study also examined the relations among performance-based, subjective, and psychophysiological measures of operator workload. Seven male volunteers, enrolled in an instrument flight rule (IFR) aviation course at the University of Illinois, participated in the study. The student pilots flew a series of IFR flight missions in a single-engine, fixed-based simulator. In dual-task conditions subjects were also required to discriminate between two tones differing in frequency and to make an occasional overt response. ERPs time-locked to the tones, subjective effort ratings, and overt performance measures were collected during two separate 45-min flights differing in difficulty. The difficult flight was associated with high subjective effort ratings, as well as increased deviations from the command altitude, heading, and glideslope. The P300 component of the ERP discriminated among levels of task difficulty, decreasing in amplitude with increased task demands. Within-flight demands were examined by dividing each flight into four segments: takeoff, straight and level flight, holding patterns, and landings. The amplitude of the P300 was negatively correlated with deviations from command headings across the flight segments. In sum, the findings provide preliminary evidence for the assertion that ERP components can be employed as metrics of resource allocation in complex, real-world environments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1968028998?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=aNISjK%2BCX%2FbR%2BZrQkzLxnvJZ4eo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/001872088702900203"
"Risk Management by Early Recognition of Warning Signs in Patients in Forensic Psychiatric Care","","Fluttert, Frans; Van Meijel, Berno; Webster, Chris; Nijman, Henk; Bartels, Arnold; Grypdonck, Mieke","Archives of Psychiatric Nursing","Scholarly Journals","","22","4","2008-08-01","Aug 2008","208","","","08839417","","","ENG","To clarify the concept of early recognition for the field of forensic nursing. The concept is based on the proposition that patient behavior deteriorating toward aggression is idiosyncratic but nevertheless reconstructable like a signature. Once reconstructed, this signature can be used to detect early signs of deterioration and thus prevent violent behavior. Early recognition is approached from the perspective of deteriorating behavior. Special attention is paid to the social and interpersonal factors related to the individual behaving violently. From this perspective, the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of the patient can indicate the onset of aggression, and early recognition of these warning signs can help thwart such deterioration. The aviation metaphor of a black box is used to emphasize the importance of attention to early warning signs. Patients in forensic care must draw upon their previous experiences (i.e., their own black boxes) to gain insight into their violent behavior and the warning signals for this. The emphasis is on the cooperation between the patient and the nurse in the application of risk management strategies. The Early Recognition Method provides an approach in which patients and nurses also gradually attune their perspectives on aggressive behavior. The concept of early recognition is important because it extends the idea of early intervention to include enabling patients to control their own behavior. Early recognition has strong practical implications for forensic nurses as it allows them to attenuate aggression by assisting patients with the detection of early warning signs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/200846780?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=MrXCtZdxPKdGbXyrsOVNhX6Dkeo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2007.06.012"

A further goal was to assess the importance of individual operator capabilities when providing adaptive aiding. Psychophysiological measures are useful for monitoring cognitive workload in laboratory and real-world settings. They can be recorded without intruding into task performance and can be analyzed in real time, making them candidates for providing operator functional state estimates. These estimates could be used to determine if and when system intervention should be provided to assist the operator to improve system performance. Adaptive automation was implemented while operators performed an uninhabited aerial vehicle task. Psychophysiological data were collected and an artificial neural network was used to detect periods of high and low mental workload in real time. The high-difficulty task levels used to initiate the adaptive automation were determined separately for each operator, and a group-derived mean difficulty level was also used. Psychophysiologically determined aiding significantly improved performance when compared with the no-aiding conditions. Improvement was greater when adaptive aiding was provided based on individualized criteria rather than on group-derived criteria. The improvements were significantly greater than when the aiding was randomly provided. These results show that psychophysiologically determined operator functional state assessment in real time led to performance improvement when included in closed loop adaptive automation with a complex task. Potential future applications of this research include enhanced workstations using adaptive aiding that would be driven by operator functional state.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/216448923?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=9L4rhSTvXy6mXMFDX%2BgE8ZKJOsc%3D",""

Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers’ urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively. Three candidate biomarkers were selected on the basis of statistical significance, coefficient of variance, and compared with data of the three groups. The results suggest that urine metabolites may provide a complete new clue from biochemistry to understand, monitor, and manage human mental fatigue.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2000248742?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=08c%2FGScwbdsBcrviPFeKLLFGpcQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03421"

To address this gap in the literature and to help helicopter flight schools better understand the incidents of attrition from flight training, this qualitative study investigated student and school-based factors leading to attrition of helicopter pilot students from civilian training programs and how schools can intervene to help raise retention. The researcher interviewed four former helicopter pilot students of one Colorado flight school. Participants were chosen based on holding a private pilot certificate, having stated a goal of an aviation career, and having taken no training flights in the previous six months. Emergent themes from interview data include several linked to retention literature: motivation and interest, financial concerns, family care issues, need for remediation and learning style, social connections, and belonging. Also discussed are themes unique to study participants: safety, depression, responsibility, privilege, and disillusionment. Restoried interview data were scripted as a focus group. Recommendations to school leaders include continuing to research funding opportunities for students, addressing child-care needs, creating social and quasi-social student opportunities, contacting stop out students, creating an inclusive school environment, listening to students, creating individual student timelines, and helping instructors address students' learning styles. This research supports sub-baccalaureate retention research and articulates the individual nature of causes of attrition.

Fitts is widely regarded as founder of the applied field of engineering psychology and the basic field of human performance, both based on a human information processing approach. Gibson founded ecological psychology, a school of thought that runs counter to the information processing approach and adopts a radical empiricist approach to perception and action in natural environments. Despite the origins of their disparate views in applied aviation psychology and each having had major impacts on the field of psychology, Gibson and Fitts seem to have had little contact with each other, and their research traditions have continued primarily along separate paths to this day. In this article, we review the arcs of Fitts's and Gibson's careers, emphasizing similarities and differences historically and theoretically.

As the remarkable benefits of mental skills continue to reach an ever?-growing community of performers, it is surprising that many military organizations, known for their high standards for performance and little tolerance for error, have yet to take full advantage of this type of training. Canada's Air Force (CAF), home to a world?-renowned pilot training program, now finds itself seeking additional tools to empower pilots to achieve consistent, high quality performance under demanding, high stress conditions.The purpose of this research was to explore the psychological skills used by elite Canadian military pilots to perform successfully in this highly demanding occupation. Sixteen in?-depth interviews were conducted with elite Canadian pilots at a CAF base in Saskatchewan. Results indicated that pilots utilized all seven elements of Orlick?'s (2008) Wheel of Excellence over three phases of flight: pre?-flight preparation, mission execution, and post?-flight debriefs. Pilots also drew on elements of the Wheel of Excellence during deployments to combat zones. Effective stress management played an especially important role in this context.

Little has been published regarding aviation subpopulations and how their neuropsychological profiles may differ from general population normative data. This study investigated neuropsychological test results of aeromedical service members to evaluate consistency with general population norms, and to delineate differences between aviation subpopulations.METHODS: Analyses were conducted on demographic variables and test scores of military aviators (N 26) and nonaviator crewmembers (N 36) referred for evaluation due to a clinical problem requiring a waiver for flight status. Performance differences between subsamples were investigated with general linear modeling. Base rates for low scores were described.RESULTS: Mean test scores in both subsamples were 0 to 1 standard deviation (SD) above the general populations means, with the largest discrepancies being found on measures of visuospatial ability (crewmembers) and verbal learning (aviators). Modeling revealed a significant difference between aviators and crewmembers on Trail Making Test Part B, after accounting for education. Aviators produced fewer low scores than crewmembers, even when using education adjusted normative data.DISCUSSION: Results suggest the cognitive profile of aviators is uniquely strong in specific domains, with fewer low scores. The development of aviator-specific norms may enhance sensitivity to cognitive decrements in this population.

Materials and Methods: One hundred forty-eight community residents, after exposure to the aircraft or train crash, were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale, the General Health Questionnaire-28, the Death Anxiety Scale, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the Ways of Coping Checklist. The control group (n = 90) comprised members of the general public, who had not been exposed to the disasters, from another city.  Results: The model showed significant associations between the impact of the disaster and general health problems, which varied depending on where community residents lived in relation to the disaster site, whether they were present when the disaster occurred, and the type of disaster. The model also suggested that death anxiety was associated with type of disaster and neuroticism. The model supported the interactive model in that personality factors interacted with coping strategies in maintaining or generating PTSD and general health problems.  Conclusions: After exposure to technological disasters, community residents could develop PTSD and general health problems; however, increased death anxiety was a separate psychological reaction. The interaction between certain personality traits and coping strategies was one reason for PTSD and general health problems.

To overcome capacity limits of the old Air Traffic Control systems, new technology is currently being developed and introduced. While the current way of conducting air traffic has evolved in a continuous manner, the new technologies are part of a new paradigm that has the potential to completely reform aviation. Under this paradigm, it is envisaged that pilots may engage in surveillance tasks, which poses new demands on coordination between controllers and pilots. This thesis describes basic properties of current and new technology and procedures within civil aviation and the relation to distribution of tasks and responsibilities between pilots and controllers. It is recognised that the current distribution is largely based on the development of technological tools. As new technology allows information in the aviation system to be shared to much greater extent than in the present operational environment, it implies that the basis for present task allocation between controllers and pilots may be challenged. For new technology to be viable, appropriate procedures must be developed to assure safety within the air traffic system. To gain wide insight into current aviation, a multitude of data-collection methods have been applied including interviews, observations, and simulations. Interviews have been performed with controllers from several European countries. Observations have been performed in operational Air Traffic Control as well as operational flight. Observations have also been performed in simulations where some applications of the new technology have been investigated. Questionnaires were distributed to both pilots and controllers in a real-time simulation investigating Free Flight issues. Results show that operational activity is characterised by a large degree of flexibility. In some applications of new technology, certain tools and procedures have been identified that have been regarded inflexible. It is emphasised that continued development should be performed in international cooperation and introduced into operation gradually to minimise shortfalls of training.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/304711153?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Vqksv8TNoP7OikKF9M4v6uQF6hw%3D",""

Pilots were directly affected by these events though it is too early to comprehend the specific psychological and occupational repercussions. While psychologists have written much on the selection of commercial and military aircrew, surprisingly little has been published on the mental health of pilots. They are a unique occupational group in terms of their selection, training, lifestyle, frequent competency and medical checks, as well as the nature and changing demands placed on them. Their 'office' is normally a cramped flight deck on board an aircraft at altitudes of thousands of feet. While some aspects of their job and lifestyle appear attractive to some, their working conditions are, at worst, inhospitable and unpleasant. This paper provides an overview of current research on the mental health of pilots, gathered from a number of different fields and specialities within commercial and military aviation. The review covers their lifestyle, psychological requirements for medical certification, psychological problems amongst air crew, personality factors, disruption to personal relationships, reactions to incidents and accidents, alcohol and drug misuse, suicide by aircraft and environmental challenges. Flight crew should have easy access to psychological support; however, many pilots are distrusting of mental health professionals. Further research is needed to improve an understanding of mental health issues among pilots, especially in order to better understand the psychological impact of the terrorist attacks upon them.

Using a narrative methodology, the paper examines how the childhood dream of flying, referred to as the Phaethon dream, serves as an identity anchor that sustained their occupational identities. When the circumstances of the aviation industry (restructuring, outsourcing, and downsizing) led to extensive lay-offs, this identity anchor functioned in two contrasting ways. Some pilots moved on to retrain and start new careers, without abandoning their occupational identities or relinquishing the dream of flying. Another group of pilots, however, were stuck in occupational limbo waiting to be recalled by their employer, unwilling to forsake this dream and refusing to contemplate a move that would decisively take them out of their pilot seats. The paper's contribution lies in theorizing how a dream originating in childhood, linked to a long-standing archetype of flying and subsequently hardened into a shared occupational fantasy, acts as an identity anchor and how this shapes responses to the trauma of job loss. The paper concludes by linking the Phaethon dream to its mythological counterpart in order to highlight its enduring, shared, and unconscious character.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1553543647?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=a4iYpsvBSCYcM%2F9KUYIzK%2Bwqft8%3D",""

The field of aviation provides a unique opportunity to investigate how perception, action and cognition interact in complex yet controlled ecologically valid environments. We suggest a novel cross-domain approach that combines insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition with a neurophysiological framework to explain patterns of human performance across a variety of aviation contexts. Specifically, we argue that studying the interaction between an agent and the environment, as manifest in the Mirror Neuron system as a neural correlate, is key to understanding complex behavior. We can describe the experience and skills involved with task-relevant actions - like flying an airplane - using brain mechanisms of motor simulation of the observed action. With this direct coupling between perception and action, the automatic implicit nature of the Mirror Neuron system can be harnessed to improve human factor and ergonomics. This analysis offers three areas for future study and application: (1) enhancing flight training by isolating specific agent-environment relations; (2) tracking training progression based on brain signatures of flight expertise; and (3) neuroscientific-inspired ecological design of next-generation human-machine interfaces in flight decks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2140793905?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=5v0qpz7d3IArM77e52XLzDDOByg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/1463922X.2018.1474504"

In this study, 12 main hypotheses related to knowledge sharing and organisational innovation in the questionnaires were considered and data were collected from 295 managers of CAO, and LISREL was used to validate data and examine the hypothesised relationships. The model presented in this study; Personality, expected results, mental norms, perceived behavioural control, structural characteristics, commitment, trust, organisational culture, organisational environment, information, and communication technology were considered as exogenous variables that will directly affect the voluntary sharing of knowledge and demand-based knowledge. Findings showed that personality, subjective norms, structural characteristics, commitment, trust, organisational culture, organisational environment, information, and communication technology positively influenced voluntary knowledge sharing. Moreover, personality, expected results, perceived behavioural control, structural characteristics, trust, organisational culture, information, and communication technology positively influence demand-based knowledge sharing. Finally, findings showed that voluntary knowledge sharing has a stronger influence on organisational innovation and is more important than demand-based knowledge sharing.

This article develops a typology of aviation safety initiatives, applies this to health care, and proposes safety measures that might be adopted more widely. It then presents an economic framework for determining the likely costs and benefits of different patient safety initiatives. This article describes fifteen examples of error countermeasures that are used in public transport aviation, many of which are not routinely used in health care at present. Examples are the sterile cockpit rule, flight envelope protection, the first-names-only rule, and incentivized no-fault reporting. It develops a conceptual schema that is then used to argue why analogous initiatives might be usefully applied to health care and why physicians may resist them. Each example is measured against a set of economic criteria adopted from the taxation literature. The initiatives considered in the article fall into three themes: safety concepts that seek to downplay the role of heroic individuals and instead emphasize the importance of teams and whole organizations; concepts that seek to increase and apply group knowledge of safety information and values; and concepts that promote safety by design. The salient costs to be considered by organizations wishing to adopt these suggestions are the compliance costs to clinicians, the administration costs to the organization, and the costs of behavioral distortions. This article concludes that there is a range of safety initiatives used in commercial aviation that could have a positive impact on patient safety, and that adopting such initiatives may alter the safety culture of health care teams. The desirability of implementing each initiative, however, depends on the projected costs and benefits, which must be assessed for each situation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/858379394?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=hTZG8vFhk%2FgXzkqE3NNsH1CGLfs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00623.x"

To do so, we administered the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). A total of 342 questionnaires were obtained, with the largest respondent age group being 41–50 years. The psychometric properties of the instrument were also evaluated, with an exploratory factor analysis revealing a unidimensional structure that explained 59.23% of the variance. The total score on the standard GHQ-12 was 4.54 ± 3.31 very close to the cut-off point established to determine psychological distress. The score increased among those unemployed and was also higher among pilots on furlough compared to those whose work situation was relatively normal. Furthermore, the reliability measured by the total Cronbach's alpha was above 0.8 of each across all employment status considered. These results show the desirability of conducting periodic psychological distress assessments of pilots so that effective measures can be implemented to ensure their psychological and socio-emotional well-being.

Pilots sleep restrictions and fatigue-risk profiles (e.g., time pressure, late arrivals, minimum rest), sleep problems, fatigue severity, well-being, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and common mental disorders (CMD) were measured and compared for SH and LH pilots.RESULTS: Although SH and LH pilots were scheduled for only 51.465.4% of the legally allowed duty and flight hours, 44.8% of SH pilots reported severe fatigue (FSS 4 to 4.9), and an additional 31.7% high fatigue (FSS 5), compared with 34.7% and 37.3% LH pilots. Considerable sleep problems in 8 nights/mo were reported by 24.6% SH vs. 23.5% LH pilots. Positive depression screenings were reported by 18.1% SH and 19.3% LH pilots. Positive anxiety screenings were reported by 9.6% SH and 5% LH pilots. Of all investigated pilots, 20% reported significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, and 7.23% had positive depression and anxiety screenings. LH pilots reported significantly better well-being than SH pilots.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that even far less duty and flight hours than legally allowed according to flight time limitations lead to high levels of fatigue, sleep problems, and significant mental health issues among pilots. SH pilots were even more affected than LH pilots.

This article uses the concept of discourse associated with Michel Foucault to analyse empirical data from interviews with individuals involved in ab initio pilot training at a European flying college. The analysis illustrates how staff at the training college use the rhetoric of Human Factors to enhance their own contribution and status, without fundamentally changing existing practices. Although this reinforces existing power relations, the Human Factors discourse also potentially empowers a different set of management employees. By illustrating the conflicting values and interests of two sets of managers and trainers at the college, the article is able to demonstrate the negative effects of the new discursive format on male ab initio pilots. It also discusses attitudes to female pilots, contributing to the debate about the ability of management discourses to promote gender equality within commercial organizations.

"The relationship between sense of calling and safety behavior among airline pilots: The role of harmonious safety passion and safety climate","","Xu, Quan; Wu, Yaoliang; Wang, Mengyun; Liu, Bo; Jiang, Junsan; You, Xuqun; Ji, Ming","Safety Science","Scholarly Journals","","150","","2022-06-01","Jun 2022","1","","","0925-7535","","","ENG","Pilot safety behavior plays a crucial role in airlines safety performance and aviation safety, so it is vital to identify factors that may enhance pilot safety behavior and explore their mechanisms. Drawing upon self-determination theory, this study examines whether, how, and when the sense of calling influences pilot safety behavior from the perspective of occupational psychology. Using a sample of 321 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between sense of calling and pilot safety behavior was mediated by harmonious safety passion and moderated by safety climate. The results indicated that the sense of calling had a positive direct effect on pilot safety behavior and that this relationship was partially mediated by harmonious safety passion. Moreover, safety climate negatively moderates the positive relationship between sense of calling and harmonious safety passion as well as the indirect effect of sense of calling on safety behavior via harmonious safety passion. In particular, sense of calling had a stronger effect on harmonious safety passion and a stronger indirect effect on safety behavior when the safety climate was lower. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for aviation safety management practices are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2695089572?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=aROgZRdRy%2FZxXl28K6XRpemVfgc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105718"
"Pilot knowledge of automated flight controls: Implications for designing training based on adult learning principles","","Wise, Matthew A.","ProQuest Dissertations and Theses","Dissertations & Theses","","","","2011-01-01","2011","","","","","","978-1-124-71436-3","ENG","The training for a major airline utilized computer-based training to provide the initial training on automated flight control (AFC). The purpose of this study was to analyze the institutional data collected by the airline on their pilots related to this training in automated flight control. A 30-item knowledge assessment instrument was developed for this descriptive study. In addition, data were gathered on the learning strategy preferences of the pilots using ATLAS. Responses from 321 were secured through a random sampling of the airline's pilots.  This was not a study about the competency of the pilots. Rather, it was an assessment of the current knowledge level of the pilots related to their needs for training related to AFC. For the 30 items in the knowledge assessment, the median number of correct responses was 22 (72%). The 30 items in the knowledge assessment instrument formed five factors:  Interpreting Information from the AFS, Managing the AFS, If-Then Situations, Declarative Knowledge, and Display Indicators. The distribution of learning strategy preferences was significantly different from the norm group for ATLAS with the groups that initiate learning activities in the cognitive domain over-represented. On both the knowledge assessment and learning strategy preferences, almost no meaningful relationships were found with selected demographic and professional variables.  Cluster analysis revealed that four distinct groups of pilots exist related to knowledge of automated flight control. Discriminant analysis indicated that the groups differed in their ability to deal with Observed Change. Those poor at dealing with Observed Change were also weak in the Need to Take Action. Those good at dealing with Observed Change were strong in either declarative knowledge or procedural knowledge.  Conclusions were drawn that: (1) the training for AFC was inadequate; (2) AFC consists of five separate factors; (3) the field of airline pilots  attracts people who initiate learning in the cognitive domain; (4) personal and professional variables do not influence learning about AFC; and (5) four distinct pilot groups exist related to learning about AFC.

"Evaluating differences in cognitive functions and personality traits among air traffic controllers with and without error history","","Hedayati, Sepideh; Sadeghi-Firoozabadi, Vahid; Bagheri, Morteza; Heidari, Mahmoud; Sze, N N","Safety Science","Scholarly Journals","","139","","2021-07-01","Jul 2021","1","","","0925-7535","","","ENG","Given the growing rate of air transportation, it is necessary to consider the safety of the aviation industry. Air traffic control is one of the most sensitive and important jobs in the field of flight safety. Working in such a context requires the use of high levels of cognitive functions, which can be impaired or reduced in speed and accuracy under pressure and stress. Another issue is that cognitive functions interact with non-cognitive factors, one of which is personality traits. Through using a causal-comparative method, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive functions like situational awareness, short-term memory, sustained attention and planning ability, and personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and adventurousness, on air traffic controllers' human error by controlling the effect of age. For this purpose, five tests were selected from the Vienna Test System, namely MR, CORSI, DAUF, TOL-F, and EPP6, to measure controllers' cognitive functions and personality traits. By convenience sampling, 37 controllers from the air control center participated in the tests. Excluding outliers, the groups were as follows: 16 controllers with error history and 15 controllers without error history. To control the effect of age on cognitive functions and personality traits, the groups' data were compared using the covariance analysis. According to the results, there is a difference between groups in situational awareness (sig = 0.008, P ≤ 0.05) and sustained attention (sig = 0.01, P ≤ 0.05), with error-free controllers showing higher scores in these functions. However, in other cognitive functions that were studied, namely short-term memory (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05) and planning ability (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05), no difference was shown between the two groups. Moreover, the study of personality traits showed that controllers with errors differ from controllers without errors (sig = 0.02, P ≤ 0.05), but in emotionality (sig = 0.7, P ≤ 0.05) and adventurousness (sig = 0.6, P ≤ 0.05) there are no differences between the two groups. With these results in mind, efforts can be made to minimize potential errors in sensitive occupations such as air traffic control by using cognitive and personality screening tools.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2553856382?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=wbuMakVY%2Bo4mGT%2B2W2eZt1VlinA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105208"

The main personality characteristics that influence the development of a constructive life position are identified, including: value orientations and motives, life goals and meanings, attitudes towards altruism and optimism, ability to predict the future and make life decisions, choice of strategy for achieving goals, ability to self-determination. The conceptual model of formation of a constructive life position of air transport specialists is presented. To identify indicators and characteristics that affect the process of formation of a constructive life position, the main strategies for achieving personality goals are studied: passive strategy; active-rigid strategy; active-plastic strategy; mixed strategy. The selection of diagnostic tools is made, and the results of empirical research, which showed that modern young men and women need psychological and pedagogical assistance in determining their own constructive life position as a basic, which leads to the feeling of happiness and life satisfaction are presented.

Accident reports follow a standard format providing setting, complication, decision and outcome information. Following the 'predictive features' model, it was hypothesized that expertise would facilitate recall, and that pilots would recall most effectively with the complication feature. Pilot and nonpilot participants read and recalled 4 (Experiment 1) or 8 (Experiment 2) accident reports. With four cases, pilots recalled more than nonpilots, but no difference was found with eight cases. A primacy effect for pattern of recall was found in Experiment 1 with the setting and complication features most effective in triggering case recall. When task difficulty was increased (Experiment 2), the complication feature alone was the most effective. In Experiment 3, we manipulated text structure and found that complication and decision features were better recognized than setting or outcome features by nonpilots. The finding across three studies that the complication feature was consistently the most effective for retrieving aviation accident reports supports the 'predictive features' model.

However, the psychological processes through which risks are initially identified and interpreted in organizations remain unclear. This paper presents a qualitative study of airline flight safety investigators. The interpretive processes, knowledge, and assumptions underlying risk identification in this setting were examined. The findings suggest that risks were initially identified through an interpretive process of finding gaps or inadequacies in investigators' current knowledge. Investigators engaged in interpretive processes that aimed to construct small moments of doubt, where current knowledge was found to be questionable or suspect in some way. These interpretive processes were underpinned by assumptions that organizational knowledge was inherently limited, partial, and fallible. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to theories of organizational sensemaking, decision-making, and expertise, and practices of risk management.

Research within high-risk industries, such as aviation, shipping, and agriculture, has identified the importance of non-technical skills (NTS) in maintaining effective, safe performance and reducing error and injury. However, there is a lack of research evaluating factors that may contribute to NTS attitudes and behaviors. As a first step to address this literature gap, the current study evaluated a range of individual and environmental factors as potential predictors of attitudes toward NTS in agriculture. Method: A sample of 170 farmers from within the United Kingdom and Ireland were surveyed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of personality, stress, attitudes toward safety (safety climate, motivation, and risk), environmental stressors (workload, work-life imbalance), and non-technical skills (team and lone worker). Results: Attitudes toward safety climate, compliance, and motivation showed a significant association with both team-based and lone worker NTS. Conscientiousness correlated positively with the majority of the NTS elements. Multiple regression analysis indicated neuroticism and conscientiousness demonstrated capacity to predict NTS attitudes. Concerns about costs and equipment, attitudes toward safety climate, and safety motivation were also found to be significant predictors of NTS attitudes. Conclusion: The results indicate the utility of individual characteristics and environmental factors when predicting farming NTS attitudes. As a result, these elements could be important when evaluating engagement with NTS and developing NTS training initiatives in agriculture.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2084066296?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=3H7vsqBs8hQZqM6kBu9PKSO3s2w%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2017.1384775"

In both experiments, the concurrent chains were presented on a microcomputer in the form of an air-defense game in which subjects used two radar systems to detect and subsequently destroy enemy aircraft. Access to one of two radar systems was controlled by a pair of independent concurrent variable-interval 60-s schedules with a 4-s changeover delay always in effect. In the terminal link, the appearance of an enemy aircraft was determined by a pair of differentially segmented fixed-time schedules (Experiment 1) or fixed-interval schedules (Experiment 2) of equal overall duration. In Experiment 1, the terminal-link duration was either 20 s or 40 s, and subjects preferred the unsegmented to the segmented intervals. In Experiment 2, the duration was either 10 s or 60 s, and the reinforcement contingencies required responding during the terminal link. Prior to the reinstatement of the initial link, subjects estimated the duration of the terminal-link schedule. Segmentation affected choice in the 60-s conditions but not in the 10-s ones. Preference for the unsegmented schedule was correlated with an overestimation of the durations for the segmented schedules. These results replicated those found in animal experiments and support the notion of increasing the psychological distance to reward by segmenting a time-based schedule of reinforcement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/214830873?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=bY2b2wfKnKG5b9mFJInyCYQ0C80%3D",""

In efforts to alleviate these problems in metropolitan cities, logistics companies plan to introduce a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service called air taxis. These are electric-powered vehicles that would be tested and operated in the forthcoming years by international transportation companies like Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk. Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4. The insights obtained in this paper could assist any air taxi company in providing better customer service when they venture into the market.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2524247177?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=x76Fyg4oFaFPX0p7qy%2BHGDYccsY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05581"

In the detailed accident case analysis, it was found that in five out of the eight cases from the United States, someone knew of prior suicidal ideation before the aircraft assisted fatality. The caveats of standard medico-legal autopsy and accident investigation methods in investigation of suspected aircraft assisted suicides are discussed. It is suggested that a psychological autopsy should be performed in all such cases. Also the social context and possibilities of the prevention of aviation-related suicides were analyzed.

Idaho youth (middle/high school students) participated in four twoday drone workshops in locations across Idaho. Although drone applications are prevalent in many civil operations, including emergency response, hazard monitoring, delivery services, transportation, precision agriculture, public safety, and more, STEM workforce development programs are limited. The iDrone program, an informal STEM activity, was developed to introduce and apply STEM concepts packaged in a large dose of imagination, excitement, and teamwork sprit to inspire the future Idaho STEM workforce. The hands-on drone workshops integrated computer science, technology, engineering, and STEM career education. Students worked in groups to build, program, and fly drones and learned federal regulations and safety guidelines. The students also interacted with local professionals who use drones in their work and were introduced to a variety of drone research applications. Throughout the workshops, the students also shared and explored their own creative ideas for future drone applications and technologies. The preliminary results from student surveys demonstrate that iDrone can improve the preparedness of Idaho youth for college and careers in STEM fields. The developed iDrone curriculum module can be easily transferred and employed to promote a STEM pipeline broadly for K-12 education as well as for continuing education units (CEU) programs, undergraduate curriculums (iDrone X), and for graduate students and professionals (iDrone Pro) in years to come.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2488226834?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=oqdW4cZxbMF%2BgQarzH93YWxJ5js%3D",""

Accident investigation reports continue to highlight the relationship between restricted sleep and poor safety outcomes. However, to date we have a limited understanding of how sleep and HEA interact. A total of 302 sectors of normal airline flight operations were observed by trained observers, and instances of heightened emotional activity were recorded. During the cruise phase of each of these sectors, crew members were asked to calculate the amount of sleep they had obtained in previous 24 and 48h. In the 302 sectors of normal flight operations, 535 instances of HEA were observed. Descriptive analyses of instances of HEA and sleep in the prior 24 and 48h showed a significant relationship between the occurrence of HEA and recent sleep. The relationship between restricted sleep and HEA suggests that there may well be further implications with respect to operational safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/920805353?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=FdOtxbzw0lkhpwceYTCI%2FOAraO0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2011.09.031"

Using data from the population-based National Birth Defects Prevention Study, the authors examined the relation between maternal occupational exposure to aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents and Stoddard solvent during early pregnancy and neural tube defects (NTDs) and orofacial clefts (OFCs).MethodsCases of NTDs (anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocoele) and OFCs (cleft lip plus or minus cleft palate and cleft palate alone) delivered between 1997 and 2002 were identified by birth defect surveillance registries in eight states; non-malformed control infants were selected using birth certificates or hospital records. Maternal solvent exposure was estimated by industrial hygienist review of self-reported occupational histories in combination with a literature-derived exposure database. ORs and 95% CIs for the association between solvent class and each birth defect group and component phenotype were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, folic acid supplement use and smoking.ResultsThe prevalence of exposure to any solvent among mothers of NTD cases (n=511), OFC cases (n=1163) and controls (n=2977) was 13.1%, 9.6% and 8.2%, respectively. Exposure to chlorinated solvents was associated with increased odds of NTDs (OR=1.96, CI 1.34 to 2.87), especially spina bifida (OR=2.26, CI 1.44 to 3.53). No solvent class was strongly associated with OFCs in these data.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that maternal occupational exposure to chlorinated solvents during early pregnancy is positively associated with the prevalence of NTDs in offspring.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1551614012?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=D4eJr2RYNW57Ug6cVxgaaOCC4cE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2011-100245"

The SAQ is an instrument that has been widely applied and understood as valid and trustworthy for mapping employees’ views of their organisation’s safety culture. A confirmative factor analysis of data from a national survey of Norwegian CPSs demonstrated that the modified questionnaire has a factor structure which is internally consistent and matches the structure of the widely used SAQ health care questionnaire.

First, the concept of “risky pilots” is discussed, and the existence of “risky pilots” is verified using a percentage analysis of flight exceedance events. Second, three psychological risk elements for pilots are investigated using an implementation of psychological scales, and the exceedance behaviors of risky pilots are analyzed based on real flight data. Finally, correlation and cluster analyses are used to study the influence of psychological risk elements on the exceedance behaviors of airline transport pilots and their operational performance. The results indicate that approximately one‐third of pilots are more prone to exceedance events than other pilots. A moderate positive linear correlation (R [44] = 0.400; p < .05) existed between hazardous attitudes and severe exceedance rates. For pilots with a high level of risk psychology, 86%of their flights were considered “poor” operational performance level. Finally, it is concluded that hazardous attitude is a psychological risk element that has significant negative effects on severe exceedance behaviors of pilots. In addition, the flight operation performance levels of pilots were also affected by the psychological risk level. Furthermore, it is suggested that special training to improve risky hazardous attitudes of pilots should be conducted for the purpose of reducing exceedance behaviors and improving flight performance. These findings are expected to provide support for airlines to identify and manage flight crew risks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2328665383?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=J%2FQR3B6bzzT7LH2q5wa6bAalaGI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/hfm.20816"

One particularly interesting example is that manual rotation actions facilitate mental rotations in the same direction. The present study extends this research in two fundamental ways. First, Experiment 1 demonstrates that not only manual rotations facilitate mental rotations but that mental rotations also facilitate subsequent manual rotations. Second, Experiments 2 and 3 targeted the mechanisms underlying this interplay. Here, manual steering wheel rotations produced salient visual effects, namely the rotation of either a plane or a horizon in an aviation display. The rotation direction of these visual effects either did or did not correspond to the direction of the manual rotation itself. These experiments clearly demonstrate an impact of sensory action effects: Mental rotations facilitate manual rotations with visual effects of the same direction (as the mental rotation), irrespective of the direction of the manual rotation. These findings highlight the importance of effect anticipation in action planning. As such they support the contentions of ideomotor theory and shed new light on the cognitive source of the interplay between visual imagery and motor control.

Participants (n = 141) filled out a diary three times a day for 30 days on their smartphones. Within‐person changes in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) and somatic symptoms after the crash were studied. Additionally, we tested whether between‐person differences in response could be explained by age, baseline personality (NEO‐FFI‐3), and media exposure. The MH17 crash elicited a small within‐person decrease in PA and an increase in NA and somatic symptoms. This response waned after 3 days and returned to baseline at day four. The decrease in PA was larger in more extraverted participants but smaller in those higher on neuroticism or conscientiousness. The NA response was smaller in elderly. Personality did not seem to moderate the NA and somatic response, and neither did media exposure. Dutch participants showed small acute somatic and affective responses up till 3 days to a disaster that they had not directly witnessed. Vicariously experienced disasters can thus elicit affective‐visceral responses indicative of acute stress reactions.

In this paper we examine the security costs and benefits of a trusted traveler program, in which individuals who have been identified as posting less risk than others are allowed to pass through security with reduced security screening. This allows security resources to be shifted from travelers who have been identified as low risk, to the remaining unknown-risk population. However, fears that terrorists may exploit trusted traveler programs have dissuaded adoption of such programs. Our analysis estimates the security performance of a trusted traveler program in the presence of attacker attempts to compromise it. We found that, although these attempts would reduce the maximum potential security benefits of a program, they would not eliminate those benefits in all circumstances.

Project failure reporting is an important, but largely unexploited, source of learning that capitalizes on the learning opportunity of failure provided through the experience of navigating research-implementation ‘spaces’. Learning from others through reading available literature is one way to supplement learning gained through direct experience. Learning vicariously is especially effective when presenting failure as opposed to success experiences. We reviewed the peer-reviewed conservation science literature to identify the extent and characteristics of failed project reporting, focusing our analysis upon social dimensions as opposed to biological causes, which have been comparatively well addressed. We quantified the degree to which articles reported activities commonly applied to learn from failure in business, medicine, the military and commercial aviation. These included activities for identifying, analyzing, correcting and sharing project failures. We used qualitative thematic analysis to identify the social causes of project failure. Reports of failed project experiences are rare and lack standardization. Human dimensions of project failure, such as stakeholder relationships, are more commonly reported than other causes of failure. The peer-reviewed literature has the potential to become a useful repository of lessons learned from failed projects. However, practical challenges such as identifying individuals' cognitive biases, cultivating psychological safety in teams, mainstreaming systemic team learning behaviors, addressing varied leadership styles, and confronting fear of failure in organizational culture must be overcome if conservation professionals are to effectively navigate research-implementation ‘spaces’.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2439399653?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Fwcwp1wRktLV5fiDRNZ6R5SR%2Bn4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108223"

The implementation and evolution of the glass cockpit, however, has happened in an almost ad hoc fashion, meaning that it does not always properly support the flight crew in carrying out their tasks. In such situations, the crew's mental model of what is happening does not always match the real state of affairs. In other words, there is a cognitive mismatch. An initial taxonomy of cognitive mismatches is defined, and the problem illustrated using an example from an aviation accident. Consideration is then given to how cognitive mismatches can be managed. A call is made for the development of an integrated cockpit architecture that takes better account of human capabilities and allows for new developments to be added to the cockpit in a more seamless manner.

Abbreviations, in particular, are difficult to read/process because they are often domain specific. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic expansion of abbreviations by using context and character information. In previous studies dictionaries were used to search for abbreviation expansion candidates (candidates words for original form of abbreviations) to expand abbreviations. We use a corpus with few abbreviations from the same field instead of a dictionary. We calculate the adequacy of abbreviation expansion candidates based on the similarity between the context of the target abbreviation and that of its expansion candidate. The similarity is calculated using a vector space model in which each vector element consists of words surrounding the target abbreviation and those of its expansion candidate. Experiments using approximately 10,000 documents in the field of aviation showed that the accuracy of the proposed method is 10% higher than that of previously developed methods.

Little is known about the best strategy to modify such cognitions following exposure to a technological disaster at the community level. In 1992, a Boeing 747 crashed in a residential area in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Persisting rumours about the possible toxic cargo of the plane led to increasing health concerns among the residents and rescue workers involved in the disaster. The current study investigates (a) the effectiveness of providing information on the health consequences of exposure to the aviation disaster to residents and rescue workers with varying degrees of exposure to the disaster, and (b) individual characteristics which may moderate the effectiveness of the health information provided. A total of 1019 rescue workers and 453 residents involved with varying degrees in the disaster participated in an epidemiological investigation and 1736 rescue workers and 339 residents, all involved, participated in an individual medical examination. Participants were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after communication of the results of the epidemiological study. Main outcome measures evaluated health anxiety, somatic sensitivity, reassurance by a physician, psychopathology, post-traumatic stress symptoms, fatigue and quality of life. All participants reported elevated levels of psychopathology and fatigue, increased anxiety and uncertainties about their health 6 weeks after communication of the study results irrespective of the degree of exposure to the disaster. In particular, the conviction that health complaints were caused by toxic exposure was related to more severe health complaints and worries in both rescue workers and residents. Our study shows that communication about the health consequences of exposure to an aviation disaster at the community level has no symptom reducing or reassuring effects. Tailoring of the communication to individual characteristics such as existing expectancies may enhance its impact.

Per the International Civil Aviation Organization, it is projected airlines will need 350,000 pilots globally. Aims: Due to the demand of pilots, most of the conversations are focused on quantity rather than quality of the workforce. Educators and researchers in several industries have advocated competency-based education in aviation for decades. Method: Members of the research team documented the consensus decision-making process which determined which competencies would be incorporated into the flight program. Results: Six competencies were selected for the hybrid competency-based education model. Teamwork, decision-making, communication, resilience, leadership, and technical excellence were extensively defined for the aviation program. Discussion/Conclusion: Shifting toward a hybrid competency-based education model is challenging within a large flight program.

The first phase of the Augmented Cognition program was to empirically assess the ability of various psychophysiological measures to identify changes in human cognitive activity during task performance in real time. This overview describes the empirical results of a Technical Integration Experiment involving the evaluation of 20 psychophysiological measures from 11 different research groups, including functional Near Infrared imaging, continuous and event-related electrical encephalography, pupil dilation, mouse pressure, body posture, heart rate, and galvanic skin response. These ""cognitive state gauges"" were evaluated on a common, quasi-realistic, military command and control task called the Warship Commander Task. Participants monitored aircraft on a geographical display for their levels of threat and responded to the threatening ones, as they simultaneously monitored ship communications for ship status information. The task involves a combination of perceptual, motor, spatial, auditory, verbal, memory, and decision-making processing. Task load was manipulated by changing the quantity and types of aircraft appearing throughout the primary task and by varying the presence or absence of the secondary verbal-memory task. Eleven of the gauges significantly identified changes in cognitive activity during the task. This overview summarizes the results and examines the prospects for the successful transition of these cognitive state gauges to operational military human-machine systems.

Reports show that gender is one of the risk factors of insomnia, and most Asian flight attendants are female. Therefore, it is necessary to understand insomnia, and the correction to mental health among female flight attendants. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of insomnia in female flight attendants and its association with mental health. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional design. We recruited 412 female flight attendants with more than 3 months of working experience. We collected the socio-demographic and work-related data, measured insomnia and mental health by the Athens Insomnia and Brief Symptom Rating Scales. Descriptive statistics, single-factor analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling were performed to analyze the relationships. RESULTS: There are 45.4% of female flight attendants having insomnia, and 24.8% had suspicious insomnia. The most considerable and serious insomnia problem was falling asleep (15.3%, 4.9%). Factors related to insomnia include smoking, drinking, family load (e.g., housekeeping and caring for family), economic stress and late-night/early morning workdays during last month. Also, insomnia had a direct association with mental health (T  = 17.11, p  < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found that insomnia is negatively correlated with the above factors and mental health. We recommend that airline industries can run their sleep-education programs and provide relevant mental-health-promotion programs for flight attendants.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2903595631?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=7ATkcunRz89b4ckpwRSw8PZVIhQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-220431"

Additionally, we tested whether between-person differences in response could be explained by age, baseline personality (NEO-FFI-3), and media exposure. The MH17 crash elicited a small within-person decrease in PA and an increase in NA and somatic symptoms. This response waned after 3 days and returned to baseline at day four. The decrease in PA was larger in more extraverted participants but smaller in those higher on neuroticism or conscientiousness. The NA response was smaller in elderly. Personality did not seem to moderate the NA and somatic response, and neither did media exposure. Dutch participants showed small acute somatic and affective responses up till 3 days to a disaster that they had not directly witnessed. Vicariously experienced disasters can thus elicit affective-visceral responses indicative of acute stress reactions. Personality and age explained some of the individual differences in this reaction.People can experience disasters vicariously (indirectly) via conversation, social media, radio, and television, even when not directly involved in a disaster. This study examined whether vicarious exposure to the MH17-airplane crash in Ukraine, with 196 Dutch victims, elicited affective and somatic responses in Dutch adults about 2,600 km away, who happened to participate in an ongoing diary study. Participants (n = 141) filled out a diary three times a day for 30 days on their smartphones.

Better understanding how the human will react in these situations, combined with technological enhancements is vital to risk mitigation and ensuring successful performance. This review will also identify gaps in the literature that have yet to be addressed. A systematic literature review was undertaken, beginning with 18,319 articles from three multidisciplinary databases. After careful review and exclusion, a final sample of 22 relevant articles were retained. This analysis was spread across various high risk, sociotechnical industries, including aviation, rail, mining, nuclear power, etc. The findings show that previous research has identified cognitive ability, leadership, situation awareness, personality, and risk perception as the most prominently considered factors in reducing accident involvement. Training, skill, situation awareness, and emotional stability were the most commonly associated factors to success through emergencies. While the research around individual differences impacting success during emergencies is scarce, this review provides future direction on potential factors influencing reduced accident involvement and/or potential factors that could influence a person's success through a disaster or emergency. This information could be implemented in recruitment and training of front-line workers in high-reliability organisations to reduce risk, increase safety and work towards reducing the number of accidents.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2834263499?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=4sSgsrojITsQhgT5%2BEfYMvRbdc8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15006"

This article consequently has a starting point in the notion of 'path dependency' (Schwanen et al., 2011) and an observed 'implementation gap' (Banister and Hickman, 2013), suggesting that significant mitigation policies for transport do not emerge in the European Union because of various interlinked 'transport taboos', i.e. barriers to the design, acceptance and implementation of such transport policies that remain unaddressed as they constitute political risk. The paper argues that without addressing transport taboos, such as highly unequal individual contributions to transport volumes and emissions, social inequality of planned market-based measures, the role of lobbyism, and the various social and psychological functions of mobility, it will remain difficult to achieve significant emission reductions in passenger transport. Yet, transport taboos remain largely ignored among EU policy makers because their discussion would violate 'order', i.e. harm specific interests within neoliberal governance structures and the societal foundations and structures of transport systems built on these.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1627948717?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=mgOScVq6fM5Yfr3wzN%2FsL42sDZU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.07.010"

Measures of WM capacity and LTWM skill served as performance predictors. A criterion measure of task performance was related to the predictor measures. The results indicated that an increase in LTWM skill decreases the role of WM capacity as the determinant of complex task performance, although both measures are important performance predictors.

Previous research with different-sex parent families indicates that helicopter parenting is particularly problematic in emerging adulthood as it may indirectly affect the offspring's mental health through their use of emotional avoidant coping. Knowledge is lacking, however, on the antecedents and consequences of helicopter parenting in lesbian-parent families. The present longitudinal, questionnaire-based study investigated the effect of homophobic stigmatization in adolescence on mental health via helicopter parenting and emotional avoidant coping among 76 (37 females and 39 males) National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study 25-year-old offspring of lesbian parents. All participants were cisgender, born in the USA, and conceived through donor sperm, with the majority being White, heterosexual, highly educated, and no longer living with their parents. Parents who reported that their offspring experienced homophobic stigmatization in adolescence were likely to enact higher helicopter parenting in emerging adulthood. Then, higher scores on helicopter parenting were associated with offspring's greater use of emotional avoidant coping, which in turn negatively affected the mental health of emerging adult offspring. Discussed in light of Bowen's family differentiation theory, the results suggest that clinicians should examine helicopter parenting in the context of lesbian parents' developmental history and potential tendency to project their own concerns about safety onto their child in order to reduce the distress of experienced homophobic stigmatization.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2715834017?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=Kftu4s8KkbgzT18pIPwrmkR297E%3D","https://doi.org/10.1037/fam0001020"

These may include the patient's medical condition, transport accessibility to the accident site and the receiving hospital's resources. Emergency care research is advancing, but little is known about the patient's perspective of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS). Aim: The aim of this study was to describe trauma patients' experiences of HEMS. Method: Thirteen persons (ages 21-76) were interviewed using an interview guide. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Findings: The analysis resulted in three themes: Being distraught and dazed by the event - patients experienced shock and tension, as well as feelings of curiosity and excitement. Being comforted by the caregivers - as the caregivers were present and attentive, they had no need for relatives in the helicopter. Being safe in a restricted environment - the participants' injuries were taken seriously and the caregivers displayed effective teamwork. Conclusion: For trauma patients to be taken seriously and treated as 4worst cases' enables them to trust their caregivers and 'hand themselves over' to their care. HEMS provide additional advantageous circumstances, such as being the sole patient and having proximity to a small, professional team.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2041718551?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=RfwUhWaYMVU102tvKxW6SH5ZyKw%3D",""

Evidence that exposure to aircraft noise is associated with higher psychiatric hospital admission rates is mixed. Some evidence exists of an association between aircraft noise exposure and use of psychotropic medications. People with a pre–existing psychological or psychiatric condition may be more susceptible to the effects of exposure to aircraft noise. Aircraft noise can produce effects on electroencephalogram sleep patterns and cause wakefulness and difficulty in sleeping. Attendances at general practitioners, self–reported health problems and use of medications, have been associated with exposure to aircraft noise, but some findings are inconsistent.Some association between aircraft noise exposure and elevated mean blood pressure has been observed in cross–sectional studies of schoolchildren, but with little confirmation from cohort studies. There is no convincing evidence to suggest that all–cause or cause–specific mortality is increased by exposure to aircraft noise. There is no strong evidence that aircraft noise has significant perinatal effects.Using the World Health Organization definition of health, which includes positive mental and social wellbeing, aircraft noise is responsible for considerable ill–health. However, population–based studies have not found strong evidence that people living near or under aircraft flight paths suffer higher rates of clinical morbidity or mortality as a consequence of exposure to aircraft noise. A dearth of high quality studies in this area precludes drawing substantive conclusions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3066009783?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=XHKkqOwYLo94GYzBQh8ArF3YEy8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.1997.tb01690.x"

We therefore investigated whether noise annoyance predicts depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance in a large, representative sample 5 years later.MethodsWe investigated longitudinal data of N =11 905 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study, a population-based, prospective, single-centre cohort study in mid-Germany (age at baseline 35–74 years). Noise annoyance was assessed at baseline and 5-year follow-up (sources: road traffic, aircraft, railways, industrial, neighbourhood indoor and outdoor noise; and day vs. nighttime). Depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants suffering from depression, anxiety or sleep disturbance at baseline were excluded from the respective multivariate analyses of new onset at follow-up.ResultsGeneral noise annoyance remained stable. Daytime noise annoyance predicted new onset of depressive, anxiety symptoms (also nighttime annoyance) and sleep disturbance (beyond respective baseline scores). Additional predictors were female sex, lower age and low socioeconomic status (SES). Regarding specific sources, daytime baseline aircraft annoyance predicted depression and anxiety. Sleep disturbance was most consistently predicted by neighbourhood annoyance (baseline and follow-up) and follow-up annoyance by aircraft (night) and road traffic (day and night).ConclusionsWe identified current and past noise annoyances as risk factors for mental distress and sleep disturbance. Furthermore, women, younger adults and those with lower SES are particularly susceptible to noise annoyance.

Relative to a non-stress control condition, post-encoding stress in males was found to increase recognition memory for neutral pictures.

This study indicates that stress can improve familiarity-based recognition, thus showing that stress directly increases the strength of the underlying memories.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/849431253?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=iBcfrZ7biAqqxdWWnEXExAL40xs%3D","https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2010.520376"

But little is known about how the processes of categorization stand up to visual complexity. The authors filled this research gap with screening tasks in which participants searched for members of target categories in visual displays. The authors found that when targets were sampled with replacement and repetition, participant screeners relied on recognizing familiar targets and had great difficulty using category-general knowledge. The authors observed a heartbeat in detection performance it improved while test images repeated but dropped sharply when unfamiliar targets from the same categories appeared. This reliance on familiarity illuminates the processes of categorization under conditions of visual complexity and suggests limits on those processes.

Tragically, physicians also have higher suicide rates than the general population. In this commentary, the author discusses his own challenges with mental disorders beginning in early childhood.

With the rise of teamwork comes the need for interventions designed to enhance teamwork effectiveness. Successful teams produce desired outcomes; however, it is critical that team members demonstrate effective processes to achieve these outcomes. Team development interventions (TDIs) increase effective team competencies and processes, thereby leading to improvements in proximal and distal outcomes. The effectiveness of TDIs is evident across domains (e.g., education, health care, military, aviation), and they are applicable in a wide range of settings. To stimulate the adoption and effective use of TDIs, the current article provides a review of four types of evidence-based TDIs including team training, leadership training, team building, and team debriefing. In doing so, we aim to provide psychologists with an understanding of the scientific principles underlying TDIs and their impact on team dynamics. Moreover, we provide evidence-based recommendations regarding how to increase the effectiveness of TDIs as well as a discussion on future research needed within this domain.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2118793692?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=uY%2B9zWTfTbIOO51bJC44fBjny9o%3D",""

Reports show that gender is one of the risk factors of insomnia, and most Asian flight attendants are female. Therefore, it is necessary to understand insomnia, and the correction to mental health among female flight attendants.To investigate the prevalence of insomnia in female flight attendants and its association with mental health.OBJECTIVETo investigate the prevalence of insomnia in female flight attendants and its association with mental health.We used a cross-sectional design. We recruited 412 female flight attendants with more than 3 months of working experience. We collected the socio-demographic and work-related data, measured insomnia and mental health by the Athens Insomnia and Brief Symptom Rating Scales. Descriptive statistics, single-factor analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling were performed to analyze the relationships.METHODSWe used a cross-sectional design.

However, the underlying mechanism of confirmation bias in the context of lost procedures are still unclear.METHODS: This study used scenario-based map-reading tasks to conduct two experiments to explore the mechanism of confirmation bias in the lost procedures. In Experiment 1, 34 undergraduate students and 28 flying cadets were enrolled in a formal experiment to examine the effects of verbal-imagery cognitive style, experience level, and their interaction on confirmation bias. In Experiment 2, we further explored the influence of strategy as a core component of experience on confirmation bias with 26 flying cadets.RESULTS: The study found that individuals were subject to confirmation bias in lost procedures. Visualizers (M = 0.78, SD = 0.75) were almost twice as likely to select the disconfirmatory features than verbalizers (M = 0.37, SD = 0.49). Visualizers exhibited a lower degree of confirmation bias than verbalizers, and experience helps verbalizers to reduce their degree of confirmation bias. The protective effect of experience mainly lies in individuals' choice of strategy.DISCUSSION: Future aviation safety campaigns could be aimed at adopting a candidate selection process that focuses more on psychological attributes by testing for cognitive style, and enriching individual experience through adequate training.

The describing characteristics of these individuals are unclear. Using a sample of respondents (N=20) to the 2016 Australian Sex Survey, we explore some key demographics of those identifying as inanimate objects of modern warfare, and those simply rejecting the possibility of non-binary alternatives. Our archetype analysis delineates participant characteristics into two subpopulations of ""Incel"" and ""Troll"", and identifies key differences in their demographics, personality traits and online behaviours. On average, the study population presents as single Caucasian males, high school educated, with average to low incomes, and some degree of non-heterosexual attraction.

Previous research shows the left-right political spectrum can be explained by differences in preferences for nurturant (Democrats) and disciplinarian (Republican) parenting styles. We extend the theory to another dimension, helicopter versus free range parenting styles. In Study 1, we find parenting attitudes strongly predict paternalistic policy attitudes-more than ideology, party identity, or any other measured demographic variables. In Study 2, we attempt to establish a causal link, but find manipulating preferences for helicopter parenting does not influence policy preferences as Lakoff's model would suggest. In Study 3, we identify a latent variable that predicts preferences for paternalism in parenting, policy, and a host of other domains such as business, medicine, and education. We discuss implications for Lakoff's theory, the political psychology of libertarianism/paternalism, and society at large.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2737162302?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=%2BTQ7Ep45ASeLUKw3wMNVnTw9rkM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001251"

Participants were 239 male flight cadets from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China who completed the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-13, the Work Regulatory Focus Scale, and an indirect measure of unrealistic optimism in risk perception, which measured risk perception for the individual and the risk assumed by other individuals performing the same task. Higher narcissism increased the likelihood of underestimating personal risks, an effect that was mediated by high promotion focus motivation, such that high narcissism led to high promotion focus motivation.

The prevalence of depression experienced by commercial airline pilots in this review ranged from 1.9% to 12.6%. Factors that negatively impacted the mental health of pilots included substance abuse, experiencing verbal or sexual abuse, disruption in sleep circadian rhythms and fatigue.This systematic review identifies that commercial airline pilots may experience depression at least as frequently as the general population. Commercial airline pilots experience occupational stressors, such as disrupted circadian rhythms and fatigue which may increase risks of developing mood disorders. Most studies identified in this review were cross-sectional in nature with substantial limitations. There is a clear need for further higher quality longitudinal studies to better understand the mental health of commercial airline pilots.DISCUSSIONThis systematic review identifies that commercial airline pilots may experience depression at least as frequently as the general population.

Seventeen pilots were assigned to the treatment and control groups matched for accumulated flight hours. The treatment group contained 4 pilots from HC-130 Hercules aircraft and 4 HH-65 Dolphin helicopter pilots; the control group contained 3 pilots of HC-130s and 6 helicopter pilots. During an initial flight, physiological data were recorded on each crewmember and an instructor pilot rated individual crew performance. Eight crewmembers were then taught to regulate their own physiological response levels using Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE). The remaining participants received no training. During a second flight, treatment participants showed significant improvement in performance (rated by the same instructor pilot as in pretests) while controls did not improve.

Pressures were extracted from transcripts in a bottom-up manner and then clustered into themes.Of the 28 pilots, 16 described social psychological pressures on their decision making, specifically, informational social influence, the foot-in-the-door persuasion technique, normalization of deviance, and impression management and self-consistency motives.RESULTSOf the 28 pilots, 16 described social psychological pressures on their decision making, specifically, informational social influence, the foot-in-the-door persuasion technique, normalization of deviance, and impression management and self-consistency motives.We believe accident and incident investigations can benefit from explicit inclusion of common social psychological pressures.CONCLUSIONWe believe accident and incident investigations can benefit from explicit inclusion of common social psychological pressures.We recommend specific ways of incorporating these pressures into theHuman Factors Analysis and Classification System.APPLICATIONWe recommend specific ways of incorporating these pressures into theHuman Factors Analysis and Classification System.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/734130481?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=mNz6TMffXWe1cjmGatubreV19e0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720809343588"

The NTSB determined that 16 were aircraft-assisted suicides; 15 from intentional crashing of an aircraft and 1 from exiting the aircraft while in-flight. All pilots involved in these aircraft-assisted suicides were male, with a median age of 40 years. Seven of the 14 pilots for which specimens were available were positive for disqualifying substances. Based on the few cases conclusively attributed to suicide, death by the intentional crashing of an aircraft appears to be an infrequent and uncommon event.

It was hypothesized that intentional response distortion would either increase towards the end of a long questionnaire, as learning effects might make it easier to adjust responses to a faking good schema, or decrease because applicants' will to distort responses is reduced if the questionnaire lasts long enough. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that certain types of questionnaire content are especially vulnerable to response distortion. Eighty-four pre-selected pilot applicants filled out a questionnaire consisting of 516 items including items from the NEO five factor inventory (NEO FFI), NEO personality inventory revised (NEO PI-R) and business-focused inventory of personality (BIP). The positions of the items were varied within the applicant sample to test if responses are affected by item order, and applicants' response behaviour was additionally compared to that of volunteers. Applicants reported significantly higher mean scores than volunteers, and results provide some evidence of decreased faking tendencies towards the end of the questionnaire.

We then use the SEAS to provide evidence of differential motives for 2 high-risk activities: skydiving and mountaineering. The motive for skydiving is strongly associated with sensation seeking; the motive for mountaineering is strongly associated with emotion regulation and agency but not with sensation seeking (Study 2).

This kind of disorientation has important practical consequences, because a remarkable percentage of plane accidents are related to pilot's optical illusions. An exhaustive review using pubmed and semantic scholar databases was conducted to find out the most frequent optical illusions in aviation pilots.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to review exhaustively and describe the main factors involved in spatial disorientation and optical illusions affecting aviation pilots. Mainly, contextual factors: width of landing track lights, nocturnal operations or low visibility, inclination of the landing track, decline of the ground, size of habitual references, low level approach on the water, black hole, sky/terrain confusion, distortion by climatic factors, autokinesis or autocinetics, optional investment illusion, illusions by vection, false horizon, rain on the windshield, misalignment in the approach, vibrations, somatogravic illusion, coriolis illusion and ""G"" forces.

Stressing factors of aviation and commercial operations can result in pilots' burnout, which is a description of the response to chronic emotional exhaustion and loss of motivation. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout and compare the effects of different coping strategies on burnout levels among commercial pilots in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2023 Methods The study was a cross-sectional survey utilizing an online form of a validated questionnaire administered to pilots of Saudi commercial airlines in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study targeted on-duty Saudi commercial pilots, excluding retired and in-training pilots, with an estimated population of around 2000. A sample size of 311 was determined using an equation considering a 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a 60.3% burnout prevalence rate. Non-probability snowball sampling method was used to achieve sample size. Results A total of 321 pilots were included, mostly Saudis. The participants had a median age of 47, and the majority were married with one to two children. BMI classifications showed high percentages of overweight and obese individuals. The study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout (70.1%). Nationality, marital status, and shorter sleeping duration were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. Common challenges included long duties (79.4%), irregular working hours (72.3%), and time away from home (55.5%). Coping strategies included rest and sleep (81%), exercise (59.2%), and relaxation behaviors (50.5%). Stressors such as long duties, irregular working hours, and work conflicts were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. However, no significant associations were found between coping strategies and burnout levels. Conclusion The study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout. In addition, common challenges included long duties, irregular working hours, and time away from home. The study emphasizes the need to address work-related stressors, implement interventions, and support pilots' mental health. Promoting healthy coping strategies and understanding individual resilience is important. Further research and organizational efforts are required to mitigate burnout and enhance the quality of life for aviation professionals, benefiting both individuals and the industry.Background Many physiological, psychological, and environmental stressors can be experienced by pilots throughout their careers, which may affect their mental and psychological health and their performance consequently. Stressing factors of aviation and commercial operations can result in pilots' burnout, which is a description of the response to chronic emotional exhaustion and loss of motivation. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout and compare the effects of different coping strategies on burnout levels among commercial pilots in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2023 Methods The study was a cross-sectional survey utilizing an online form of a validated questionnaire administered to pilots of Saudi commercial airlines in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study targeted on-duty Saudi commercial pilots, excluding retired and in-training pilots, with an estimated population of around 2000. A sample size of 311 was determined using an equation considering a 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a 60.3% burnout prevalence rate. Non-probability snowball sampling method was used to achieve sample size. Results A total of 321 pilots were included, mostly Saudis. The participants had a median age of 47, and the majority were married with one to two children. BMI classifications showed high percentages of overweight and obese individuals. The study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout (70.1%). Nationality, marital status, and shorter sleeping duration were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. Common challenges included long duties (79.4%), irregular working hours (72.3%), and time away from home (55.5%). Coping strategies included rest and sleep (81%), exercise (59.2%), and relaxation behaviors (50.5%). Stressors such as long duties, irregular working hours, and work conflicts were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. However, no significant associations were found between coping strategies and burnout levels. Conclusion The study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout. In addition, common challenges included long duties, irregular working hours, and time away from home. The study emphasizes the need to address work-related stressors, implement interventions, and support pilots' mental health. Promoting healthy coping strategies and understanding individual resilience is important.

This argument concludes from two premises. First, the RPA pilot faces psychological risk to self by carrying out such an action; second, the RPA pilot is motivated to some significant degree by something other than self-interest. Moreover, I challenge both the view that RPA represent merely an incremental development in technology yielding an incremental expansion of the distance between the war-fighter and the target and the view that RPA is revolutionary in some fundamental sense. I instead argue that, based upon the natural geometric boundary imposed by the earth's shape, RPA have maximized the physical distance between the war-fighter and the target and, over time, this fact will change, not only the psychological effects on the RPA pilot, but also the way we view killing and distance in general. When taken together, these two broad claims, that other-defense can justify killing in war and that there is a psychological cost paid by remote killers, yield a conception of remote killing as an act of sacrifice that will inform the broader conversation about ethics, risk, killing, and RPA.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2019391854?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=uSsbRot6t8Ay2HskuQkotxxEJJ8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/15027570.2018.1440501"

The mean age of the 40 female subjects was 33.0 +/- 6.9 years. The data were gathered by measurements of the circadian rhythms of melatonin excretion and altertness at 2 h intervals in Helsinki (Finland) two days before westward flight to Los Angeles (USA), where the measurements were repeated on the 2nd day after the flights and on the 2nd day in Finland after return flight. This shift in the acrophases of the two circadian rhythms were used as dependent variables in regression analyses. The predictors used were length of day, marital status, amount of physical exercise, age, neuroticism, extroversion, and eveningness. Age, day length, marital status, and physical exercise explained the acrophase adaptation of the melatonin rhythm after westward flight, and day length, neuroticism, and extroversion after eastward flight. Marital status, neuroticism, and physical exercise explained the variation of the acrophase adjustment of the alertness rhythm after westward flight, and age and eveningness after eastward flight.

The data were gathered by measurements of the circadian rhythms of melatonin excretion and altertness at 2 h intervals in Helsinki (Finland) two days before westward flight to Los Angeles (USA), where the measurements were repeated on the 2nd day after the flights and on the 2nd day in Finland after return flight. This shift in the acrophases of the two circadian rhythms were used as dependent variables in regression analyses. The predictors used were length of day, marital status, amount of physical exercise, age, neuroticism, extroversion, and eveningness. Age, day length, marital status, and physical exercise explained the acrophase adaptation of the melatonin rhythm after westward flight, and day length, neuroticism, and extroversion after eastward flight. Marital status, neuroticism, and physical exercise explained the variation of the acrophase adjustment of the alertness rhythm after westward flight, and age and eveningness after eastward flight. It is concluded that the amount of daylight and personality are the best predictors of the circadian rhythm adaptation after transmeridian flights.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/75596044?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=dRCZ7CrxctmKHOj%2FwTVwf2l3eWc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139308967861"

This study investigated the heart rate and anxiety response to parachuting among seven novice and six experienced parachutists. Heart rate was measured from the moment of boarding the aircraft until landing. Anxiety was measured prior to boarding the aircraft. Heart rate was significantly higher among the novice compared to the experienced parachutists, especially during takeoff (125 +/- 11 vs. 95 +/- 17 beats.min-1, respectively), and upon exit or free fall (184 +/- 12 vs. 164 +/- 17 beats.min-1, respectively). However, due to the difference in ages between the groups, when expressed relative to maximal heart rate, there was no difference in the heart rate response between groups (e.g., exit/free fall: 93.0 +/- 5.5% vs. 88.4 +/- 7.8% for novice and experienced, respectively). No statistical differences were observed in the anxiety scores between groups, although the novice parachutists scored somewhat higher (16.0 +/- 3.7 vs. 12.5 +/- 5.7, respectively).

A survey instrument assessed duration and intensity of family-helping activities and psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms, major illness indicators, and social and personality variables at 6 months after the crash and again at the 1-year point for 131 family assistance officers. Results indicate a dose-response effect between exposure measured at time 1 and well-being, symptoms, and illness at time 2. Analysis of covariance findings also show that social supports (work supervisors, family, and friends) modulate the effects of exposure on symptoms and well-being.

These results demonstrate: a) a delayed negative impact of helper stress on family assistance workers, and b) a protective function of social supports and personality hardiness.

A total of 905 active duty U.S. Air Force RPA operators participated in a web-based occupational health assessment. Study findings confirmed that work role strain proved to be strongly related to negative occupational outcomes – increased burnout and reduced job satisfaction. Compelling evidence emerged suggesting that boosting job resources (i.e., team member and leader social support) may be a promising point of intervention to mitigate negative occupational outcomes. By investigating ongoing job demands that result in a higher incidence of burnout and job dissatisfaction, as well as job resources that protect against burnout and job dissatisfaction, researchers and practitioners can continue to introduce supportive resources at crucial points to alleviate the adverse consequences of occupational stress and burnout. Applying the JD-R theory to these findings highlights the importance of job resources for RPA operators and other employees working in high-risk, high-demand career fields. Implications and future directions are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2780288324?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=e6%2BSFVqLw1QcXgIot9sjWG7HP3s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2075019"

Understanding community response to noise involves the measurement of a number of complex acoustic and nonacoustic variables and establishing the chain of relationships between physical exposure, perception, annoyance, and acceptability responses and finally complaint behavior. The perceived loudness of a noise is the most important acoustic parameter influencing annoyance and complaints, and the simple dBA unit can be used to integrate spectral characteristics of complex sounds in community studies. Although energy averaging such as Leq or Ldn can be used to describe multiple noise exposures over time, the variable trade-off relationships between number and level of exposures are somewhat obscured by such summary measures.

Perception of an identical noise exposure can vary according to the physiological noise sensitivity of a person and the activity context in which the noise is heard. Although the acoustic quality of the noise itself usually explains about 10 to 25 per cent of the variability in annoyance responses, sociopsychological variables measured in field studies account for 35 to 50 per cent of the variations in human annoyance responses. Three of the most important nonacoustic factors are the connotative fear effects of the noise signal, the feeling that those responsible for the noise are misfeasant in not reducing the noise, and the feeling that harmful health effects are produced by the noise.

Measures of trust indicated that automated ""novices"" were trusted more than human ""novices""; human ""experts"" were trusted more than automated ""experts."" In Study 2, perceived reliability varied as a function of pedigree, whereas subjective trust was always higher for automation than for humans.

This immunological alteration is correlated with the secretion of noradrenaline during the emotional strain. Quick mobilization of these cytotoxic effector cells is suggested as a major mechanism for the effective adaptation of the immune system to stress situations.Emotional stress is often followed by increased susceptibility to infections.

For the first time, perhaps since the Vietnam War, the entire United States of America was engulfed in a mutual sense of loss and inconsolable grief. 2996 people, a vast number of them unarmed civilians including all the passengers aboard the four hijacked airplanes, lost their lives in what was perceived by many to be the worst terrorist attack of the twenty-first century. Occurrence of such a colossal tragedy has led to producing a large corpus of textual representation of the event including countless novels such as Amy Waldman's The Submission (2012). This study focuses on analysing The Submission by Amy Waldman using the theory of Psychoanalysis to explore the concept of psychological trauma and the effects of PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) on female characters affected by the tragedy of 9/11. The analysis, which is mostly based on Wilson and Keane (2004) and Caruth (2001) psychoanalysis theories, seeks to explore Waldman's perception of the process of healing from the devastating tragedy and psychological trauma of the female characters of the story. It is believed that Waldman's novel does not only portray the trauma of the characters but also presents the path of recovery and overcoming the PTSD of those who were emotionally wounded by the tragedy of 9/11.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1885908103?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=UF3DJLdU%2BZ9pTh154RYYljhqnPg%3D",""

I propose that the problem is not the presence of automation, but rather its inappropriate design. The problem is that the operations under normal operating conditions are performed appropriately, but there is inadequate feedback and interaction with the humans who must control the overall conduct of the task. When the situations exceed the capabilities of the automatic equipment, then the inadequate feedback leads to difficulties for the human controllers. The problem, I suggest, is that the automation is at an intermediate level of intelligence, powerful enough to take over control that used to be done by people, but not powerful enough to handle all abnormalities. Moreover, its level of intelligence is insufficient to provide the continual, appropriate feedback that occurs naturally among human operators. This is the source of the current difficulties. To solve this problem, the automation should either be made less intelligent or more so, but the current level is quite inappropriate. The overall message is that it is possible to reduce error through appropriate design considerations. Appropriate design should assume the existence of error, it should continually provide feedback, it should continually interact with operators in an effective manner, and it should allow for the worst situations possible. What is needed is a soft, compliant technology, not a rigid, formal one.As automation increasingly takes its place in industry, especially high risk industry, it is often blamed for causing harm and increasing the chance of human error when failures do occur.

The principle of institutional balance and the Meroni doctrine are used as EU law parameters for assessing the agencies’ international cooperation mandate, powers and actions, whilst the concepts of ‘international agreement’ and ‘international legal personality’ serve as standards for clarifying the legal nature of EU agencies’ international cooperation instruments and their legal status as global actors.

The article claims that the Airports Commission's endeavours to depoliticise aviation by using ‘reasonable’ methods and impartial judgements—often embodied in Howard Davies himself—have been met with local resistance and political opposition, focussed on the proposal to expand either Heathrow or Gatwick. It exposes how the recourse to expert commissions offers only temporary respite for government responsibility and accountability in the making of hard decisions. It concludes that the inability to secure a binding and acceptable agreement does not just reside at the door of the Airports Commission, but rests also on the failures of political leadership and the ‘missed opportunity’ to articulate a sustainable vision for aviation after the 2010 moratorium on airport expansion in the south‐east of England.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2092386559?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=LyJB2rFt4s3GYMCd4ikHW%2BMneSk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-923X.12520"

Multilevel models indicated that emerging adults who reported less negativity in their relationships with mothers and fathers felt more like adults 3 years later compared with emerging adults with low-quality relationships, while high levels of psychological control and helicopter parenting had detrimental implications for their vocational identity development and perceived competence regarding their transition to adulthood. However, nuanced interactions between parent-child relationship quality and parental control indicated that behavioral control had positive implications for outcomes if it occurred within the context of high-quality relationships, or when utilized with sons. The present study highlights the complex role that parents may play during college students' transition to adulthood, and future work should continue to examine ways that clinicians can incorporate parents as a potential resource for promoting emerging adults' successful transition to adulthood and the workforce.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1980994058?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=thRJvRfglHTlRoukTO1RQSpf0Iw%3D",""

Useful literature was identified regarding anxiety from a variety of fields, including centrifugation, fear of flying, motion sickness, and military operations.Fear of flying is the most extensively studied area, with some supportive evidence from centrifugation studies. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) is as effective as actual training flight exposure (or analog exposure) in mitigation of flight-related anxiety. The addition of other modalities, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback, to VRE improves desensitization compared to VRE alone. Motion sickness-susceptible individuals demonstrate higher trait anxiety than nonsusceptible individuals; for this reason, motion sickness susceptibility questionnaires may be useful measures to identify at-risk individuals. Some military studies indicate that psychiatric history and personality classification may have predictive value in future research. Medication countermeasures consisting of benzodiazepines may quell in-flight anxiety, but do not likely improve anxiety on repeat exposure.RESULTSFear of flying is the most extensively studied area, with some supportive evidence from centrifugation studies.

Nevertheless, the 2-hours-per-day group did slightly better on the symptom questionnaires. In general, sleep disturbance and other side effects were small.A gradually advancing sleep schedule with intermittent morning bright light can be used to advance circadian rhythms before eastward flight and, thus, theoretically, prevent or reduce subsequent jet lag. Given the morning light treatment used here, advancing the sleep schedule 2 hours per day is not better than advancing it 1 hour per day because it was too fast for the advance in circadian rhythms. A diagram is provided to help the traveler plan a preflight schedule.CONCLUSIONSA gradually advancing sleep schedule with intermittent morning bright light can be used to advance circadian rhythms before eastward flight and, thus, theoretically, prevent or reduce subsequent jet lag.

Current literature on executive functions suggests that brain compensatory mechanisms may counter cognitive deterioration due to aging, at least up to certain task load levels. The present study assesses this hypothesis in private pilots engaged in two executive tasks from the standardized CANTAB battery, namely Spatial Working Memory (SWM) and  One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS). Sixty-one pilots from three age groups (young, middle-aged, older) performed these two tasks from low to very high difficulty levels, beyond those reported in previous aging studies. A fNIRS headband measured changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) in the prefrontal cortex. Results confirmed an overall effect of the difficulty level in the three age groups, with a decline in task performance and an increase in prefrontal HbO2 signal. Performance of older relative to younger pilots was impaired in both tasks, with the greatest impairment observed for the highest-load Spatial Working Memory task. Consistent with this behavioral deficit in older pilots, a plateau of prefrontal activity was observed at this highest-load level, suggesting that a ceiling in neural resources was reached. When behavioral performance was either equivalent between age groups or only slightly impaired in the older group, there were not any age-related differences in prefrontal activity. Finally, older pilots with extensive flying experience tend to show better preserved spatial working memory performance when compared to mildly-experienced of the same age group. The present findings are discussed in the frames of HAROLD and CRUNCH theoretical models of cognitive and neural aging, evoking the possibility that piloting expertise may contribute to preserve executive functions throughout adulthood.The effects of aging on cognitive performance must be better understood, especially to protect older individuals who are engaged in risky activities (e.g. aviation).

General similarities and differences in ground-level and aerial encoding have been identified, but little is known about the specific characteristics that differentiate them. One such characteristic is the need to process orientation; ground-level encoding (and navigation) typically requires dynamic orientations, whereas aerial encoding (and map reading) is typically conducted in a fixed orientation. The present study investigated how this factor affected spatial processing by comparing ground-level and aerial encoding to a hybrid condition: aerial-with-turns. Experiment 1 demonstrated that scene recognition was sensitive to both perspective (ground-level or aerial) and orientation (dynamic or fixed). Experiment 2 investigated brain activation during encoding, revealing regions that were preferentially activated perspective as in previous studies (Shelton and Gabrieli in J Neurosci 22:2711-2717, 2002), but also identifying regions that were preferentially activated as a function of the presence or absence of turns.

The study involved 78 volunteer pilots (41 high-maneuverability pilots and 37 bomber and transport aviation pilots). A set of methods was chosen with the possibility of their use according to the principle of comprehensive evaluation of the body functional state under flight loads taken into account. Our results indicate that highly maneuverable aircraft piloting induces a significant activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary system in pilots, compared to bombing and transport aircrafts. This is particularly common to young pilots with the total flying time of less than 1000 h. It has been recorded that changes in adaptation to the effect of flight factors on the body develop with age and flight experience.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2010886285?accountid=16562&bdid=134394&_bd=ElOHha2qiV%2BdxYzrc6wkfHTxs0s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1134/S0362119717070192"

For example, the U.S. military adopted debriefs decades ago to promote learning and performance across the various services. Subsequently, debriefs have been introduced in the medical field, the fire service, aviation, education, and in a variety of organizational training and simulation environments. After a discussion of various purposes for which debriefs have been used, we proceed with a historical review of development of the concepts and use in industries and contexts.

Using visual indicators in darkness, responses to the gondola displacement were recorded with subjects (n = 10) in two positions: sitting-upright, facing-forward versus lying-supine, feet-forwards. Each subject underwent 2×2 6-minute runs.When upright, subjects indicated a tilt of initially 18.8±11.3°, declining with T = 66±37 s. In the supine position (subject's yaw plane coinciding with the plane of gondola displacement) the indicated displacement was negligible (-0.3±4.8°).RESULTWhen upright, subjects indicated a tilt of initially 18.8±11.3°, declining with T = 66±37 s. In the supine position (subject's yaw plane coinciding with the plane of gondola displacement) the indicated displacement was negligible (-0.3±4.8°).Since the canal system is most responsive to stimuli in yaw, these findings are difficult to explain by bottom-up models. Rather, the motion pattern during acceleration would be recognized as a familiar or meaningful whole (entering a co-ordinated turn) only when the subject is upright. Presumably, the degree of familiarity is reflected in the subject's ability to discern and estimate a single stimulus component. Findings are discussed in connection with human factors in aviation and the principles of Gestalt psychology.CONCLUSIONSince the canal system is most responsive to stimuli in yaw, these findings are difficult to explain by bottom-up models.
