This study will explore the change in Chute use before and after 2012 to better understand factors that increased usage and improved accident outcomes. Methods: Using the public National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database from January 1, 2001, through August 31, 2018, a regression model was developed to identify factors that may predict Chute use. Results: In accidents occurring after January 1, 2013, pilots were 5 times more likely to use the Chute, while 2.9 times less likely to use the Chute when the accident involved pilot-related causes.</excerpt>', '<title>Associations of suffering with facets of health and well-being among working adults: longitudinal evidence from two samples</title> <excerpt>Suffering is an experiential state that every person encounters at one time or another, yet little is known about suffering and its consequences for the health and well-being of nonclinical adult populations. In a pair of longitudinal studies, we used two waves of data from garment factory workers (Study 1 [T1: 2017, T2: 2019]: n = 344) and flight attendants (Study 2 [T1: 2017/2018, T2: 2020]: n = 1402) to examine the prospective associations of suffering with 16 outcomes across different domains of health and well-being: physical health, health behavior, mental health, psychological well-being, character strengths, and social well-being.

What qualities are desirable in male and female pilots in combat situations, how do men and women view their career and family goals, and how do men and women work together in day-to-day squadron activities versus deployment and combat situations? Methods: A semi- structured clinical interview sought information about personal/family health, squadron relationships, and career/deployment stresses. The interview covered the effect of grounding for more than 30 d, motivation to fly, health decrements due to aircraft design, teamwork difficulties and blocks to success, career demands, combat and prisoner of war (POW) concerns, stress and coping styles, flying goals, and family/health concerns.</excerpt>"", ""<title>Team task analysis: Differentiating between tasks using team relatedness and team workflow as metrics of team task interdependence</title> <excerpt>Objective: As a constructive replication and extension of Arthur, Edwards, Bell, Villado, and Bennett (2005), the objective of the current study was to further investigate the efficacy of team relatedness and team workflow ratings (along with their composite) as metrics of interdependence.Background: Although an analysis of task and job interdependence has important implications and uses in domains such as job design, selection, and training, the job analysis literature has been slow to develop an effective method to identify team-based tasks and jobs.Method: To achieve the study's objectives, 140 F-16 fighter pilots (35 four-person teams) rated 34 task and activity statements in terms of their team relatedness and team workflow.Results: The results indicated that team relatedness and team workflow effectively differentiated between tasks with varying levels of interdependency (as identified by instructor pilots who served as subject matter experts) within the same job. In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well. © 2012 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society..</excerpt>""]"

However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (eg, tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.Conclusion: We found that while pilots' instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation..</excerpt>""]"

Based on interviews with 41 pilots, we found that two factors–passion for job and professional commitment–which have not been a strong focus in extant research, play critical roles in the processes involved in employee PC breach reactions. We further contribute to the literature by demonstrating when, why, and where perceptions of PC breach influence exit, loyalty, voice, and neglect reactions in a military setting (eg, we found that certain reactions, such as neglect, are restricted due to the potential safety consequences of said reactions).</excerpt>']"

There is a lack of research investigating non-technical skill use during helicopter flight or assessing differences in skills according to mission parameters.</excerpt>', '<title>Predictors of threat and error management: Identification of core nontechnical skills and implications for training systems design</title> <excerpt>In normal flight operations, crews are faced with a variety of external threats and commit a range of errors that have the potential to impact negatively on the safety of airline operations. The effective management of these threats and errors therefore forms an essential element of enhancing performance and minimizing risk. Recent research has reinforced the need to examine a range of nontechnical or crew resource management skills that form threat and error countermeasures.</excerpt>', '<title>Cognitive functions and performance shaping factors in aviation accidents and incidents</title> <excerpt>Is the difference between an accident and an incident merely a matter of luck, or are there significant differences in terms of flight crew performance and associated performance shaping factors (PSFs)? This study obtained self-report data from a sample of 1,144 New Zealand pilots. There were differences between accident- and incident-involved pilots in terms of age, flight experience, and involvement in hazardous events. Incidents were more likely to be attributed to failures to detect or diagnose information, whereas accidents were more likely to be attributed to failures to choose an appropriate goal or strategy.</excerpt>']"
