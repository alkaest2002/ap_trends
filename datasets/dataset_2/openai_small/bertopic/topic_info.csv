Objective: Earlier research focused on military, commercial, and trainee pilots; the present study of business aviation examines not only pilots but also maintenance technicians, cabin attendants, schedulers, and directors of aviation who fly, maintain, and manage corporate jets. Results: The findings compare the resulting profile(s) with output from previous studies; throw additional light on the “boomerang effect” in CRM training and other unresolved issues and ambiguities in existing knowledge; and suggest directions for further research, including refined methods and broadened uses for psychological assessments in and beyond the selection process.</excerpt>', '<title>Rumination and psychological resilience in Chinese civil aviation flight students: the chain mediating role of proactive coping and generalized anxiety disorder</title> <excerpt>Background: As the focus of aviation safety shifts from technology to human factors, the central role of psychological resilience in flight safety has become increasingly prominent. However, the internal mechanism of how rumination affects psychological resilience, particularly the chain mediating effect of proactive coping and generalized anxiety, has not been thoroughly explored in high-stress populations. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, 1,235 flight students from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China were surveyed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to gather data.</excerpt>', '<title>Social acceptance of increased usage of the ballistic parachute system in a general aviation aircraft</title> <excerpt>Background: An airframe parachute (""Chute"") available in certain aircraft is designed to lower the airplane safely to the ground for emergency situations that occur 500 ft (152 m) above ground level (AGL): the ""Chute altitude envelope."" This study will explore the change in Chute use before and after 2012 to better understand factors that increased usage and improved accident outcomes. Methods: Using the public National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database from January 1, 2001, through August 31, 2018, a regression model was developed to identify factors that may predict Chute use. Results: In accidents occurring after January 1, 2013, pilots were 5 times more likely to use the Chute, while 2.9 times less likely to use the Chute when the accident involved pilot-related causes.</excerpt>', '<title>Psychiatric considerations in military aerospace medicine</title> <excerpt>Military aerospace medicine requires a psychiatric selection and certification process that determines not only the absence of significant mental disorders, but also the presence of positive qualities in the realms of motivation, ability and stability: not all normal people are fit to fly. Other issues of aerospace psychiatry involve maintenance of mental resilience and hardiness during a flying career, aeromedical decisions about when to remove from flight duties and when to return, criteria for waivers for psychiatric conditions, use of medications for treatment of psychiatric symptoms, questions of substance abuse, and research in such areas as genetics.

What qualities are desirable in male and female pilots in combat situations, how do men and women view their career and family goals, and how do men and women work together in day-to-day squadron activities versus deployment and combat situations?

When analyzing and assessing the reliability of this system, it is important to consider ethical aspects, because they concern human relations, permeating its very component and in the long run determining its efficiency. Psychological and medical examinations before, during and after manned missions have helped us to identify the major points of interaction of the subsystems which require adequate monitoring and optimization using socio-psychological and organization-technical approaches: arrangement and evaluation of the quality of work, arrangement of proper leisure, psychological comfort in the interpersonality and intergroup relations during prolonged space missions.</excerpt>', '<title>Crewmember and ground personnel interactions over time during Shuttle/Mir space missions</title> <excerpt>Background: Anecdotal reports from space and results from simulation studies on Earth have suggested that space crewmembers may experience decrements in their mood and interpersonal environment during the 2nd hall of the mission and that negative emotions may be displaced to outside monitoring personnel. Methods: To evaluate these issues, we studied 5 American astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 American and 16 Russian mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir space program.

This leaves little room for learning about how human roles have shifted in automated cockpits or how the distinction between technical and nontechnical skills has become blurred when managing the flight path of an automated aircraft.

Background: Although technology has long been an irreplaceable, valuable ally for airline pilots, artificial intelligence (AI) differs significantly from previously used technologies and pilots perceive AI not only as a tool but as an agent with human-like attributes.

However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (eg, tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.Conclusion: We found that while pilots' instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation..</excerpt>""]"

Another problem taken into consideration is the disorientation that, particularly during helicopter flights, the pilot may experience whenever there is a conflict between his own sensorial evaluations and the information supplied by the instruments.</excerpt>', '<title>Application of rTMS to the Motor Cortex in a Patient with Startle Reaction: A Case Report</title> <excerpt>Startle reaction is a physiological muscle reaction that occurs to protect against an unexpected, sudden stimulus.
