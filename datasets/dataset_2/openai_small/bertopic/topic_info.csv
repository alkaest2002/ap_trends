However, the internal mechanism of how rumination affects psychological resilience, particularly the chain mediating effect of proactive coping and generalized anxiety, has not been thoroughly explored in high-stress populations. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, 1,235 flight students from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China were surveyed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to gather data.</excerpt>', ""<title>The “Break-Off” Phenomenon: A Precipitant of Anxiety in Jet Aviators</title> <excerpt>Icarus, flushed with excitement and exhilaration, soared even higher toward the sun—despite the cries and warnings of his father.

In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well. © 2012 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society..</excerpt>""]"

Grounded in the job demands–resources (JD-R) model and social exchange theory (SET), we propose and test a sequential mediation model in which rapport is positively associated with trust, trust is positively associated with PsyCap, and PsyCap is positively associated with OCB. Based on survey data from 248 South Korean flight attendants, structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrates that rapport is indirectly associated with OCB through the sequential mediation of trust and PsyCap, rather than displaying a significant direct association.</excerpt>']"

However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (eg, tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.Conclusion: We found that while pilots' instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation..</excerpt>"", '<title>Anthropomorphic AI: Sociopathic AI Features as Predictors of Career Opportunities and Threats Perceived by Pilots in Commercial Aviation</title> <excerpt>Objective: The study aims to investigate how anthropomorphic, particularly sociopathic, features ascribed to AI affect commercial pilots’ perceptions of career threats, opportunities, and performance benefits of AI integration in the cockpit.

Vital services such as police, ambulance, hospitals, electricity must be maintained 24 hours a day; expensive equipment is more profitable if used continuously; machinery such as furnaces may be damaged if shut down.Work patterns which conflict with our circadian rhythms may produce fatigue, a tendency to make errors, accident-proneness, 'jet-lag' and perhaps ill health.Those most at risk are shiftworkers and aircrew: whilst the latter must cope with changing shift patterns and time-zone changes, the former are required to adapt to changes in work/sleep patterns against an environmental background disruptive to such an adaptation.More difficulties arise when we consider those with chronic health problems since employees on long-term medication may not be able to reconcile an unvarying drug regimen to an ever-changing work pattern. Furthermore, there is evidence that the potency of drugs may vary according to the time of administration.There is much to be learned about the health effects of shiftwork; here we review what is known.</excerpt>""]"

Some theories argue for scalability by making the implicit assumption that complex tasks consist of many smaller parts, which are learned according to basic learning principles. Surprisingly, there has been rather sparse empirical testing of this crucial assumption. In this article, we examine this assumption directly by decomposing the learning in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air-Traffic Controller Task (Ackerman, 1988) from the learning at the global level all the way down to the learning at the keystroke level.</excerpt>']"

Since individuals who are unable to sustain attention under low task-load conditions would appear to be more likely to commit errors and be less able to handle a sudden emergency situation, it would seem desirable to examine the characteristics of individuals unable to sustain attention under these conditions.

The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions. While PPP was poorer in the SART than in the TVF, that result could be accounted for by a loss of motor control rather than a lack of mindfulness.</excerpt>']"

Employing an exploratory, concurrent, mixed-methods design with an electronic survey consisting of several valid instruments and single, face-to-face interviews; data were gathered from 119 surveys and 22 interviews. Four qualitative themes aligned with the Post-Deployment Readjustment Inventory items.</excerpt>', ""<title>Impact of Combat Deployment on Psychological and Relationship Health: A Longitudinal Study</title> <excerpt>Although previous research has indicated an elevated prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems among veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom following deployment, most of this research has been cross-sectional and has focused on a limited range of military groups and outcome criteria. This investigation was a longitudinal study of U.S. Air Force security forces assigned to a year-long high-threat ground mission in Iraq to determine the degree to which airmen's emotional and behavioral health and committed relationships were adversely impacted by an extended deployment to a warzone.</excerpt>"", '<title>Self-concept Changes Related to War Captivity</title> <excerpt>A questionnaire was mailed to all US Air Force repatriated prisoners of the Vietnam war (POWs) still on active duty, and to matched controls, in the fall of 1976. Results were analyzed to determine long-term consequences of the war imprisonment experience. We hypothesized that individuals experiencing the greatest stress and frustration might believe they gained more psychologically than those less stressed.</excerpt>']"

Aerospace psychiatrists have multiple, sometimes conflicting, responsibilities to the organization and society (the social control task) and to the individual aviator (the humanistic and medical tasks).

In an idealized flight operation that has become real thanks to the implementation of more and more sophisticated tools, Air Force personnel must deal with the dangers inherent in an aeronautical environment. These specific constraints (the decrease of atmospheric pressure, constraints related to the aircraft, equipment and mission) justify an adaptation of the current medical-psychological training in the armed forces.</excerpt>"", ""<title>The flight surgeon and psychiatry: Interest and skills</title> <excerpt>Much of the flight surgeon's day-to-day clinical practice involves the use of psychiatric skills in the assessment and management of the problems of flyers and their families.

Three points of pilots' psychology are developed: 1) the pilot's body as the source of intense sensations and as an object of important value; 2) the libidinal, narcissistic, and defensive aspects of the pilot's spirit; and 3) the pilot's environment with its characteristic relationships.</excerpt>""]"
