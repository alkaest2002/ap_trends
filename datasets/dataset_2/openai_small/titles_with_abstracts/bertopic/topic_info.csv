The results demonstrate that ATCOs’ visual scan patterns had significant differences between acoustic and semantic designs. ATCOs established different eye movement patterns on fixations number, fixation duration and saccade velocity. Effective decision support systems require human-centered design with effective stimuli to direct ATCO’s attention to critical events. It is necessary to provide ATCOs with specific alerting information to reflect the nature of the critical situation in order to minimise the side effects of startle and inattentional deafness. Consequently, the design of a semantic alert can significantly reduce ATCOs’ response time, therefore providing valuable extra time in a time-limited situation to formulate and execute resolution strategies in critical air safety events. The findings of this research indicate that the context-specified design of semantic alerts could improve ATCO’s situational awareness and significantly reduce response time in the event of Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activation which alerts to two aircraft having less than the required lateral or vertical separation. Practitioner Summary: Eye movements are closely linked with visual attention and can be analysed to explore shifting attention whilst performing monitoring tasks. This research has found that context-specific designed semantic alerts facilitated improved ATCO cognitive processing by integrating visual and auditory resources. Semantic designs have been demonstrated to be superior to acoustic design by directing the operator’s attention more quickly to critical situations.Abbreviations: APW: area proximity warning; ASRS: aviation safety reporting system; ATC: air traffic control; ATCO: air traffic controller; ATM: air traffic management; COOPANS: cooperation between air navigation service providers; HCI: human-computer interaction; IAA: irish aviation authority; MSAW: minimum safe altitude warning; MTCD: medium-term conflict detection; SA: situation awareness; STCA: short term conflict alert; TP: trajectory prediction. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>', '<title>Evidence-based fitness-to-fly assessment for military aviators with untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysms: A 5-year retrospective at a single center</title> <abstract>The increasing detection of untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in military aviators poses a challenge for aeromedical clearance. This study aimed to introduce the fitness-to-fly criteria for military aviators with UIAs in our center and try to develop evidence-based aeromedical guidelines.\xa0We retrospectively reviewed active-duty military aviators diagnosed as UIAs by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in a single center between 2019 and 2024. A multidisciplinary team performed comprehensive rupture risk stratification to determine patients for intervention. Afterwards, a dedicated aeromedical review board evaluated in-flight incapacitation risk and flight eligibility in the non-intervention group. Clinical features, aneurysm characteristics (size, location, morphology) and the final aeromedical disposition of these untreated cases were reported and analyzed.\xa0Twenty-three active-duty military aviators were diagnosed with UIAs by DSA at our institution over a 5-year period. Seven patients underwent intervention, whereas 16 were placed under conservative surveillance. All conservatively managed cases involved male aviators (mean age: 36 years) with small (< 5\xa0mm), saccular UIAs, primarily in the paraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) segments (68.8%). None had hypertension or smoking history. The estimated annual rupture risk was < 0.5% for small paraclinoid aneurysms and nearly 0% for cavernous ICA aneurysms. Therefore, flight clearance was granted with operational restrictions for 11 pilots with small paraclinoid aneurysms (dual-seat or captaincy duties), while 5 with cavernous ICA aneurysms received unrestricted certification. Annual case-by-case inspections, along with MRA surveillance and psychological support, are required.\xa0This study represents one of the largest real-world practice of aeromedical certification for untreated UIAs. The annual rupture risk is extremely low (< 0.5%) for small saccular aneurysms located at the medial wall of the paraclinoid segment and nearly negligible for those in the cavernous segment of the ICA. Granting flight qualification to military personnel with such aneurysms is medically appropriate, provided enhanced surveillance protocols are implemented. Our protocol maximizes retention of experienced aircrew while ensuring operational safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>', ""<title>Circadian adaptation of airline pilots during extended duration operations between the USA and Asia</title> <abstract>This study tracked circadian adaptation among airline pilots before, during, and after trips where they flew from Seattle (SEA) or Los Angeles (LAX) to Asia (7-9 time zones westward), spent 7-12d in Asia, and then flew back to the USA. In Asia, pilots' exposures to local time cues and sleep opportunities were constrained by duty (short-haul flights crossing 1 time zone/24h). Fourteen captains and 16 first officers participated (median age=56 versus 48 yrs, p.U)<0.001). Their sleep was monitored (actigraphy, duty/sleep diaries) from 3d pre-trip to 5d post-trip. For every flight, Karolinska Sleepiness and Samn-Perelli Fatigue scales and 5-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) tests were completed pre-flight and at top of descent (TOD). Participants had 3 d free of duty prior to outbound flight(s). From 72-24h prior to departure (baseline sleep), mean total sleep/24h (TST)=7.00h (SD=1.18h) and mean sleep efficiency=87% (SD=4.9%). Most pilots (23/30) flew direct to and from Asia, but 7 LAX-based pilots flew via a 1-d layover in Honolulu (HNL). On flights with 2 pilots, mean total in-flight sleep varied from 0.40 to 2.09h outbound and from 0.74 to 1.88h inbound. Duty patterns in Asia were variable, with 2 flights/d (mean flight duration=3.53h, SD=0.53h). TST on days 1Â-7 in Asia did not differ from baseline (p.F)=0.2031). However, mean sleep efficiency was significantly lower than baseline on days 5-7 (p.F)=0.0041). More pilots were on duty between 20:00 and 24:00h on days 5Â-7 (mean=21%) than on days 2Â-4 (mean=14%). Sleep propensity distribution phase markers and chi-square periodogram analyses suggest that adaptation to local time was complete by day 4 in Asia. On pre-flight PVT tests in Asia, the slowest 10% of responses improved for flights departing 14:00-19:59h (p.F)=0.0484). At TOD, the slowest 10% of responses improved across days for flights arriving 14:00-19:59h (p.F)=0.0349) and 20:00-01:59h (p.F)=0.0379). Sleepiness and fatigue ratings pre-flight and at TOD did not change across days in Asia. TST on post-trip day 1 was longer than baseline (estimated mean extension=1.68h; adjusted p(t)<0.0001). On all post-trip days, sleep efficiency was comparable to baseline. Sleep propensity distribution phase markers and chi-square periodogram analyses suggest complete readaptation in 1Â-2d. Two opposing influences appeared to affect sleep and PVT performance across days in Asia: progressive circadian adaptation to local time and increasing duty during local night, which displaced sleep from the optimal physiological time. Cumulative sleep restriction across the return flight may explain the large rebound in TST on day 1 post-trip. Thereafter TST, sleep efficiency, and sleep timing suggest that readaptation was complete. Rapid post-trip readaptation may be facilitated by pilots having unconstrained nocturnal sleep opportunities, coupled with stronger patterns of family and social cues than in Asia. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.</abstract>"", ""<title>An exploration of the utility of mathematical modeling predicting fatigue from sleep/wake history and circadian phase applied in accident analysis and prevention: The crash of Comair Flight 5191</title> <abstract>On 27 August 2006 at 0606 eastern daylight time (EDT) at Bluegrass Airport in Lexington, KY (LEX), the flight crew of Comair Flight 5191 inadvertently attempted to take off from a general aviation runway too short for their aircraft. The aircraft crashed killing 49 of the 50 people on board. To better understand this accident and to aid in preventing similar accidents, we applied mathematical modeling predicting fatigue-related degradation in performance for the Air Traffic Controller on-duty at the time of the crash. To provide the necessary input to the model, we attempted to estimate circadian phase and sleep/wake histories for the Captain, First Officer, and Air Traffic Controller. We were able to estimate with confidence the circadian phase for each. We were able to estimate with confidence the sleep/wake history for the Air Traffic Controller, but unable to do this for the Captain and First Officer. Using the sleep/wake history estimates for the Air Traffic Controller as input, the mathematical modeling predicted moderate fatigue-related performance degradation at the time of the crash. This prediction was supported by the presence of what appeared to be fatigue-related behaviors in the Air Traffic Controller during the 30 min prior to and in the minutes after the crash. Our modeling results do not definitively establish fatigue in the Air Traffic Controller as a cause of the accident, rather they suggest that had he been less fatigued he might have detected Comair Flight 5191's lining up on the wrong runway. We were not able to perform a similar analysis for the Captain and First Officer because we were not able to estimate with confidence their sleep/wake histories. Our estimates of sleep/wake history and circadian rhythm phase for the Air Traffic Controller might generalize to other air traffic controllers and to flight crew operating in the early morning hours at LEX. Relative to other times of day, the modeling results suggest an elevated risk of fatigue-related error, incident, or accident in the early morning due to truncated sleep from the early start and adverse circadian phase from the time of day. This in turn suggests that fatigue mitigation targeted to early morning starts might reduce fatigue risk. In summary, this study suggests that mathematical models predicting performance from sleep/wake history and circadian phase are (1) useful in retrospective accident analysis provided reliable sleep/wake histories are available for the accident personnel and, (2) useful in prospective fatigue-risk identification, mitigation, and accident prevention. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.</abstract>"", ""<title>Senior Aviator Medical Qualification Status</title> <abstract>Introduction: Aviation personnel are expensive to train and challenging for the services to retain because of lucrative opportunities in the civilian aviation sector and a desire among pilots for agency. The military services' retention efforts have typically utilized a combination of high continuation pays and longer service commitments of up to 10 years following initial training. One area that the services have overlooked in their attempts to retain senior aviators is quantifying and reducing medical disqualifications. Much as aging aircraft require increasing maintenance to retain full operational capability, so may pilots and other aircrew members. Materials and Methods: This article reports on a prospectively collected cross-sectional research study evaluating the medical status of senior aviation personnel who reported being considered or selected for command. The study was deemed exempt from human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board and a waiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was granted. The study, which collected data at the Pentagon Flight Medical Clinic over 1 year, used a chart review of routine medical encounters and flight physicals to collect descriptive data. The goals of the study were to establish the prevalence of medically disqualifying conditions, assess the association between disqualifying conditions and age, and generate hypotheses for further research. Logistic regression of waiver need was performed for variables including prior waivers, waiver count, service, platform, age, and gender. ANOVA of readiness percentages vs. DoD targets were assessed between the services individually and in aggregate. Results: The study demonstrated medical readiness rates among command-eligible senior aviators ranging from 74% for the Air Force to 40% for the Army with the Navy and Marine Corps in the middle. The sample was insufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in readiness between the services; however, the population as a whole was significantly below the DoD's readiness target of >90% (P =. 000). Conclusions: None of the services met the DoD minimum readiness target of 90%. Markedly higher readiness was observed in the Air Force, the only service with a medical screening incorporated into its command selection process, but this difference was not statistically significant. Waivers increased with age and musculoskeletal concerns were common. A larger prospective cohort study should be considered to further elucidate and confirm the findings of this study. If further research confirms these findings, consideration should be made of screening command applicants for medical readiness. © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

However, limited research supports the improvement of cognitive function and mood state in women. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hypoxia and exercise on working memory and mood state in women. METHODS: There were 15 healthy women (age = 22 ± 2 yr) who completed the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4 th Edition (ANAM), including the Running Memory Continuous Performance Task (RMCPT) and Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) in normoxia (21% O<inf>2</inf> ), at rest in normoxia and hypoxia (12.5% O<inf>2</inf> ), and during cycling exercise at 60% and 40% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> in hypoxia. RESULTS: RMCPT was not significantly impaired at 30 (100.3 ± 17.2) and 60 (96.6 ± 17.3) min rest in hypoxia compared to baseline in normoxia (97.0 ± 17.0). However, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (106.7 ± 20.8) at 60% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia. Following 30 ( - 89.4 ± 48.3) and 60 min of exposure to hypoxia ( - 79.8 ± 55.9) at rest, TMD was impaired compared with baseline ( - 107.1 ± 46.2). TMD was significantly improved during exercise (- 108.5 ± 42.7) at 40% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared with 30 min rest in hypoxia. Also, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (104.0 ± 19.1) at 60% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia (96.6 ± 17.3). DISCUSSION: Hypoxia and an acute bout of exercise partially influence RMCPT and TMD. Furthermore, a moderate-intensity bout of exercise (60%) may be a more potent stimulant for improving cognitive function than low-intensity (40%) exercise. The present data should be considered by aeromedical personnel performing cognitive tasks in hypoxia. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Subjective Symptoms In Hipoxia of Military Aircraft Aircrews, Relationship With Age And Oxygen Saturation: A Cross-Sectional Study</title> <abstract>Introduction: Hypobaric hypoxia is a condition that occurs at altitudes above 25,000 feet, where a decrease in barometric pressure causes reduced oxygen availability. This condition impacts physiological and psychological function, causing symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and decreased oxygen saturation. Although this condition is essential for military aircraft crews who frequently operate at these altitudes, there is a lack of research that explicitly explores its impact, especially regarding subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation. Objective: To evaluate and understand the effect of hypoxia on the subjective symptoms experienced by military aircrew and its effect on their oxygen saturation when operating at high altitudes and determine the relationship of subjective symptoms differentiated by age and saturation. Methods: This is a prospective, controlled, cross-sectional study conducted at a single center, recruiting 64 military aircrew members for a one-time session that includes an intermediate phase and subsequent hypoxia exposure in a high-altitude chamber. Result: The study gathered data on physiological responses to hypobaric conditions at 25,000 feet in a hypobaric chamber, detailing subjective symptoms and reduced oxygen saturation levels during hypoxia at this altitude. Noted hypoxia symptoms included dizziness, tingling, a floating feeling, and memory lapses. Additionally, oxygen saturation levels were observed to drop below 70%. The hypoxia observed in the study was attributed to altitude, with an understanding that higher elevations result in lower partial pressure. Conclusion: These findings conclude that physiological changes in subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation occur in military aircraft crew experiencing hypoxia at an altitude of 25,000 feet. No significant correlation was found between age, saturation and the subjective symptoms experienced, except for muscle weakness, which appears to be more common in individuals over 33 years of age. © 2024 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Learning and novel and complex cognitive tasks involving multiple demands, however, might be impaired. This study evaluated whether complex cognition-as assessed by complex reasoning, multiple memory, and risk judgment-was impaired during mild hypoxia. Using a normobaric single-blind crossover design, 25 healthy nonsmoking male participants breathed normoxic (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.206) or hypoxic air (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.143) equivalent to 2,438 m for 2 hr and performed the following tasks at baseline, 30 min, and 90 min: (a) a complex logical reasoning task that assessed accuracy, response time, and a reasoning quality index for easy (nonconflict valid), difficult (nonconflict invalid), fairly difficult (conflict valid), and very difficult (conflict invalid) syllogisms; (b) a multiple memory test that assessed sentence judgment error, working memory span, and prospective memory; and (c) a simple vigilance psychomotor task that assessed the frequency and mean time that a disc was outside a target area and braking reaction time. They also completed a self-perceived risk judgement questionnaire near the end of each exposure. After 90 min, the mean change in working memory span for mild hypoxia (M = 0.9, SD = 4.6) was significantly less than for normoxia (M = 4.4, SD = 7.2). The reasoning quality index for conflict invalid syllogisms for mild hypoxia (M = 0.22, SD = 0.29) was marginally significantly less than for normoxia (M = 0.39, SD = 0.35). The chances of these findings occurring by chance cannot be discounted, but are small. Although this study suggests that mild hypoxia might impair working memory and complex logical reasoning involving difficult conflicts, further studies using more discerning tests of cognition are warranted. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Comparison of hypobaric hypoxia symptoms between a recalled exposure and a current exposure</title> <abstract>Background Aircrew members are required to attend hypoxia awareness training regularly to strengthen their memory of their personal hypoxia symptoms by undergoing training inside a hypobaric chamber. The aim of this study was to examine the association between hypoxia symptoms experienced during two training sessions that were 4 years apart. Methods This was a crossover study to compare hypoxia symptoms and self-reported physiological effects of trapped gas between a previous training session and a current training session in an altitude chamber. The subjects were military crew members who undertook a 25,000-feet refresher training course in 2018. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain the target information before and during hypoxia exposure. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results A total of 341 trainees participated in this survey and completely filled out the questionnaire. Gastrointestinal tract discomfort caused by the expansion of trapped gas was the main physiological reaction during the previous and current training sessions. Frequently reported symptoms were poor concentration (30.5%), impaired cognitive function (20.5%), visual disturbances (16.4%), hot flashes (15.8%), and paresthesia (12.6%) during both exposures. However, the proportions of participants reporting poor concentration (P = 0.378) and visual disturbances (P = 0.594) were not significantly different between the recalled and current training sessions. The five most common symptoms among the subjects with less than 1,000 flight hours were poor concentration (29.8%), visual disturbance (27.3%), impaired cognitive function (14.9%), dizziness/lightheadedness (11.6%), and hot flashes (9.9%), which overlapped substantially with the symptoms reported by other subjects. The occurrence of those five most common symptoms in the group with more than 1,000 flight hours did not significantly differ between the recalled training session and the current training session. Conclusions The most common hypoxia symptoms reported were similar between the recalled and current training sessions in an environment with a low oxygen concentration. This finding was also clearly affected by the duration of flight experience. Moreover, GI effects of the expansion of trapped gas were commonly observed at low atmospheric pressure. © 2020 Tu et al.

In the stratosphere, when the aircraft cockpit is depressurized, the pilot switches to breathing pressurized oxygen. However, breathing under such conditions leads to the development of adverse processes that affect the functional state of the body and reduce the quality of aircraft piloting. Programs of psychophysiological training of pilots for such conditions include breathing and speech training under oxygen overpressure. Objective. Effectiveness assessment of a five-day breathing and speech training course under oxygen overpressure in Vietnamese test subjects. Materials and methods. The study involved 35 Vietnamese test subjects aged 19-32. The assessment of the development of breathing skills under oxygen overpressure (OOP) was based on the dynamics of psychological parameters and the pronunciation accuracy of control words. The study used a KM-35 demand oxygen mask in combination with a ZSh-7A pilot protective helmet and a VKK-15 altitude compensating suit to create counterpressure on the chest. OOP was created using the BARS-GD hardware and software complex. The developed course of breathing and speech training under OOP consists of five OOP breathing sessions, which are conducted once a day during five consecutive days. Each session involves breathing under OOP in a sequential and continuous manner at five stages with a breathing time of 2 min at each stage. OOP was created at levels ranging 150-1000 mmHg. The functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) was assessed based on the average time of simple and complex visual-motor reactions (SVMR, CVMR) and the response to a moving object (RMO). The level of situational anxiety, well-being, activity, and mood was assessed using the wellbeing, activity, mood (WAM) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 26 software. Results. As a result of the five-day training course, a statistically significant decrease in the pre-stress level of situational anxiety by 3.9% was observed. Prior to the training course, in the setting of simulated rapid cockpit decompression, a decrease in well-being and mood indicators by 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively, was noted. In addition, the experiment recorded an increase in psychophysiological reserves, which was confirmed by statistically significant changes in the time of simple and complex visual-motor reactions, as well as the results of testing the response to a moving object before and after the training course. Conclusions. The data obtained confirmed the effectiveness of the developed five-day training course, as a result of which the test subjects increased their psychological and psychophysiological readiness to perform tasks under conditions of a sharp decrease in pressure in the pressurized cabin of an aircraft and the operation of high-altitude equipment. The developed five-day training regime of Vietnamese military personnel is recommended for integration into the training system of pilots for high-altitude and stratospheric flights. © A.А.

In most cases, human factors are not working alone, instead they are coupled with complex environment, mechanical factors, physiological and psychological factors of pilots, and organizational management, all of which form a complex aviation safety system. It is vital to investigate the coupling impact of human errors to avoid the occurrence of aviation accidents. In view that the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) provides a hierarchical classification principle of human errors in aviation accidents, and the System Dynamics (SD) approach is helpful to describe the risk evolution process, this paper establishes a hybrid HFACS-SD model by employing the HFACS and the SD approach to reveal the aviation human factors risk evolution mechanism, in which the HFACS is first used to capture the causal factors of human errors risk, and a coupling SD model is then built to describe the evolution of aviation human factors risk supported by historical data. The eigenvalue elasticity analysis is taken to identify critical loops and parameters that have a substantial impact on the system structural behavior, and the influence of parameters and loops is assessed. Simulation results show that the evolution trend of the accident rate can be replicated by the proposed HFACS-SD model, and the structural dominance analysis can efficiently identify critical loops and parameters. Simulation results further show that, with the recommended safety enhancement measures, the stability of the aviation system is increased, and thus lowering the overall accident rate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', ""<title>An integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach to analyze human factors in aviation accidents</title> <abstract>Human factors are critical causes of modern aviation accidents. However, existing accident analysis methods encounter limitations in addressing aviation human factors, especially in complex accident scenarios. The existing graphic approaches are effective for describing accident mechanisms within various categories of human factors, but cannot simultaneously describe inadequate human-aircraft-environment interactions and organizational deficiencies effectively, and highly depend on analysts' skills and experiences. Moreover, the existing methods do not emphasize latent unsafe factors outside accidents. This paper focuses on the above three limitations and proposes an integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach. A new graphic model named accident tree (AcciTree), with a two-mode structure and a reaction-based concept, is developed for accident modeling and safety defense identification. The AcciTree model is then integrated with the well-established human factors analysis and classification system (HFACS) to enhance both reliability of the graphic part and logicality of the taxonomic part for improving completeness of analysis. An associative hazard analysis technique is further put forward to extend analysis to factors outside accidents, to form extended safety requirements for proactive accident prevention. Two crash examples, a research flight demonstrator by our team and an industrial unmanned aircraft, illustrate that the integrated approach is effective for identifying more unsafe factors and safety requirements. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.</abstract>"", '<title>Development taxonomy of human risk factors for corporate sustainability in aviation sector</title> <abstract>Purpose: Contemporary management and strategy mean optimization of ingredient factors such as human factors, systems, operations and equipment. With system approach in management and strategy, human risk factor as input has considerable potential to change results as airworthiness in aviation management. The managers of aviation business also optimize their functions to act safe while making contribution to development in triple of sustainability as economic development and its sustainability; social development and its sustainability; and environmental development and its sustainability. Corporate sustainability can be accomplished via supporting workforce which is the human risk factor. To support (empowerment) workforce, researchers should identify human risk or error factors which are important to this research. The purpose of this study is to suggest holistic framework for working environment system of aircraft maintenance technicians (AMTs) within two respects such as human performance (ergonomics) and corporate performance (sustainability). The secondary purpose of this system is to develop human risk taxonomy by determining the factors affecting both human and work by taking ergonomic aspects in aviation. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a taxonomy of human risk factors for AMTs is developed. These human factors divided into groups and subfactors are obtained from an extensive literature review and experts’ opinions in the field of human performance in aviation. Taxonomy developed will be useful to both sharing and using corporate sources in sustainable way. Findings: Human risk factors can be considered or accepted as factors that cause human error. This may result in the optimum way to managing human risk factor via minimizing human-based error. Personality, hazardous attitudes, individual characteristics, physical/psychological condition of AMTs and corporate social responsibility factors are human-related risk variables in this study. The risks and error can be reduced by recognizing these factors and revealing their relation to ergonomic design. Originality/value: The results of this study are intended to constitute a guide for managers to manage risk factors and to take corrective and preventive actions for their maintenance operations. It is believed that this study is highly important for the aviation sector in terms of raising awareness or providing awareness for similar practices. As taxonomy of the risk factors contributes to the managing human error, corrective actions related to these factors must be taken by managers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>Exploring the intellectual insights in aviation safety research: A systematic literature and bibliometric review</title> <abstract>Research in aviation safety has led to significant advancements in the aviation industry.

Managing aviation requires high awareness on human factor risk which includes organizational behavior-related topics. The greatest risk to an enterprise’s ability to achieve its strategic goals and objectives is the human factor. Both organizational behavior and corporate culture behavior with social psychology are the most vital aspects of management and strategy in terms of human resources. Related risks, including organizational behavior and culture, have the potential to directly impact on both business performance and corporate sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, the most prominent risks were determined in accordance with social psychology, and after identification of human factor-based risks, these have prioritized and prepared risk mapping with fresh approach. For this reason, this study aims to develop risk mapping model for human factors that takes into account interrelations among risk factors three dimensional based new approach. This approach includes both identification of human factor based risks, prioritization them and setting risk mapping according to corporate based qualifications via tailoring risk list. Developed risk map in this paper will help to manage corporate risks to achieve improved performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This new organizational behavior- and culture-focused risk mapping model developed in this study has the potential to make significant contribution to the management of the human factor for modern management and strategy. In enterprise risk management system, risk mapping is both strong and effective strategic methodology to manage ergonomics issue with strategic approach. Human factor is both determinative and also strategic element to both continuity and performance of business operations with safely and sound. In view of management and strategy, vitally, the human factor determines the outcome in both every business and every decision-making. Findings: It is assumed that, if managers manage human risk you may get advantages to achieving corporate strategies in timely manner. Aviation is sensitive sector for its ingredients: airports, airlines, air traffic management, aircraft maintenance, pilotage and ground handling. Aim of this paper is to present risk management approach to optimize human performance while minimizing both failures and errors by aircraft maintenance technician (AMT). This model may apply all human factors in other departments of aviation such as pilots and traffic controllers. AMT is key component of aircraft maintenance. Thus, errors made by AMTs will cause aircraft accidents or incidents or near miss incidents. In this study, new taxonomy model for human risk factors in aircraft maintenance organizations has been designed, and also new qualitative risk assessment as three dimensions is carried out by considering the factors affecting the AMT’s error obtained from extensive literature review and expert opinions in the field of aviation. Human error risks are first categorized into two main groups and sub three groups and then prioritized using the risk matrix via triple dimension as probability, severity and interrelations ratio between risks. Practical implications: Risk mapping is established to decide which risk management option they will apply for managers when they will look at this map. Managers may use risk map to both identify their managerial priorities and share sources to managing risks, and make decisions on risk handling options. This new model may be a useful new tool to manage ergonomic human factor-based risks in developing strategy in aviation business management. In addition, this paper will contribute to department of management and strategy and related literature. Originality/value: This study has originality via new modeling of risk matrix. In this study, dimension of risk analysis has been improved as three dimensions. This study has new approach and new assessment of risk with likelihood (probability), impact (severity) and interrelations ratio. This new model may be a useful new tool to both assess and prioritize mapping of ergonomic-based risks in business management. In addition, this research will contribute to aviation management and strategy literature and also enterprise risk management literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>']"

Under these conditions, psychological and interpersonal stressors will take on added importance in affecting the safety of the crew and the outcome of the mission. Through an analysis of reports from manned American and Soviet space missions and Earth-bound simulations, several psychological, psychiatric, and interpersonal issues can be identified that could affect the success of the space station and other long-duration space ventures. Psychological issues include sleep problems, alteration in time sense, demographic effects, career motivation, transcendent experiences, homesickness, and alteration in perceptual sensitivities. Psychiatric issues include anxiety, depression, and psychosis, psychosomatic symptoms, emotional problems related to the stage of the mission, and postflight personality changes. Interpersonal issues include interpersonal tension, decreased cohesiveness over time, need for privacy, and task vs emotional leadership.

Although many authors have noted that meaningful work may be beneficial for astronauts on these missions, none have detailed the sources of meaningful work for astronauts and how these sources may differ between astronauts. The present article identifies how engagement in meaningful work during long duration missions may mitigate the adverse effects of demands and increase the potential for benefits resulting from the missions. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine NASA personnel, including astronauts, flight directors, and flight surgeons. Questions addressed sources of meaning for astronauts, characteristics of tasks that enhance vs. detract from meaning, and recommendations for enhancing meaning. RESULTS: Personnel mentioned contributing to humanity and the next generation, contributing to the mission, and exploration as the most meaningful aspects of their work. Characteristics of tasks that enhanced meaning included using a variety of skills, feeling personal control over their schedule, autonomy in the execution of tasks, and understanding the importance of the experiments conducted on the mission. Top recommendations to sustain meaning were insuring social needs were met through such activities as the strategic use of social media, giving astronauts autonomy as well as structure, and conducting training during transit. DISCUSSION: Implications are addressed for tailoring meaning-based interventions for astronauts participating on long duration missions and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>A Comprehensive Look Behind Team Composition for Long Duration Spaceflight</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: How to determine team composition is one of many key topics when developing humanity’s next deep space exploration programs. Behavioral health and performance among spaceflight teams are key aspects impacted by team composition and cohesiveness. METHODS: T his narrative review highlights areas of consideration for building cohesive teams in long duration spaceflight environments. The authors gathered information from a variety of team-behavior related studies that focused on team composition, cohesion, and dynamics, as well as others topics such as faultlines and subgroups, diversity, personality traits, personal values, and crew compatibility training. RESULTS: T he literature suggests that team cohesion occurs more easily when individuals are similar to one another, and deeplevel variables such as personality and personal values have a greater impact on crew compatibility than surface level variables such as age, nationality, or gender. Diversity can have both positive and negative impacts on team cohesiveness. CONCLUSION: T eam composition, as well as pre-mission conflict resolution training can greatly impact group cohesion.

Consequently, it is important to consider interpersonal and group dynamic issues to assure that mission goals are accomplished. Simulation studies on Earth and anecdotal reports from space have described a number of such issues that include crew heterogeneity, culture and language variations, leadership roles, and personality differences. Problems that can result include increased group tension, decreased cohesion, subgrouping, scapegoating, miscommunication, role confusion, and displacement of tension and dysphoria from one group to another. The three papers by Drs. Caldwell, Kanas, and Stuster that are presented in this session address some of these issues at the group level. They suggest three critical questions related to: 1) improving communication between space crews and Mission Control personnel; 2) dealing with emotional and interpersonal decrements during the second half of space missions; and 3) minimizing the effects of culture and language differences. These questions in turn lead to six research strategies related to: 1) developing and testing new technologies to enhance crew-ground communication; 2) developing tools to recognize important communication themes and the factors that affect them over time; 3) studying the ability of voice analysis technology to detect on-board interpersonal stress; 4) developing and testing countermeasures to deal with second half emotional and interpersonal decrements; 5) studying the effects of cultural and language differences on crew tension, cohesion, and performance; and 6) studying the effects of crew heterogeneity and size on crew tension, cohesion, and performance.</abstract>', ""<title>United States experience on the utilization of man's capabilities in a space environment.</title> <abstract>This paper concerns the stresses on the flight crew in various phases of space flight missions and the ability of the crew to perform piloting-type tasks as well as other specific operations in the presence of these stresses. The mission phases include powered flight, free flight, space maneuvers, atmospheric entry, terminal phase, and surface operation. The stresses of the space environment are caused by forces and or motions or lack thereof, the space environment itself, the nature of the environment within the spacecraft, and the mental and physical demands on the flight crew. Among crew functions are control of the onboard systems, navigation and guidance of the spacecraft, maintenance and emergency operation, communications, and the conduct of scientific experiments. The paper draws on information obtained from the flight research to date as well as from ground tests and analyses. From the results one can conclude that man can very ably withstand the stresses of short duration missions into near space and has demonstrated ability to perform the type of tasks associated with flight crew operation. The chief unknown factors of future flight operations are the stresses produced by longer duration missions. Consideration of the problems involved leads to the conclusion that they are amenable to engineering solution at some expense to spacecraft weight and performance. It appears desirable therefore to utilize the flight crew to a high degree in future missions in the type of tasks where human judgment is needed or where significant simplification of on-board equipment may result.</abstract>""]"

Focusing on risk mitigation, NASA conducted investigations that addressed spaceflight health hazards to varying degrees. This pilot mission was initiated to gain further knowledge and monitor the physiological, psychological, and medical effects of long-duration exposure to spaceflight. METHODS: NASA's Human Research Program and the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Biomedical Problems identified more than 20 biomedical risk-reduction research investigations to be conducted on the two crewmembers before, during, and after their yearlong expedition. A database of results, as well as observations on programmatic resources, was collected to understand essential elements for future spaceflight health studies. RESULTS: Statistical rigor requires additional testing at a length of 1 yr to demonstrate the presence or absence of unacceptable deleterious effects, and to permit extrapolation to longer durations in space. Review of experimental procedures from this mission suggests potential efficiencies for future investigations. DISCUSSION: The Kelly-Kornienko 1-yr mission demonstrated the importance of continuing joint investigations with the adoption of standard measures for rigorous comparisons across disparate populations. It identified improvements to collaborative processes across national and international scientific research programs. Additional studies will inform the development of an integrated applied research methodology for the space station and future interplanetary expeditions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", ""<title>Radiation environment at aviation altitudes and in space</title> <abstract>On the Earth, protection from cosmic radiation is provided by the magnetosphere and the atmosphere, but the radiation exposure increases with increasing altitude. Aircrew and especially space crew members are therefore exposed to an increased level of ionising radiation. Dosimetry onboard aircraft and spacecraft is however complicated by the presence of neutrons and high linear energy transfer particles. Film and thermoluminescent dosimeters, routinely used for ground-based personnel, do not reliably cover the range of particle types and energies found in cosmic radiation. Further, the radiation field onboard aircraft and spacecraft is not constant; its intensity and composition change mainly with altitude, geomagnetic position and solar activity (marginally also with the aircraft/spacecraft type, number of people aboard, amount of fuel etc.). The European Union Council directive 96/29/Euroatom of 1996 specifies that aircrews that could receive dose of > 1 mSv y-1 must be evaluated. The dose evaluation is routinely performed by computer programs, e.g. CARI-6, EPCARD, SIEVERT, PCAire, JISCARD and AVIDOS. Such calculations should however be carefully verified and validated. Measurements of the radiation field in aircraft are thus of a great importance. A promising option is the long-term deployment of active detectors, e.g. silicon spectrometer Liulin, TEPC Hawk and pixel detector Timepix. Outside the Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetosphere, the environment is much harsher than at aviation altitudes. In addition to the exposure to high energetic ionising cosmic radiation, there are microgravity, lack of atmosphere, psychological and psychosocial components etc. The milieu is therefore very unfriendly for any living organism. In case of solar flares, exposures of spacecraft crews may even be lethal. In this paper, long-term measurements of the radiation environment onboard Czech aircraft performed with the Liulin since 2001, as well as measurements and simulations of dose rates on and outside the International Space Station were presented. The measured and simulated results are discussed in the context of health impact. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

Heart rates tend to stabilize at lower levels in zero gravity and electrical activity, except for occasional bigeminis and premature auricular and ventricular contractions (Apollo 15), is normal. Postflight, cardiac silhouette size is decreased. Reduced orthostatic tolerance is consistently found. Slight loss of bone mass has been observed as has decreased leg size and, in the 2 week Gemini flight, slightly negative nitrogen balance. Electrolyte changes parallel the time course of body weight loss and gain. Hormone changes are consistent with electrolyte changes. Growth of 'opportunistic' organisms is favored, with a resistance to antibiotics demonstrated by some. The number and distribution of microorganisms also change. Vestibular problems are minimal: adaptation appears to occur rapidly. Countermeasures to zero g effects are being explored. The use of lower body negative pressure is under investigation as a means of delaying, reducing, or preventing redistribution of the circulating blood volume in zero g. The use of medications is under investigation for, for example, cardiovascular and anti radiation protection. Vestibular preadaptation programs are being considered, particularly for non test pilot space travelers. In future, longer duration space flights, psychological variables may become increasingly significant. The effects of isolation, estrangement, and reduced privacy on crew stability are being studied. Crew composition is being reassessed with a view toward including female crew members. Improved sleeping accommodations, entertainment facilities, and food will be provided. Waste management and personal hygiene facilities, while still 'basic' by earth based standards, are being steadily improved. In the opinion of the author, 6 months of biomedical, psychological, and human factors data of the type that the Skylab program will begin to collect will be sufficient basis for predicting man's safe commitment to a Mars mission with appropriate understanding of the range of adaptational changes and use of countermeasures where they are found necessary.</abstract>"", '<title>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during spaceflight - a guideline for CPR in microgravity from the German Society of Aerospace Medicine (DGLRM) and the European Society of Aerospace Medicine Space Medicine Group (ESAM-SMG)</title> <abstract>Background: With the “Artemis”-mission mankind will return to the Moon by 2024. Prolonged periods in space will not only present physical and psychological challenges to the astronauts, but also pose risks concerning the medical treatment capabilities of the crew. So far, no guideline exists for the treatment of severe medical emergencies in microgravity. We, as a international group of researchers related to the field of aerospace medicine and critical care, took on the challenge and developed a an evidence-based guideline for the arguably most severe medical emergency – cardiac arrest. Methods: After the creation of said international group, PICO questions regarding the topic cardiopulmonary resuscitation in microgravity were developed to guide the systematic literature research. Afterwards a precise search strategy was compiled which was then applied to “MEDLINE”. Four thousand one hundred sixty-five findings were retrieved and consecutively screened by at least 2 reviewers. This led to 88 original publications that were acquired in full-text version and then critically appraised using the GRADE methodology. Those studies formed to basis for the guideline recommendations that were designed by at least 2 experts on the given field. Afterwards those recommendations were subject to a consensus finding process according to the DELPHI-methodology. Results: We recommend a differentiated approach to CPR in microgravity with a division into basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) similar to the Earth-based guidelines. In immediate BLS, the chest compression method of choice is the Evetts-Russomano method (ER), whereas in an ALS scenario, with the patient being restrained on the Crew Medical Restraint System, the handstand method (HS) should be applied. Airway management should only be performed if at least two rescuers are present and the patient has been restrained. A supraglottic airway device should be used for airway management where crew members untrained in tracheal intubation (TI) are involved. Discussion: CPR in microgravity is feasible and should be applied according to the Earth-based guidelines of the AHA/ERC in relation to fundamental statements, like urgent recognition and action, focus on high-quality chest compressions, compression depth and compression-ventilation ratio. However, the special circumstances presented by microgravity and spaceflight must be considered concerning central points such as rescuer position and methods for the performance of chest compressions, airway management and defibrillation. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract>']"

A first step in predicting how future changes will impact flight crews and ATC is to examine the current system and to pinpoint problematic areas that could be ameliorated or exacerbated by advanced automation and heavier traffic density. In this study, we coded Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports identified as having communication conflicts between pilots and ATC. Results describe types of conflict, operational context, phase of flight, operator states, and situations conducive to communication conflicts, risk perception differences, and inappropriate resolution strategies. Reports suggest that high workload approach and landing phases are conducive to communication conflicts, that different interpretations of the same information might lead to conflict, and that operator state could impact communication and collaboration between flight crews and ATC. A specific problem was noted when reporters felt that the affective response of the other party was not appropriate to the situation. Although this study reflects the limitations inherent in ASRS data, it can provide insights into potential problem areas and conflict triggers in NextGen operations.

Background: Three horizontal distances determine risk judgments about conflict between two aircraft: (a) Dt<inf>0</inf> is the distance between the crossing of the aircraft trajectories and the first aircraft to reach that point; (b) Dt<inf>h</inf> is the distance between the two aircraft when they are horizontally closest; and (c) Dt<inf>v</inf> is the horizontal distance between the two aircraft when their growing vertical distance reaches 1,000 feet. Methods: Two experiments tested whether the variables in the model reflect what controllers do. In Experiment 1, 125 certified controllers provided risk judgments about situations in which the model variables were manipulated. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between the model and expertise by comparing a population of certified controllers with a population of ATC students. Results: Across both experiments, the model accounted for 44% to 50% of the variance in risk judgments by certified controllers (N = 161) but only 20% in judgments by ATC students (N = 88). There were major individual differences in the predictive power of the model as well as in the contributions of the three variables. In Experiment 2, the model described experts better than novices. Conclusion: The model provided a satisfying account of the data, albeit with substantial individual differences. It is argued that an individual-differences approach is required when investigating the strategies involved in conflict judgment in ATC. Application: These findings should have implications for developing user-friendly interfaces with conflict detection devices and for devising ATC training programs.

Background: In previous research, situation awareness was not measured with valid and reliable instruments. Previous work also evaluated separation assurance and spacing concepts individually, and did not examine weather. Method: Retired ATCos worked en route and transitional sectors. Four operating concepts for separation assurance and spacing were tested based on whether automation or ATCo was responsible for each function. Standard methods for assessing workload and situation awareness were used; performance measures included safety and efficiency. Results: Workload was lowest when both functions were automated; however, situation awareness depended on operating concept and sector. In the en route sector, the highest levels of situation awareness were found for ATCo-managed separation assurance and automation-managed spacing. In the transitional sector, the highest situation awareness occurred when ATCos performed both functions. The numbers of loss of separation were highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance; sector complexity depended on weather, but only for automation-managed separation assurance. Spacing efficiency was highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance, but more communications were required. Conclusion: In air traffic management, separation assurance and spacing functions interact with each other in determining ATCo workload, situation awareness, and performance, depending on sector characteristics and weather. Therefore, evaluations of NextGen-automation solutions must include multiple concepts of operation, and involve different sectors and environmental conditions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The Difficulty to Break a Relational Complexity Network Can Predict Air Traffic Controllers’ Mental Workload and Performance in Conflict Resolution</title> <abstract>Objective: To test the network disentangling model for explaining air traffic controllers’ (ATCos) conflict resolution performance. The network rigidity index (NRI), and the steps to break the relational complexity network following a central-available-node-first rule, was hypothesized to explain the overall task demand, whereas marginal-effort-decrease rule was expected to explain the actual operational outcome. Background: Understanding the conflict resolution process of ATCos is important for aviation safety and efficiency. However, linear models are insufficient. We proposed a new model that ATCos behavior can be largely considered as a process to break the relational complexity network, in which nodes represent the aircraft while links represent the cognitive complexity to understand the aircraft dyad relationship. Method: Twenty-one professional ATCos completed 27 conflict resolution scenarios that varied in the NRI and other control variables. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to understand the influence of the NRI on the number of interventions, mental workload, and unresolved rate. A cross-validation was performed to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Results: NRI influenced ATCos intervention number in a curvilinear manner, which further leads to ATCo’s mental workload. The deviance between the number of interventions and the NRI was strongly linked with unresolved rate. Cross-validation suggests that the models predictions are robust. Conclusion: The network disentangling model provides a useful theory-driven way to explain controllers’ conflict resolution workload and other important performance outcomes such as intervention probability. Application: The proposed model can potentially be used for workload management, sector design, and intelligent decision support tool development. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>', '<title>Air traffic controller performance and workload under mature free flight: Conflict detection and resolution of aircraft self-separation</title> <abstract>The effects of conflict detection and self-separating aircraft resolution on the mental workload and performance of en-route air traffic controllers were examined. An air traffic control simulator was used to manipulate traffic loads and traffic complexity. A mature stage of free flight was simulated by having controllers monitor self-separating aircraft. Four 30-min scenarios were created to combine moderate (11 aircraft) and heavy traffic loads (17 aircraft) in a 50-mile radius sector with the presence or absence of self-separating and conflicting aircraft. Conflicts (defined as a loss of separation of 5 nm laterally and 1,000 ft vertically) were indicated to the controller by the appearance of a red circle around each of the aircraft involved. A self-separation event was defined as an evasive maneuver (either altitude or speed change) made by 1 aircraft to avoid a potential conflict with another aircraft. Performance and workload measurements indicated that controllers had difficulty both in detecting conflicts and in recognizing self-separating events in a timely manner in saturated airspace. Controller mental workload also increased, as indexed both by subjective and secondary task measures.

Four seminal issues that threaten the interpretation of the results of ability studies are introduced and examined. A brief history of the use of g in pilot selection is presented, going back to the World War I era. At that time, many countries used tests such as perception and reaction time, later shown to be mostly measures of g. The World War II era brought the age of the multiple aptitude batteries, and with it, the theory of differential abilities. However, most militaries still used highly g-saturated measures. More recently, an awareness of the prominence of g in job performance has led to a series of studies that showed the central role of g in predicting pilot success. In comparative analyses, g was found to be a better predictor of pilot criteria than specific abilities. However, some specific abilities or measures of job knowledge were found to increment the predictiveness of g. Several selection variables that appeared to measure characteristics other than g were found to measure, at least in some part, g. These include psychomotor tests and structured interviews. Finally, speculation on the future of the measurement of g is presented.</abstract>', '<title>Investigating the Predictive Validity of the COMPASS Pilot Selection Test</title> <abstract>Objective: The present study examined the predictive validity of a widely used pilot selection test known as COMPASS, in terms of its ability to distinguish between candidates and predict individuals’ aptitude for flying. Background: The Computerized Pilot Aptitude Screening System, more commonly known as COMPASS is a widely used selection test for ab-initio pilots. However, a literature search failed to uncover any research examining its predictive validity. Method: Thirty-five trainee pilots completed COMPASS, along with a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator to obtain an objective flight performance measure. Hours to flying milestones, including first solo and Recreational Pilot License, along with more subjective measures such as performance ratings by flying instructors were also compared to COMPASS. Twenty non-pilots also completed COMPASS. Results: The results revealed COMPASS to be effective in distinguishing between trainee pilots and non-pilots. However, there was no relationship between COMPASS scores and the various flight performance measures. Conclusion: These results should aid decision-makers when considering the viability of pilot selection tests, and reiterate the importance of using multiple methods/tools when attempting to select appropriate candidates for a specific role. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Understanding the Relations Between Selection Factors and Pilot Training Performance: Does the Criterion Make a Difference?</title> <abstract>Although several valid predictors of U.S. Air Force pilot training performance have been identified, it was felt that our understanding of the relation between preselection personnel attribute data and training performance was limited by the dichotomous nature of the outcome indicators (i.e., graduation or elimination) and by the disproportionate number of people in the outcome categories. A weighted composite of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) flying performance data (i.e., daily flying grades, check flight grades, and academic grades) was shown to be related closely to advanced training recommendations (fighter vs. nonfighter aircraft). This suggested that this composite score was a reasonable measure of pilot candidate quality because fighter aircraft assignments are considered more prestigious and demanding than nonfighter assignments. When the weighted composite algorithm was modified to include UPT eliminees, however, it demonstrated little utility in adding to our understanding of the relation between performance on selection instruments (i.e., test scores) and training performance (i.e., had little impact on the rankings of the applicants). These results were not surprising, however, as the dichotomous UPT final outcome indicator was strongly correlated with UPT performance as measured by the weighted composite scores. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For the derivation study, 225 pilot candidates operated CAPSS before entering PFS. A pool of 20,700 summary measures (SMs) from 880 data sets was generated from the raw data. Through several cycles of analyses these measures were reduced to a single prediction equation. The equation was cross-validated on a new sample of 172 pilot candidates. The CAPSS equation significantly predicted PFS outcome for the cross-validation sample, r =. 47, p <. 00005. Classification analysis indicated that 79.4% of the candidates selected by CAPSS actually passed PFS, compared to 69.8% for the current selection system. Only 13.3% of those who could have passed were rejected, whereas the current system is estimated to reject 57.0% of qualified applicants. It is estimated that using CAPSS instead of the current selection system will double the number of PFS graduates from a group of applicants. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Background: Whereas verbal and math tests are commonly used in academic and pre-employment selection, spatial ability and perceptual speed testing are less common. Spatial ability and perceptual speed tests have been a mainstay in U.S. Air Force aviation training selection batteries for decades, as part of the process for selecting aviation training candidates. Method and Results: Factor analysis (Study 1) of spatial, perceptual speed, and academic aptitude tests shows a 2-factor solution. Meta-analysis results (Study 2) of the predictive validity of spatial and perceptual speed tests relative to verbal, math, and technical knowledge tests show spatial ability, aviation knowledge, and perceptual speed tests are better significant predictors of aviator flying performance, whereas academic aptitude best predicts classroom performance. Incremental validity analyses (Study 3) of spatial and perceptual speed above academic and technical knowledge for academic and pilot trainee flying performance were performed. Although spatial ability lacks incremental validity over academic and technical aptitude, perceptual speed has incremental validity above academic and technical aptitude for predicting pilot trainee flying performance. Conclusion: Perceptual speed, an aspect of spatial ability, can provide incremental predictive validity beyond academic and technical knowledge measures alone for applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields like military aviation. ©, This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.</abstract>']"

The results show that DSV operators (DSV Oprs) had a significantly less asocial developmental pattern than divers, while developmental experiences of DSV crews (DSV Crs) were similar to those of divers. Personality measures (EPPS) indicate that both DSV Oprs and DSV Crs are presently more sociable as adults than divers and would probably be more effective in situations involving small group interaction. The modifications which have occurred in the behavior of DSV Crs may be related to experience in the highly interpersonal DSV situation. The findings also show that DSV Oprs prefer to take fewer risks than divers, while the DSV Crs are more like divers in risk taking behavior. The implications of this research to DSV mission effectiveness are discussed. These findings indicate that divers would probably not be effective DSV Oprs, and that measures of sociability and interpersonal responsiveness may be especially useful in recruiting and managing personnel in DSV operations. The social characteristics and interpersonal behavior patterns described by these results may be among the most important factors in DSV mission effectiveness. Replication of these results on other DSV personnel, such as civilian DSV Oprs, would strengthen these conclusions.</abstract>', '<title>Marital adjustment and personality in aviation-rated and nonrated warrant officers.</title> <abstract>[No abstract available]</abstract>']"

Background: Numerous studies suggest that estimating the closest point of approach (CPA) to heavy weather is difficult, and that current in-cockpit NEXRAD may be intrinsically inadequate for the task. Method: To investigate theoretically, we first examined the visual information present in looping NEXRAD. This predicted inherent task difficulty. Next, to investigate empirically, we developed a mathematical model of an “ideal storm,” generated a looping NEXRAD-type part-task simulation, and tested 21 general aviation (GA) pilots to measure effects of weather system depth (19 vs. 40 nm), and the opening and closing of gaps at various closure rates between cells (14, 7, 0, 7, 14 kt). Results: For the values tested, weather system depth had no significant effect on clearance from heavy weather (>40 dBZ reflectivity). However, weather movement greatly degraded safety. Moreover, it did not seem to matter if movement was as slow as 7 kt, nor whether gaps were opening or closing. Any weather movement made an already difficult task more so. Conclusion: Analysis suggests the necessity of adding future-predicted weather plus a range ring. Without these two key elements, judgment of CPA will clearly remain difficult. Training is also necessary to improve performance, but is unlikely to be sufficient. © , This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.</abstract>', '<title>A Two-Stage Model of Diversion Knowledge and Skills Highlights Where Pilot Factors Impact Safety-Related Outcomes</title> <abstract>Objective: To assist stakeholders apply targeted safety strategies, we developed and tested a two-stage model of diversion knowledge and skills. Background: Understanding pilot factors in weather-related diversions is integral to reducing the phenomenon of visual flight rules flight into meteorological conditions. Method: Thirty-six general aviation pilots flew a cross-country flight in a Cessna 172 simulator where they encountered an ATC-directed diversion due to deteriorating weather. Path analyses quantified effects in a two-stage model based on criteria specified by aviation regulations. Results: In stage 1, low cognitive flexibility and fewer recent pilot-in-command hours were associated with greater likelihood of ignoring the diversion instruction. Low cognitive flexibility was also associated with errors in locating the alternate aerodrome and incorrect procedures at the alternate. At stage 2, there were significant positive paths from a diversion efficiency variable to all aspects of pilotage. Pilotage positively predicted awareness of ownship and traffic, and was associated with fewer altitude violations. Conclusion: We provide empirical evidence for the association between the cognitive factors related to continuation bias and high-risk responses to diversion instructions. Using a two-stage model to conceptualize pilot performance illuminates the impact of cognitive factors in weather-related diversions. Highlighting the pivotal human factors at two clear junctions of an unexpected diversion can more fully prepare pilots to safely manage these risk-laden events. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Pilot behaviors in the face of adverse weather: A new look at an old problem</title> <abstract>Introduction: Weather-related general aviation accidents remain one of the most significant causes for concern in aviation safety. Previous studies have typically compared accident and non-accident cases. In contrast, the current study does not concentrate on occurrence outcome. Instead, the emphasis is on the different behaviors that pilots exhibit in the face of adverse weather and, by inference, on the decision-making processes that underlie those behaviors. Methods: This study compares three weather-related behaviors that reflect different levels of risk: visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions ('VFR into IMC'); precautionary landing; and other significant weather avoidance actions. Occurrence data (n = 491) were drawn from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau database of aviation occurrences, and included weather-related accidents, incidents, and 'normal operations.' Results: There were few significant differences between the three weather-related behavior groups in terms of pilot demographics, aircraft characteristics, geographic or environmental factors, or absolute flight distances. The pattern of relative flight distances (a psychological construct) was markedly different for the three groups, with pilots in the weather avoidance group being distinguished by taking timely action. Discussion: The relative distance results suggest that the mid-point of the flight can be a 'psychological turning point' for pilots, irrespective of the absolute flight distance involved. Hence, pilots' behavior was sometimes influenced by psychological factors not related to any particular operational aspect of the flight. The results of the weather avoidance group indicate that a safe pilot is a proactive pilot. Dealing with adverse weather is not a one-off decision but a continually evolving process. This aspect is discussed in terms of the concept of 'mindfulness'.

Pilots are required to make weather-related preflight risk assessments to accept or reject a flight. This study's aim was to develop predictive risk assessment tools based on historical accident data to assist the decision-making process. METHODS: We analyzed 32 single-pilot HEMS night-time visual flight rules fatal accidents to identify contributory risk factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop prediction nomograms for nonvisual meteorological conditions (non-VMC), cause and nonsurvivable accidents as dependent variables. Risk factors such as temperature dew point spread, elevation difference, and years of HEMS pilot experience, were entered as continuous variables. Flight crew composition, pilot DTE (domain task experience) and flight rule capability, primary missions, and temperature dew point spread were entered as categorical variables. A point scoring matrix transposed model probability to likelihood and consequence severity. RESULTS: The nomograms correctly predicted the likelihood of entering non-VMC, accident cause, and sustaining a nonsurvivable accident in 75%, 55%, and 94% of cases, respectively. Using data from a recent nonsurvivable HEMS accident, the nomogram estimated a 92% probability (Very Likely) of nonsurvivable accident if visual cues were lost. CONCLUSION: These nomograms can provide preflight information to predict the likelihood of adverse safety outcomes occurring during a planned HEMS mission. While further development work is needed, this approach has the potential to improve HEMS operational safety. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"", '<title>General Aviation Weather Alerting: The Effectiveness of Different Visual and Tactile Display Characteristics in Supporting Weather-Related Decision Making</title> <abstract>Objective: This research analyzed the effects of weather technology interface characteristics on the quality and timeliness of weather-related decision making via mental workload and situational awareness (SA) metrics using flight training devices (FTDs) and follow-up in-flight validation testing. Background: A significant number of fatal general aviation (GA) accidents are attributable to pilots flying into instrument meteorological conditions without the necessary certification for safe operation. Even when takeoff conditions are clear, they can degrade in flight. Pilots might consult in-flight\xa0 weather technologies to inform flight-plan-related decisions. Method: GA pilots flew 2 scenarios in FTDs while receiving weather notifications (referred to here as alerts) via complex graphical or smart-watch-based visual displays and under different vibrotactile cuing conditions. In-flight testing examined if vibrotactile cuing effects found in simulation were present in real flight. Results: Results suggest the quality and timeliness of weather-related flight decisions and flight-related SA are better supported when displays use vibrotactile cues and embed alert text within maps rather than present it separately on a smart watch. In-flight data confirmed that pilots can reliably perceive vibrotactile cues in real aircraft. Conclusion: Vibrotactile cues improve the reception of notifications and can reduce cognitive demands while flying. Visual weather information should be displayed on larger screens that are positioned to reduce pilots’ postural reorientation. These findings can inform the design of weather technologies for supporting pilot in-flight decision making. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

One major reason for this is that women and minorities have less aviation-related background experience. In response to this need the '150' Predevelopmental program was begun to give those selected for the program a 1-year orientation to aviation and air traffic control prior to FAA Academy training. The purpose of this research was to study the unique relationship between Predevelopmental training and Academy success. Since random selection and/or assignment of subjects to the Predevelopmental program is not feasible and a matching control group was not available, traditional research methods and statistical analyses were not appropriate. Consequently, path analysis was employed where derived significant relationships were considered simultaneously to determine the unique relationship between Predevelopment training and Academy success. The path models indicated that Predevelopmental training overall does significantly enhance a trainee's potential for Academy success with a possible differential effect according to minority status. This study demonstrates that path models can be used to considerable utility in assessing special aviation-related training programs.</abstract>"", '<title>Relationships of anxiety scores to screening and training status of air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>The present study assessed the relationship between anxiety, as measured by the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), and success of post-strike air traffic control specialist (ATCS) trainees at the FAA Academy and during field training. The STPI was administered to students who entered the FAA Academy between June 1984 and September 1985. Academy test scores were obtained for 1,790 students in the en route option. Criterion data included the field training status of the Academy graduates as of July 1988. Statistical analyses determined the relationships between ATCS student scores on the STPI measures and a) normative data and b) Academy screening and field training results. ATCS students reported significantly lower state (current level) and trait (proneness) levels of anxiety than did either college students or military recruits. Trainees who had relatively high scores (for ATCSs) on a combined index of the trait and state measures of anxiety exhibited significantly higher a) percentages of Academy failures/withdrawals, b) percentages of option switchers in the field, and c) overall field attrition, than did trainees with low scores. Results support the operation of some personality-related self-selection among ATCS applicants regarding anxiety and the importance of this low anxiety characteristic for ATCS job success.</abstract>', '<title>Determinants of enlisted air traffic controller success</title> <abstract>Background: This paper provides a brief historical overview of air traffic controller (ATC) selection, reviews current U.S. Air Force (USAF) selection procedures for enlisted ATC trainees, and summarizes the results of three recent studies. Method: Study 1 examined the validity of the operational selection test (i.e., Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or ASVAB) against apprentice-level training performance. Study 2 evaluated the impact of alternative selection procedures on training attrition and eligibility for training. Study 3 reviewed the results of a survey of enlisted ATCs designed to identify the personnel characteristics and organizational factors that influence training and job performance. Discussion: The current selection composite demonstrated acceptable validity for predicting apprentice-level training performance. Alternative cut-score analyses revealed that raising the minimum qualifying score in order to reduce attrition by 5% would lead to an unacceptable 20% reduction in the number of eligible ATC candidates. Using a different ASVAB composite for selection would have less overall impact on the qualification rate, but would disproportionally disqualify women. Results of a survey of enlisted ATCs indicated they were generally satisfied and motivated. In addition, they identified several abilities required for on-the-job performance that are not measured by current USAF selection methods. These included memorization and retention of new information, spatial orientation/visualization, ability to work well in stressful environments, ability to shift between two or more sources of information, and ability to combine and organize information. Implications for ATC selection and training as well as future research directions are discussed.</abstract>', '<title>Physiological and psychological characteristics of successful combat controller trainees.</title> <abstract>The United States Air Force (USAF) Combat Controller (CCT) training pipeline is extremely arduous and historically has an attrition rate of 70-80%. The primary objective of this study was to identify the physiological, psychological, or demographical characteristics associated with successful progression through the CCT pipeline program. A battery of physiological measurements, biographical information, and psychological tests were used to determine the profile of a successful CCT trainee. These measures were chosen on the basis of being standard physical fitness parameters, CCT-specific physical attribute indicators or validated psychological surveys. A multiple of physical tests served as measurements for cardiovascular endurance (VO2max and running economy), ?anaerobic? capacity (Wingate power and loaded anaerobic endurance treadmill tests), body composition skinfolds measurements, power (Wingate and vertical jump), and reaction time (Makoto eye-hand test.) Each test was conducted using a standardized protocol. Psychological characteristics were explored through use of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP-NEO) and the Mental Toughness Questionnaire 48 (MTQ 48). Our findings revealed the following mean characteristics of 109 CCTs who completed Phase I of the pipeline and achieved their 3-level rating: 23 years old, 1.8m tall, 81 kg, 12% body fat, VO2max of 59 ml/kg/min, vertical jump of 62 cm, able to generate 11.4 W/kg peak power and 9.3 W/Kg mean power during Wingate tests, overall mental toughness rating of 8 (out of 10) with high levels of extraversion and conscientiousness and low levels of neuroticism. The most popular competitive sport played in high school was football, followed by track, wrestling, and baseball. The results of the investigation confirm that CCT trainees who have achieved a 3-level rating possess much higher than average levels of aerobic and anaerobic fitness, power, mental toughness, extraversion and conscientiousness. They possess lower than average levels of neuroticism and openness to experience. These results may prove useful in refining the selection criteria and in designing training for CCT trainees. 2011.</abstract>', ""<title>Objective assessment of prior air traffic control-related experience through the use of an occupational knowledge test</title> <abstract>The Occupational Knowledge Test (OKT) 101-B was administered to 784 air traffic control trainees who entered the FAA Academy's 16-week training course in 1976. All trainees completed the nonradar laboratory portion of the training and, in addition, completed a preemployment questionnaire. Based on responses to the questionnaire, the trainees were assigned to one of three experience groups, corresponding to groups given credit for experience using Civil Service Commission (CSC) selection procedures. It was found that the OKT was highly correlated with experience (r=0.64) and, in addition, had a higher correlation with successful completion of the nonradar lab than did experience (r = 0.25 vs. 0.12). It was determined that use of an OKT score of 75 or above to assign extra credit would result in a failure rate of 3.1% for those receiving credit, while use of the current experience scale would result in a failure rate of 7.6% for those receiving extra credit on the CSC selection battery. The results held up for a cross-validation sample of 432 trainees who entered the Academy during 1977. Based on the results, it is recommended that an OKT score of 75 or above be used to assign extra credit for experience in the selection of air traffic controllers.</abstract>""]"

It is part of a new perspective aimed at understanding better the concept of commitment, a powerful determinant of employee retention, by looking at gone commitments. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a qualitative methodology recommended in the most recent commitment literature, life story interviews (Study 1 – flight attendants) and non-directive interviews (Study 2 – pilots) were conducted. Findings: The authors propose a revised process model of quondam commitments, including the possible transformation of a commitment bond into a different type of psychological bond over time. Research limitations/implications: The sample sizes are limited because of the qualitative nature of both studies, and the quondam commitment outcomes could only be studied at the individual level. However, the innovative nature of the work offers important contributions and avenues for research. Practical implications: This study provides concrete perspectives for hospitality professionals to retain employees who question their relationship with work. Its relevance goes beyond the airline sector and can be applied to the hotel or restaurant industry, looking for solutions to deal with massive attrition. Originality/value: This research contributes to filling three gaps identified in the commitment literature. It is one of the very rare studies considering closely both multiple targets and multiple types of psychological bonds.

Although emotional labour can be performed face-to-face (in person) or voice-to-voice (on the telephone), little is known about whether the type of emotional demands and the relationships with strain outcomes differ according to mode of delivery. The purpose of this paper is to research these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Relationships are assessed between three dimensions of emotional labour (emotional display rules, and the faking and suppression of emotions) and strain outcomes (psychological distress, work-life conflict and job satisfaction) in a sample of 124-cabin crew (face-to-face interaction) and 122 telesales agents (voice-to-voice interaction). The emotional labour dimensions that are significant predictors of strain outcomes for both groups are examined by multiple regression. Findings - No significant differences were observed between groups in mean levels of emotional labour variables. A greater proportion of variance in all types of strain was explained by the emotional labour components for participants who interact with customers face-to-face but these differences did not reach statistical significance. The emotional labour dimensions that predicted each strain outcome varied according to mode of delivery. Practical implications - Ways by which service sector organisations might counteract the potentially negative effects of performing emotional labour are discussed. Originality/value - The study provides some initial evidence that the impact of mode of delivery in emotion work is worthy of further investigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>Does trust in organization mediate the influence of servant leadership on satisfaction outcomes among flight attendants?</title> <abstract>Purpose: Drawing from servant leadership (SL) and social exchange theories, our study investigates trust in organization (TIO) as a mediator of the impact of SL on job, career and life satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: A time-lagged survey design was used to gather data from flight attendants in Turkey. Structural equation modeling was used as the main analytic tool to assess these relationships. Findings: The relationships proposed in the authors’ study receive full support from the empirical data. Specifically, TIO is one of the immediate outcomes of SL that engenders job, career and life satisfaction at elevated levels. The results highlight the impacts of job and career satisfaction in the intermediate linkage between SL and life satisfaction. Practical implications: Management should train managerial employees to enhance the understanding of SL, which boosts flight attendants’ TIO. Management should invest in human resources through training and empowerment. This makes flight attendants perceive that management does not violate psychological contract. Such employees develop TIO that in turn engenders higher job, career and life satisfaction. It is also important to reward servant leaders when they succeed in making flight attendants develop TIO and motivating them to have higher job performance. Originality/value: Little is known about the consequences of SL in the extant service research. More importantly, there are still calls for research about the variables (e.g. TIO) mediating the relationship between SL and employee satisfaction outcomes. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>Building Sustainable Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Hospitality: Structural Relationships of Rapport, Trust, and Psychological Capital Among Airline Cabin Crew</title> <abstract>This study examines the structural relationships among rapport, trust, psychological capital (PsyCap), and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) in the emotionally demanding work context of airline cabin crews. Grounded in the job demands–resources (JD-R) model and social exchange theory (SET), we propose and test a sequential mediation model in which rapport is positively associated with trust, trust is positively associated with PsyCap, and PsyCap is positively associated with OCB. Based on survey data from 248 South Korean flight attendants, structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrates that rapport is indirectly associated with OCB through the sequential mediation of trust and PsyCap, rather than displaying a significant direct association. The findings indicate that rapport functions not merely as an immediate behavioral driver but as a relational asset that is linked to the psychological capacities essential for sustainable organizational behavior. This study contributes to the theory by integrating JD-R and SET perspectives to explain how relational and psychological resources are jointly related to OCB. While the primary focus was on mediation, future research should test potential moderation effects, such as how job demands or emotional labor may shape the strength of these pathways—aligning with the JD-R model’s interactive assumptions. Practically, the results suggest that airline organizations and other service industries can promote sustainable human resource management by cultivating trust-based relational capital and strengthening employees’ PsyCap through targeted training, mentoring, and supportive leadership practices. These insights extend beyond aviation to other service sectors characterized by high emotional labor demands, offering a pathway to strengthen human resource sustainability and organizational social sustainability. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>How positive psychological capital promotes service recovery performance through mental health and work engagement: Does service climate matter?</title> <abstract>Purpose – This study aims to examine the contribution of positive psychological capital (PsyCap) to service recovery performance (SRP) through the mediating roles of mental health (MH) and work engagement (WE). Additionally, it considers the moderating role of service climate (SC). Design/methodology/approach – The research utilized a self-report questionnaire completed by a sample of 391 Vietnamese Airlines flight attendants. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings – The results indicated that PsyCap does not directly influence SRP; instead, the effect of PsyCap on SRP is fully mediated by MH and WE. Furthermore, when flight attendants perceive their organization as fostering a favorable service climate, the impact of WE on SRP is strengthened. Practical implications – The author proposes practical strategies to enhance service recovery among Vietnamese Airlines flight attendants. These insights provide valuable information for the sector, empowering decision-makers. Originality/value – This research makes a significant contribution to the limited academic literature on the subject by providing statistical evidence of the relationships among a set of variables. While PsyCap is recognized as a crucial personal resource in service industries, there is a lack of research on its impact within the airline sector.

The participants were 171 active duty F-15 A/C pilots who completed a test battery representative of various psychological constructs proposed or demonstrated to be valid for the prediction of performance in a wide variety of military and civilian jobs. These predictors encompassed measures of cognitive ability, psychomotor ability, and personality. Supervisor and peer ratings of SA were collected. Supervisors and peers showed substantial agreement on the SA ratings of the pilots. The first unrotated principle component extracted from the supervisor and peer ratings accounted for 92.5% of the variability of ratings. The unrotated first principal component served as the SA criterion. Flying experience measured in number of F-15 hours was the best predictor of SA. After controlling for the effects of F-15 flying hours, the measures of general cognitive ability based on working memory, spatial reasoning, and divided attention were found to be predictive of SA. Psychomotor and personality measures were not predictive.

Information requests were made apparent by eliminating access to standard tower information sources. Instead, controllers were required to ask for precisely the information they needed during the scenarios. The information requests were classified using an elaboration of Zwaan and Radvansky's (1998) dimensions of situation models. The vast majority of requests were about three of the dimensions originally developed for reading comprehension: the protagonist, intentionality, and space. The information requests were also classified into 28 operational categories (e.g., aircraft identification, destination). From these results, the data were summarized, not just statistically, but by the creation of display-hypotheses. The display-hypotheses were organized according to the situation-model dimensions. Controllers preferred data blocks organized by the situation-model principle over those that violated this organization. The summary display-hypotheses were quite simple and accounted for the vast majority of the information requests controllers made. The display-hypotheses accounted for the information needs of controllers during routine as well as off-nominal events. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"", '<title>Comprehensive Evaluation of Remote Tower Controllers’ Situation Awareness Level Based on the Entropy Weight Method (EWM)–TOPSIS–Gray Relational Analysis Model</title> <abstract>In recent years, the rapid development of remote tower technology has made it crucial to accurately assess the situational awareness (SA) levels of remote tower controllers. Such an assessment is significant for controller training and remote tower system design. This study employed the SART scale to compare controllers’ SA scores in traditional and remote tower environments. Results revealed significant differences, especially in attention demand and situational understanding. Subsequently, a quantitative analysis of controllers’ perception, understanding, and decision-making abilities was conducted, integrating subjective and objective data. Eye-tracking, heart rate, working memory scales, and communication-coordination scales showed significant results. Experienced controllers had better psychological safety skills, while trainees were more likely to increase vigilance. Moreover, a series of sensitive SA indicators were identified. An evaluation index system was established using the entropy weight method. By calculating the Euclidean distance, Gray relational degree, and comprehensive proximity coefficient, the SA levels of controllers were comprehensively evaluated. The top five important indicators were average blink rate, scan length, average fixation duration, fixation duration, and average pupil diameter. These findings support enhancing air traffic control safety and refining SA assessment for remote tower controllers. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>', ""<title>Individual differences in mental imagery experience: Developmental changes and specialization</title> <abstract>This research has two purposes: (1) to study developmental changes and differences in visual and movement imagery in male and female children and adults; (2) to investigate whether systematic differences in imagery vividness can be measured in specialist groups. In Study 1, the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire and the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire were administered to 547 individuals in age groups from 7–8 to 50 + years of age. Significant increases in imagery vividness were found in females at 8–9 and in males at 10–11 years. In general females report more vivid imagery than males but at about 50 females' movement imagery reduced in vividness. In Studies 2–5 imagery differences in specialist groups were examined using the same two questionnaires with a total of 655 participants.

New concepts implemented with a view to increasing capacity and efficiency should at least be safety-neutral. Because of the enormous impact of the introduction of new air traffic management systems, their basic concepts have to be evaluated prospectively. With the increasing automation during the nineties, the concept of situation awareness (SA) became accepted as a potential indicator for safety. Among the considerable number of methods that have been developed to measure SA, no method has been validated or applied to evaluate future ATM-concepts like the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The approach of SAGAT is based on the assumption that the set of task environments' elements that are relevant for SA is independent of the dynamics within the task environment. Empirical evidence was found that this assumption can not be held in the ATC-domain. A new method to measure SA in ATC, called SALSA, has been developed. This measure takes into account that air traffic controllers use an event based mental representation of the air traffic. The SALSA and the SAGAT SA-measure have been compared in an evaluation study of a new ATM-concept. Results indicate that the method SALSA is feasible and more suitable than SAGAT to evaluate prospectively future ATM-concepts with regards to their impact on safety. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Results: The mean ratings of nausea for the subjects who were re-exposed to the optokinetic drum after 1 mo were 9.23 for the initial exposure and 0.94 for the re-exposure session. EGG indicators of motion sickness were 6.65 for the initial exposure and 1.03 for the re-exposure session. The mean ratings of nausea for the subjects who were re-exposed to the optokinetic drum after 1 yr were 8.94 for the initial exposure and 6.88 for the re-exposure session. EGG indicators of motion sickness were 5.97 for the initial exposure and 4.05 for the re-exposure session. Conclusion: These results indicated that adaptation to the motion sickness eliciting stimulation of optokinetic rotation is almost completely retained for 1 mo and partially retained for 1 yr.</abstract>"", ""<title>Neuropsychiatric observations of proprioceptive sensitivity in motion sickness susceptibility</title> <abstract>The assessment of motion sickness susceptibility is still an unsolved problem, due in part to its unclear etiology. We studied 16 referred patients suffering from 'idiopathic motion sickness' and 4 pilots suffering from motion airsickness. All clinical and neurological tests proved negative, including electroencephalograms, electronystagmograms, Doppler studies, and computerized tomography of the brain. Cervical spine X-rays and personality characteristics were assessed. Simultaneously, 35 asymptomatic pilots and pilot applicants were studied as controls. Both groups were exposed to cross-coupled accelerations on a Barany chair at 15 rpm along with 0.5 Hz head flexions. The pathological group showed a straightened cervical curvature as well as a significantly higher degree of malaise (scale of Graybiel and Lackner). Their personalities were highly alexithymic or obsessive compared to the control group (Kruskal-Wallis Test). Alexithymic and obsessive personalities may express their stress reactions and psychic conflicts through somatic signs, such as cervical muscle contractures; consequently, straightening the cervical spine with the subsequent alteration of proprioceptive inputs to the vestibular nuclei may increase motion sickness susceptibility.</abstract>"", '<title>Sea Voyage Training and Motion Sickness Effects on Working Ability and Life Quality After Landing</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: The effects of seasickness on working performance during motion exposure have been reported, while the aftereffects on working ability and life quality decline (WLD) still remain unclarified. METHODS: Two cohorts of healthy male Chinese subjects received either a single (SSV) or repeated (RSV) sea voyage training program on different vessels. A seasickness incidence (SSI) questionnaire was administered to assess the prevalence of seasickness symptoms (vomiting, nausea, other, or no symptoms). A WLD questionnaire was used to survey the general feeling of WLD (severe, moderate, slight, and none) by a 4-point score as well as the incidence rate (IR) of specific WLD items within 24 h after landing. RESULTS: The RSV cohort had lower overall IR of WLD than the SSV cohort (54.64% vs. 63.78%, N 5 657 for both cohorts). The landing ship trainees in both cohorts showed higher general WLD score and higher IRs of physical fatigue, sleep disorder, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those trained on the small vessels. Subjects with vomiting or nausea had higher general WLD score and higher IRs of concentration distraction, physical fatigue, anorexia, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those with no symptoms. Higher IRs of firing accuracy decline (SSV: 21.35% vs. 7.13%, 9.14%; RSV: 22.11% vs. 9.28%, 5.27%), equipment operation disturbance (SSV: 16.85% vs. 3.57%, 6.85%; RSV: 20.47% vs. 7.85%, 7.03%) were also observed in the vomiting subjects than those with other symptoms and no symptoms.

Susceptibility to motion sickness was determined by scores on a motion sickness questionnaire (MSQ); only individuals with extreme scores were considered for inclusion in the experimental groups. The following tests were administered: Floor Ataxia Test Battery, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, Cornell Medical Index, Cornell Word Form, Eysenck Personality Inventory, Rotter Internal External Locus of Control Scale, and the 16 Personality Factors test. Each subject was tested on at least three, but not more than six, of the eight tests. Significant sex differences were obtained on the ataxia battery and the Cornell Medical Index. Susceptible subjects did not differ significantly from nonsusceptibles on the ataxia battery but did differ significantly on all personality tests except the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (administered only to women) and the Rotter Scale. The generally consistent and significant patterns of results from the psychological tests probably reflect the selection factors used in defining the subject groups; certain personality characteristics are associated with a high degree of susceptibility to motion sickness.</abstract>', '<title>Sex differences in tolerance to visually-induced motion sickness</title> <abstract>Background: Women report a history of motion sickness (MS) about twice as frequently as men, but the results of experimental studies are equivocal. In the present investigation, we sought to replicate previous findings that women report a greater history of MS than men when interrogated with MS history questionnaires. We examined the hypothesis that those reporting that they are prone to MS are less likely to volunteer for MS provocative experiments than those who are MS resistant. Finally, using a subset of these participants, we exposed men and women, during two separate sessions, to visually elicited apparent motion, with and without voluntary head motion (pseudo-Coriolis stimulation), to examine any differences in MS elicited between these two groups on exposure to such motion stimulation. Method: Experiment 1 used a MS History Questionnaire, which included an opportunity for male and female participants to volunteer for ""psychology experiments"" in the coming semester. This instrument was used to determine effects of sex and volunteer status on motion sickness susceptibility (MSS). Experiment 2 involved exposing a subset of these participants to rotation of a vertically striped rotating drum under static and head movement conditions. Measures of vection and MS were recorded. Results: We found higher MSS scores in women vs. men, particularly when looking at participants who elected to volunteer. Women in the second experiment reported significantly more MS, but they exhibited less tolerance with head movement. No significant differences in vection were observed. Conclusions: The results indicate that laboratory manipulations that are more provocative of MS reveal reliable sex differences. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>']"

A refinement in affective stress analysis has enabled two subtypes of stress to be demonstrated: one is characterized by activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and subjective feelings of rage, fear, anxiety, or frustration; the other by excessive rumination. These two subtypes are found in differing personality configurations. Ten pilots exhibiting the former type of stress, and 6 with the latter, sought personal counselling regarding domestic problems. They underwent a regimen of 1 h weekly sessions consisting of a psychometric assessment, a psychophysiological evaluation of stress, and a complex ILS task in a specially modified type D4 Link Trainer. The performance of both groups, in terms of deviations from zero and RT to cockpit drill, was found to differ significantly from the standardized norms obtained from control groups in earlier studies, and to differ significantly from each other. The SNS aroused group showed maximum impairment at the beginning of the 20 min flight task, but gradually improved with time. The Ruminative group showed less, but consistent, impairment throughout the task. Overcontrolling was a characteristic of the former group, while errors of omission characterized the latter.

The Quick coherence technique (QCT) is an effective intervention tool to improve stress resilience and psychophysiological balance based on a five-minute paced breathing exercise with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback. The current research reports on the application of QCT training within an international airline to improve commercial pilots’ psychological health and support cognitive functions. Forty-four commercial pilots volunteered in a one-month training programme to practise self-regulated QCT in day-to-day life and flight operations. Pilots’ stress index, HRV time-domain and frequency-domain parameters were collected to examine the influence of QCT practice on the stress resilience process. The results demonstrated that the QCT improved psychophysiological indicators associated with stress resilience and cognitive functions, in both day-to-day life and flight operation settings. HRV fluctuations, as measured through changes in RMSSD and LF/HF, revealed that the resilience processes were primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activities that are important in promoting pilots’ energy mobilization and cognitive functions, thus QCT has huge potential in facilitating flight performance and aviation safety. These findings provide scientific evidence for implementing QCT as an effective mental support programme and controlled rest strategy to improve pilots’ psychological health, stress management, and operational performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

The attitude indicator (AI) is crucial for pilots to maintain spatial orientation. This study aims to investigate pilot performance with the original and a modified AI under stress and nonstress conditions. METHODS: T here were 52 pilots recruited and divided into a control group and a stress group. The stress group underwent the Trier Social Stress Test to induce acute stress, while the control group performed a nonstress task. Both groups then completed flight attitude recovery tasks using the original and a modified AI. The modified AI featured two white bars added around the original AI to enhance the display of the aircraft’s attitude. RESULTS: T he stress group exhibited significantly higher heart rates (88.01 ± 14.03 bpm) and subjective anxiety scores (35.82 ± 9.41) compared to the control group (83.22 ± 6.57 bpm; 32.26 ± 5.81). In the control group, accuracy with the modified AI (94.9% ± 5.1%) was significantly higher than with the original AI (91.8% ± 6.6%). Additionally, the modified AI reduced pitch reversal errors and roll reversal errors. In the stress group, the modified AI increased accuracy for smaller initial pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. DISCUSSION: T he addition of visual cues in the periphery of the AI improved performance under nonstressed conditions. Under stress, the visual cues enhanced accuracy for smaller pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. These findings provide insights for the ergonomic design of cockpit instruments. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Pilot Performance in Instrument-Based Tasks Under Acute Stress</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pilots often experience acute stress during flights, potentially affecting flight safety. The effect of acute stress on instrument-based tasks remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of acute stress on subjects’ performance in two crucial tasks: the attitude recovery task and the landing judgment task. METHODS: A total of 91 student pilots were divided into a control group and a stress group. Both groups completed a square task, with the stress group exposed to high-intensity noise to induce acute stress. Subsequently, 42 subjects performed an attitude recovery task using two formats of the attitude indicator: moving horizon and moving aircraft. The remaining 49 subjects performed a landing judgment task with three complexity levels using a landing instrument. Heart rates, trait-state anxiety scores, response times, and accuracy of the tasks were analyzed. RESULTS: Heart rates and state anxiety scores increased following stress induction. In the attitude task, the stress group responded faster than the control group in the moving-horizon format (467.55 ms vs. 491.45 ms) but had lower accuracy (98.65% vs. 99.73%). In the moving-aircraft format, response times (stress: 454.15 ms, control: 474.73 ms) and accuracy (stress: 98.55%, control: 99.38%) showed no significant differences between the two groups. In the low-complexity landing task, the stress group (1015.79 ms) responded faster than the control group (1168.17 ms). DISCUSSION: The impact of acute stress on performance depends on task complexity and stress intensity. While stress impairs performance in complex tasks by increasing errors, it enhances performance in simpler tasks by accelerating responses without compromising accuracy. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Comparison of myocardial ischemia during intense mental stress using flight simulation in airline pilots with coronary artery disease to that produced with conventional mental and treadmill exercise stress testing</title> <abstract>Mental stress increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although laboratory mental stress often causes less myocardial ischemia than exercise stress (ES), it is unclear whether mental stress is intrinsically different or differences are due to less hemodynamic stress with mental stress. We sought to evaluate the hemodynamic and ischemic response to intense realistic mental stress created by modern flight simulators and compare this response to that of exercise treadmill testing and conventional laboratory mental stress (CMS) testing in pilots with coronary disease. Sixteen airline pilots with angiographically documented coronary disease and documented myocardial ischemia during ES were studied using maximal treadmill ES, CMS, and aviation mental stress (AMS) testing. AMS testing was done in a sophisticated simulator using multiple system failures as stressors. Treadmill ES testing resulted in the highest heart rate, but AMS caused a higher blood pressure response than CMS. Maximal ratepressure product was not significantly different between ES and AMS (25,646 vs 23,347, p = 0.08), although these were higher than CMS (16,336, p <0.0001). Despite similar hemodynamic stress induced by ES and AMS, AMS resulted in significantly less ST-segment depression and nuclear ischemia than ES. Differences in induction of ischemia by mental stress compared to ES do not appear to be due to the creation of less hemodynamic stress. In conclusion, even with equivalent hemodynamic stress, intense realistic mental stress induced by flight simulators results in significantly less myocardial ischemia than ES as measured by ST-segment depression and nuclear ischemia. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It is also significant for brain disorder diagnosis and psychological health monitoring. Mental workload induced by various factors needs to be critically examined for better decisions. This paper presents an automated model for cognitive workload assessment to provide accurate categorization on intensity of workload induced by multitasking situations. Statistical wavelets corresponding to brain frequencies act as features for categorization task. The brain analysis needs technical expertise to identify the relevant information but, due to lack of sufficient number of experts, feature selection model helps to identify the relevant features responsible to categorize cognitive workload. Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO) method has been modified using 'Logical Operators' for binary feature selection problem in the current study and evaluated based on different parameters. Results on Logical TLBO reached upto 100% for binary and multiclass classification of cognitive workload. The results also show the proposed method is converging in minimum iteration for multiclass cognitive workload. PROMETHEE based multi-criteria decision-making approach has adopted for ranking of algorithm to select the best algorithm when multiple alternatives are available. Based on study of current literature, this approach appears to be first time implemented to provide ranking of optimization algorithms.

METHODS: A total of 8 experienced U.S. Army test pilots completed 24 flights across 3 distinct route designs using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Vertical Motion Simulator, with airspeeds ranging from 120 to 240 kn. Analysis focused on EEG Beta/(Alpha + Theta) ratios as indicators of changing cognitive engagement over time. RESULTS: Analyses revealed distinct cognitive engagement patterns across routes: highly variable individual responses in routes with changing navigation demands, more consistent cognitive engagement in systematic route designs, and intermediate variability in mixed-demand routes. Airspeed effects on cognitive engagement became particularly pronounced above 200 kn, though these effects varied significantly by route and individual pilot. Temporal analysis demonstrated evolving patterns of cognitive adaptation, with routes eliciting different progression patterns over extended flight periods. Regression analysis showed that EEG Beta/(Alpha+Theta) values increased significantly during all three routes, with mean increases ranging from 0.0051-0.0146.

Periods of low cognitive workload may be followed by periods of high cognitive workload and vice versa. During such changing demands, there exists potential for increased error on behalf of the pilots due to periods of boredom or excessive cognitive task demand. To further understand cognitive workload in aviation, the present study involved collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data from ten (10) collegiate aviation students in a live-flight environment in a single-engine aircraft. Each pilot possessed a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate and either FAA class I or class II medical certificate. Each pilot flew a standardized flight profile representing an average instrument flight training sequence. For data analysis, we used four main sub-bands of the recorded EEG signals: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Power spectral density (PSD) and log energy entropy of each sub-band across 20 electrodes were computed and subjected to two feature selection algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE) and lasso cross-validation (LassoCV), and a stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm composed of support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Also, hyperparameter optimization and tenfold cross-validation were used to improve the model performance, reliability, and generalization. The feature selection step resulted in 15 features that can be considered an indicator of pilots' cognitive workload states. Then these features were applied to the stacking ensemble algorithm, and the highest results were achieved using the selected features by the RFE algorithm with an accuracy of 91.67% (± 0.11), a precision of 93.89% (± 0.09), recall of 91.67% (± 0.11), F-score of 91.22% (± 0.12), and the mean ROC-AUC of 0.93 (± 0.06). The achieved results indicated that the combination of PSD and log energy entropy, along with well-designed machine learning algorithms, suggest the potential for the use of EEG to discriminate periods of the low, medium, and high workload to augment aircraft system design, including flight automation features to improve aviation safety. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract>"", '<title>Chirplet transform-based machine-learning approach towards classification of cognitive state change using galvanic skin response and photoplethysmography signals</title> <abstract>Recent advances in the field of cognitive sciences have provided evidence to classify activities with different cognitive engagement levels. High cognitive load and sustained attention may predispose an individual to psychological and physical stress and may result in a lack of performance. Cognitive load monitoring of professionals in high precision fields has gathered significant attention in the current research scenario. The proposed work in continuity has tried to demonstrate the use of two non-invasive physiological sensing modalities viz. galvanic skin response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG) to elucidate effectiveness in picking up differences of two induced cognitive state categories based on machine learning and statistical methods. This paper demonstrates how GSR and PPG signals data can be effectively utilized to examine the shift in cognitive load. The present work proposes the use of general linear chirplet transform (GLCT) to evaluate the time-frequency characteristic of GSR and PPG signals and utilize the statistical features in classification. Random Forest, Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbours demonstrated an accuracy of 92.13%, 88.0%, and 86.13% respectively on a dataset of 20 subjects against an optimized feature set, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for differentiating pre-defined categories of cognitive load. The study shows the potential of GSR and PPG signals attributes and time-frequency representation using GLCT to monitor cognitive load in real-life conditions. The proposed work also indicates the possibility to extend the same to attention-demanding fields such as aviation, medicine, and manufacturing for effective remediation of fatigue periods with increased cognitive demand, which, if sustained, may lead to cognitive decline in the long run. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Workload state classification with automation during simulated air traffic control</title> <abstract>Real-time operator workload assessment and state classification may be useful for decisions about when and how to dynamically apply automation to information processing functions in aviation systems. This research examined multiple cognitive workload measures, including secondary task performance and physiological (cardiac) measures, as inputs to a neural network for operator functional state classification during a simulated air traffic control (ATC) task. Twenty-five participants performed a low-fidelity simulation under manual control or 1 of 4 different forms of automation. Traffic volume was either low (3 aircraft) or high (7 aircraft). Participants also performed a secondary (gauge) monitoring task. Results demonstrated significant effects of traffic volume (workload) on aircraft clearances (p < .01) and trajectory conflicts (p < .01), secondary task performance (p < .01), and subjective ratings of task workload (p < .01). The form of ATC automation affected the number of aircraft collisions (p < .05), secondary task performance (p < .01), and heart rate (HR; p < .01). However, heart rate and heart rate variability measures were not sensitive to the traffic manipulation. Neural network models of controller workload (defined in terms of traffic volume) were developed using the secondary task performance and simple heart rate measure as inputs. The best workload classification accuracy using a genetic algorithm (across all forms of ATC automation) was 64%, comparable to prior work. Additional neural network models of workload for each mode of ATC automation revealed substantial variability in predictive accuracy, based on the characteristics of the automation. Secondary task performance was a highly sensitive indicator of ATC workload, whereas the heart rate measure appeared to operate as a more global indicator of workload. A limited range of cardiac response might be sufficient for the demands of the brain in ATC. The results have applicability to design of future adaptive systems integrating neural-network-based workload state classifiers for multiple forms of automation.

We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood. METHODS: There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality. RESULTS: Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (20.59, 20.52, and 0.32 mS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline (Δ = 1.2 and Δ = 1.1 points), but the control scene did not (Δ = 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect (Δ = 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene (Δ = 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).

To systematically understand the impact of SD, it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze pilots’ flight performance and mental stress, and to verify the effectiveness of verbal reports (VR) in enabling pilots to deal with an SD situation. This study investigated the effects of VR execution and type of SD on flight performance and mental stress. METHODS: SD simulation experiments were conducted on 30 Air Force fighter pilots (15 in the VR group and 15 in the non-VR group) with electrocardiography (ECG) sensors attached. The pilots gave their VRs by immediately verbalizing their attention to instrument information and six potentially disorientating scenarios were implemented in each flight phase. Flight performance was analyzed using instructor evaluation and self-evaluation scores, and mental stress was measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and perceived distress score. RESULTS: In maintaining flight performance, the VR group, respectively, had 8% and 10% higher scores for altitude and speed than the non-VR group. The self-evaluation scores were lowest for Coriolis, while Graveyard Spin was scored lowest in the instructor evaluations. Regarding mental stress, the VR group tended to have higher HFs and lower LF/HF ratios among HRV measures than the non-VR group, and an 11% lower perceived distress score. The highest perceived distress score was for Coriolis.

It was assumed that visual illusion tends to cause spatial disorientation (SD). The question was asked which orientation of the sloping cloud (right/left) would have a bigger impact on SD. The effectiveness of the flight profile performance under the influence of visual illusion was analyzed in the context of the field dependence (FD), field independence (FI) or field intermediate dependence (FINT) of perception, the effectiveness of attention and operational memory. Material and Methods: The study covered 66 pilots. A flight simulator was used as a measure of effectiveness in performing the flight profile in spatial disorientation conditions. The effectiveness of attention and working memory was diagnosed using 4 computer tasks. Results: It was revealed that the right sloping cloud (compared to the left sloping cloud) had a greater impact on military pilots’ behavior. The cognitive style distinguishes the accuracy of the flight profile performance from the inclined cloud pointing to the right. The comparisons showed significant differences between the FI and FD pilot groups. All the pilots demonstrated the right-sided asymmetry of the flight rate. While performing tasks on the simulator, the FI pilots were characterized by a more stable rate than the FINT pilots. Conclusions: A general conclusion is that the “correct falling cloud” had a greater impact on pilots’ behavior. The presented results confirm the hypothesis that susceptibility to visual illusions is significantly increased in the pilots characterized by field dependence while the pilots with the FINT style of perception are characterized by a greater variability of the flight rate. © 2019 Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

Spatial disorientation accounts for 20-38% of fatal military aviation accidents, but case reports describing specific illusions during actual flight are rare. CASE REPORT: On a clear night, an aerial refueling tanker was cruising at 16,000 ft (4877 m), while an F-15I fighter aircraft was 3 mi behind and 971 ft (296 m) below. About 100 s before a near collision, the fighter pilot switched to Air-to-Air mode, displaying the distance and speed difference to the tanker via a Target Designator box on the Head-Up Display. However, the crew did not realize they were accelerating toward the tanker [from 597-663 ft · s-1 (182-202 m · s-1)] or climbing by 738 ft (225 m). The two aircraft came within 49 ft (15 m) of each other before the navigator noticed the tanker and initiated a roll to the left. DISCUSSION: The dip illusion occurs when a pilot flying in trail attempts to maintain the image of the lead aircraft in a fixed position on the windscreen as separation increases, which can lead to unintentional descent. In this case, we propose a ""reverse-dip"" illusion. The fighter crew was unaware they were closing in on the tanker, causing the Target Designator box to rise in the Head-Up Display. The pilot instinctively pulled back on the stick to maintain the box\'s position, resulting in an unintentional climb. Recognizing how such illusions develop in flight is essential to reducing future risks. Nakdimon I, Gordon B. Spatial disorientation event during flight due to proposed reverse-dip visual illusion.

Background: SD frequently occurs in military rotary-wing operations and often contributes to mishaps. Effects of SD stimuli on pilots are usually quantified using control errors, but effects on cognition have not yet been successfully quantified. Method: Military helicopter pilots (n = 14) performed scenarios with six SD stimuli (SD condition) and six corresponding control stimuli (NoSD condition) in a motion-base simulator with integrated virtual reality headset. SD stimuli were: false horizon, featureless terrain, leans, brownout, a somatogyral yaw illusion, and loss of horizon due to night vision goggles (NVGs). Mental workload was measured using auditory arithmetic task performance and attentional focus was measured using eye-tracking. Results: Average arithmetic task performance was significantly impaired, and proportional gaze dwell time on the attitude indicator was significantly increased in the SD compared to the NoSD condition. Of the six SD stimuli, the featureless terrain, the leans, and the brownout induced significant effects on performance, whereas the featureless terrain, brownout, and false horizon significantly affected gaze behavior. The NVGs and somatogyral yaw stimuli did not induce significant effects. Pilots’ self-reports indicated awareness of all SD stimuli, except for the featureless terrain. Conclusion: The results indicate that SD impacts pilot mental workload and attentional focus. Application: Modern military aircraft present a large volume of mission-related information to pilots. This study shows that SD stimuli may negatively impact the processing of such information. © 2025 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

In general, there appears to be a wide range of practice in the design and implementation of behavioral markers systems within CRM programs. Emerging issues relating to content validity of marker systems and rater reliability are likely to become the focus of both researchers' and pilots' interest.</abstract>"", '<title>Aviation Computer Games for Crew Resource Management Training</title> <abstract>Crew resource management (CRM) training programs have existed for more than a decade, yet methods for providing aircrews with opportunities to practice CRM skills have been limited to role plays in class and scenarios in operational flight trainers. There are drawbacks to both training methods; role plays have few, if any, realistic environmental cues to help crews behave as they do in the cockpit, and simulator scenarios are limited by the cost and availability of the simulators. Research using inexpensive, tabletop computer-based simulations as CRM training media was conducted with military aircrews. Reactions of the crewmembers taking part in the research were very positive both in their acceptance of the system in general and as a trainer for CRM skills. This article presents this research and reports the reactions of aircrews to the tabletop simulation. In addition, a series of recommendations are provided regarding the implementation and use of this low-fidelity simulation. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This article outlines the development of a European NTS behavioral marker system for crew resource management evaluation called NOTECHS and presents preliminary results from an ongoing-test phase of this system (Joint Aviation Requirements Translation and Elaboration of Legislation [JARTEL]). The JARTEL project has involved 105 instructors from 14 European airlines who were given a short training session to use the NOTECHS system. After the training phase, these instructor pilots used the system to evaluate the individual CRM skills of captains and first officers in 8 different video scenarios filmed in a Boeing 757 simulator. Issues relating to rater training, reliability, and accuracy, as well as the instructors' opinions on the acceptability of the method, are discussed.</abstract>"", ""<title>Assessing the effectiveness of bridge resource management training</title> <abstract>Bridge resource management (BRM) is the maritime equivalent of crew resource management (CRM), and has been used in the civilian maritime industry for over a decade. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the U.S. Navy's BRM training was carried out by assessing the attitudes toward, and knowledge of, the human factors that contribute to accidents in high-risk organizations. A comparison was made between surface warfare officers (SWOs) who had and had not attended BRM training. The responses of the SWOs were also compared to CRM-trained U.S. Naval aviators. It was found that BRM training did not have a significant effect on the attitudes and knowledge of SWOs. Further, naval aviators were significantly more knowledgeable, and generally held attitudes toward the human factors that are causal to accidents in high-risk organizations than did SWOs. It was concluded that the Navy's BRM training is not having the impact on knowledge and attitudes that is typical of the CRM training reported in the literature. It is proposed that the main reason for the lack of effectiveness of the BRM program is that the content of the training was not based on a needs assessment carried out within the surface warfare community.</abstract>"", '<title>The evolution and effectiveness of Maintenance Resource Management (MRM)</title> <abstract>Maintenance resource management (MRM) is defined as collaboration and communication for maintenance safety.

These states cannot be changed independent of each other through the aircraft control devices, the elevator and the throttle. Rather, to effectively change an aircraft's speed and altitude, the controls have to be coordinated. The mediating mechanism that underlies the coordination of the controls is the management of the aircraft's energy state. This article shows that the abstraction hierarchy (AH; Rasmussen, 1986) framework can be effectively used to gain more insight into the underlying structure of the aircraft energy management problem. The derived AH representation is based on the analysis of the energy constraints on the control task. It reveals the levels of abstraction necessary to link the aircraft's physical controls to the speed and altitude goals and also how the aircraft energy is a critical mediating state of the control problem. Energy awareness can be increased by presenting explicit energy management information. The powerful and novel concepts of the total energy reference profile and energy angle are introduced in this article and applied in the context of a perspective flight-path display. The resulting display presents energy management information fully integrated with the tunnel-in-the-sky display and reveals 5 new and important energy cues, intuitively linking the controls and the goals.

The goal of DAIs is to anticipate informational needs or desires of the user and provide that information without the requirement of an explicit control input by the user. DAIs have the potential to improve overall human-machine system performance if properly designed; they also have a very real potential to degrade performance if they are not properly designed. This article explores both theoretical and practical issues in the design of DAIs. The relation of the DAI concept to decision aiding and automation is discussed, and a theoretical framework for design is outlined. A preliminary investigation of the DAI design concept was conducted in the domain of aviation (precision, low-level navigation). Nontraditional controls (a force reflecting stick) and displays (a configurai flight director) were developed to support performance at the task. A standard interface (conventional controls and displays), a candidate interface (alternative controls and displays), and an adaptive interface (dynamically alternating between the standard and candidate displays) were evaluated. The results indicate that significant performance advantages in the quality of route navigation were obtained with the candidate and adaptive interfaces relative to the standard interface; no significant differences between the candidate and adaptive interfaces were obtained. The implications of these results are discussed, with special emphasis on their relation to fundamental challenges that must be met for the DAI concept to be a viable design alternative.</abstract>', '<title>Multimodal Information Presentation in Support of NextGen Operations</title> <abstract>Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of visual, auditory, tactile, and redundant auditory-visual information presentation in the context of a medium-fidelity ‘Next Generation Air Transportation System’ (NextGen) flight simulation. Background: Data overload, especially in the visual channel, and associated breakdowns in monitoring represent a major challenge in aviation. These problems are expected to worsen with NextGen, which will require pilots to manage increased amounts of data and adopt new responsibilities. The introduction of multimodal interfaces (interfaces that distribute information across multiple sensory channels) has been proposed as a means to offload the overburdened visual channel and thus address data overload. Method: Experienced commercial airline pilots completed 2 scenarios using a medium-fidelity flight simulator. For each scenario, NextGen tasks and events were presented either using technology that is currently available (visual and auditory displays) or technology proposed as part of NextGen design concepts (i.e., tactile and redundant displays). Performance was measured based on response time and accuracy. Results: Faster responses were observed for redundant displays, compared to either vision or audition alone. No significant benefit of redundancy was found for accuracy and workload did not mediate redundancy effects. For traffic events, there were faster response times with tactile displays, but higher response accuracy with auditory displays. Conclusion: The findings from this research add to the knowledge base in multimodal information processing and can inform the design of displays for NextGen operations. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Improved Usability of Aviation Automation Through Direct Manipulation and Graphical User Interface Design</title> <abstract>Problems in advanced commercial aircraft pilot-flight management system (FMS) interaction through multifunction control display units (MCDUs) have been widely reported. Because this interaction plays an important role in ensuring aircraft safety, the MCDU should be designed to provide intuitive interfaces for ease of learning and use and to support pilot task performance in every aspect possible. Because of the increased complexity of computer-based systems, direct manipulation (DM) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been proposed as vehicles to facilitate user-friendly interface design for improved usability of computer-based systems. This article takes a systematic approach toward the usability analysis of MCDU design; specifically it considers the application of foundational usability principles to aviation automation. The properties and advantages of DM and GUI design are reviewed from the perspective of MCDU design. In addition, discussion is provided on a usability inspection conducted on the MCDU interface design by human factors professionals. After this, general human-computer interaction design guidelines and recommendations on aspects of DM and GUIs relevant to the interface of the MCDU are formulated on the basis of previous empirical or analytical studies. The implications of specific usability design principles on the MCDU design, as suggested in the literature and by the usability judges, are also discussed in the constrained context of FMS operations with specific examples detailing how principles could be achieved and used to address aviation automation issues.</abstract>', '<title>Cognitive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions for Unmanned Aircraft</title> <abstract>This paper presents the concept of Cognitive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (CHMI2) for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Ground Control Stations (GCS). CHMI2 represents a new approach to aviation human factors engineering that introduces adaptive functionalities in the design of operators’ command, control and display functions. A CHMI2 system assesses human cognitive states based on measurement of key psycho-physiological observables. The cognitive states are used to predict and enhance operator performance in the accomplishment of aviation tasks, with the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall human-machine teaming. The CHMI2 system presented in this paper employs a four-layer architecture comprising sensing, extraction, classification and adaptation functionalities. An overview of each layer is provided along with the layer’s metrics, algorithms and functions. Two relevant case studies are presented to illustrate the interactions between the different layers, and the conceptual design of the associated display formats is described. The results indicate that specific eye tracking variables provide discrimination between different modes of control. Furthermore, results indicate that the higher levels of automation supported by the CHMI2 are beneficial in Separation Assurance and Collision Avoidance (SA&CA) scenarios involving low-detectability obstacles and stringent time constraints to implement recovery manoeuvres. These preliminary results highlight that the introduction of CHMI2 functionalities in future UAS can significantly reduce reaction time and enhance operational effectiveness of unmanned aircraft response to collision and loss of separation events, as well as improve the overall safety and efficiency of operations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</abstract>']"

However, little is known about the nature and causes of problems that arise in pilot-automation interaction. In this article, we report the results of two studies that provide converging, complementary data on pilots’ difficulties with understanding and operating one of the core systems of cockpit automation, the Flight Management System (FMS). As vehicles to gather a corpus on the nature and variety of FMS-related problems, we used a survey asking pilots to describe specific incidents with the FMS, and we used the observations of pilots undergoing transition training to a glass cockpit aircraft. The results of both studies indicate that pilots become proficient in standard FMS operations through ground training and subsequent line experience. But even with considerable line experience, they still have difficulties tracking FMS status and behavior in certain flight contexts, and they show gaps in their understanding of the functional structure of the system. The results suggest that design-related factors such as opaque interfaces contribute to these difficulties, which can affect pilots’ situation awareness. The results of this research are relevant for both the design of cockpit automation and the development of training curricula specifically tailored to the needs of glass cockpits. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

As long as humans are in the loop, over a half century of research in human factors suggests that this hope is unlikely to become a reality unless careful attention is paid to human behavior and, conversely, the potential for harm is real if little attention is given to said behavior. Different challenges lie with each of the two middle levels of automation which are the primary focus of this article. With Level 2 automation (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; NHTSA), the driver is removed from always having to control the position and speed of the vehicle, but is still required to monitor both position and speed. Humans are notoriously bad at vigilance tasks, and can quickly lose situation awareness. Moreover, even if vigilant, the driver needs to interact with the vehicle. But voice-activated systems which let the driver continue to glance at the forward roadway are proving to be a potential source of cognitive distraction. With Level 3 automation (NHTSA), the driver is out of the loop most of the time, but will still need to interact with the vehicle. Critical skills can be lost over time. Unexpected transfers of control need to be considered. The surface transportation and aviation human factors communities have proposed ways to solve the problems that will inevitably arise, either through careful experimentation or extensions of existing research.</abstract>', '<title>Pilot Interaction With Cockpit Automation II: An Experimental Study of Pilots’ Model and Awareness of the Flight Management System</title> <abstract>Technological developments have made it possible to automate more and more functions on the commercial aviation flight deck and in other dynamic high-consequence domains. This increase in the degrees of freedom in design has shifted questions away from narrow technological feasibility. Many concerned groups, from designers and operators to regulators and researchers, have begun to ask questions about how we should use the possibilities afforded by technology skillfully to support and expand human performance. In this article, we report on an experimental study that addressed these questions by examining pilot interaction with the current generation of flight deck automation. Previous results on pilot-automation interaction derived from pilot surveys, incident reports, and training observations have produced a corpus of features and contexts in which human-machine coordination is likely to break down (e.g., automation surprises). We used these data to design a simulated flight scenario that contained a variety of probes designed to reveal pilots’ mental model of one major component of flight deck automation: the Flight Management System (FMS). The events within the scenario were also designed to probe pilots’ ability to apply their knowledge and understanding in specific flight contexts and to examine their ability to track the status and behavior of the automated system (mode awareness). Although pilots were able to “make the system work” in standard situations, the results reveal a variety of latent problems in pilot-FMS interaction that can affect pilot performance in nonnormal time critical situations. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Twenty flight tasks supported by the FMS were analyzed using a cognitive stage model (Sherry, Polson, Feary, & Palmer, 2002) to identify steps with the potential for errors. If a step was found not to have visual cues such as labels or prompts for the required action sequence it was identified as a recall step and a potential source of difficulty. If the action was supported by salient labels and prompts it was identified as a recognition step. Actual pilots using an FMS were observed and performance and errors categorized into the related task step. The greatest amount of observed difficulty was accessing the correct function, labeled as an access error. This process was found to be particularly vulnerable to recall problems. Pilots had the likelihood of .74 for committing an access error on tasks with 2 recalled access steps. This is compared to .13 for 1 recalled access step and .06 for no recalled access steps. Errors associated with formatting, inserting, or verifying entries were less common than access errors; however, these errors primarily occurred on tasks in which recall steps were required for the related step. A total of 93% of the format errors, 80% of the insert errors, and 81% of the verify errors occurred on the tasks that did not have good recognition support for each associated step. On a positive note, experience with the new FMS in the preceding 6 months was correlated with a decrease in overall errors, r(22) = -.42, p < .05, and a decrease in errors associated with inadequate knowledge to accomplish a required step, r(22) =-.61, p <. 01.

Background: Although technology has long been an irreplaceable, valuable ally for airline pilots, artificial intelligence (AI) differs significantly from previously used technologies and pilots perceive AI not only as a tool but as an agent with human-like attributes. These anthropomorphic perceptions shape their career-related attitudes, especially as AI’s cognitive capabilities and ethical limitations challenge pilot identity. Methods: Survey data were collected from 363 commercial pilots and measures included anthropomorphic features ascribed to AI (including sociopathic AI features), perceived career threats and opportunities as well as expected performance enhancement due to AI. Regression and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. Background: Sociopathic AI features were positively associated with career threats and negatively with opportunities. Career opportunities significantly mediated the relationship between sociopathic features and perceived performance gains. Perceived career threats related to AI reduced performance expectations due to AI only when perceived career opportunities were low. Conclusions: The study offers a broad perspective on introducing artificial intelligence into the cockpit, considering commercial pilots' tendency to anthropomorphise AI. It seeks to ensure that AI can deliver operational benefits in safety and performance that meet the industry's and its end-users' needs, therefore addressing ethical concerns is critical for AI integration in aviation. © 2025 The Author(s).

The former controllers showed worse health levels, in particular minor psychological disorders and chronic fatigue. Sixteen of them had been transferred to administrative jobs because of health impairment, owing to severe diseases of the nervous, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. Such disorders, and musculoskeletal ones, were mostly reported by the active controllers. The controllers engaged in Regional Centres showed more sleep disturbances than those engaged in towers. Beside age, some personal characteristics appeared to influence health and well-being.

The human body adapts to shiftwork differently. These adjustments affect the health-disease process, predisposing ATC to risk conditions associated with sleep deprivation and lack of night sleep, which can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, anxiety, and obesity. This study investigated the characteristics of health, sleep, and quality of life of ATC exposed to 8-h alternate work shifts and 6-h rotational work shifts. Methods: The study was cross-sectional with convenience samples consisting of 84 ATC from two international airports in Brazil. We applied questionnaires to collect data about socioeconomic conditions, quality of life, sleep, and physical activity levels. We also collected health data regarding nutritional status, body composition, and blood pressure. We analyzed the differences between ATC from the two airports considering the variables of sleep, quality of life, and health. Results: Differences were found between the groups in terms of body fat percentage (30.7% and 27.8%), scores of overall quality of life (56.2 and 68), concentration (3.37 and 3.96), energy (3.12 and 3.62), and sleep time on working days (5:20 h and 6:15 h).

These professions include, among others, air traffic controllers, firefighters, and ECDs. People working in these professions are particularly vulnerable to experiencing high levels of stress and developing professional burnout syndrome. The aim of the conducted research was to assess the external and internal differences in the intensity of occupational burnout dimensions among representatives of high-risk occupations and to distinguish burnout profiles among them. (2) Methods: The total number of participants working in high–risk occupations who took part in the study was N = 1239, including the following job positions: air traffic controllers (n = 107), firefighters (n = 580), and ECDs (n = 558). The respondents completed the following self-report questionnaires: a structured survey and the Link Burnout Questionnaire. The following statistical tests were performed: cluster analysis, analysis of variance, and chi-square test of independence. (3) Results: The highest intensity of burnout dimensions was presented by representatives of ECDs. Profiles reflecting the types of occupational burnout were distinguished. The representatives of air traffic controllers demonstrated the following profiles: 1—low risk of burnout with a component of psychophysical exhaustion; 2—exhausted with a moderate tendency to disap-pointment; 3—burned out, ineffective, and uninvolved. The profiles of the ECDs were: 4—engaged, with a reduced sense of effectiveness; 5—with a reduced sense of effectiveness; 6—burned out with a low sense of effectiveness. However, the profiles of the firefighters were: 7—not burned out; 8—at risk of burnout; 9—exhausted with a tendency towards disappointment. Individuals representing the various burnout profiles differed in terms of the severity of the dimensions of occupational burnout as well as sociodemographic and work-related characteristics. (4) Conclusions: The process of occupational burnout varies among people in various high-risk occupations and due to sociodemographic characteristics. The internal differentiation of people representing high-risk professions requires different psychological interventions and preventive measures. © 2022 by the authors.

The number of aircraft under control per hour was recorded as index of workload. Recordings involved subjective ratings (mood, physical fitness, fatigue) and objective measures (hean rate, vanilJyl mandelic acid excretion, reaction times, critical flicker fusion, oral temperature). In addition, the subjects fined out questionnaires for personality traits (extroversion, neuroticis, anxiety) and behavioural characteristics (momingness, rigidity of sleeping habits, vigourness to overcome drowsiness). The volume of air traffic varied greatly with peaks during the day and low levels at night. Nevertheless, the heart rates of the group members showed quite constant levels in all the three shifts, irrespective of the workload. The same pattern appeared in the controllers' excretion of VMA, which remained high during both day and night shifts, regardless of the reduced workload. The subjective mood and physical fitness decreased similarly, while feelings of fatigue increased on all three shifts, particularly on the night shift. The circadian rhythm of the oral temperature showed a slight modification of the noctural depression during the night shift, caused by the state of awakeness and activity. However, the rhythm was not altered in its normal circadian phase, due to the fast shift rotation adopted.

Shifts of the phase of circadian periodicity manifested by the physiological functions were effected by the east-west and west-east flights but not by the north-south flight. Bidirectional differences in lag time and extent of dissociation were revealed, but these may be due to individual variability. All flights engendered significant increment in subjective fatigue.

Timed food has been shown to reset the circadian rhythm in rodents. Implementation intentions have been used to change eating behaviour. Mealtimes could therefore be used as a countermeasure to reduce jet lag and improve alertness in long-haul cabin crew through forming an implementation intention to improve the regularity of meals on days off. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a randomised controlled trial, with two conditions: forming an implementation intention to eat regular meals on days off vs. no implementation intention. Pre-intervention measurements were taken at baseline (before a long-haul trip) and post-intervention measures were taken on the first and second days off post-trip. Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) and objective alertness (Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)). Results: Mixed ANOVA showed a significant condition x time interaction for unidimensional jet lag but not for multidimensional jet lag and objective alertness. In particular, the formation of an implementation intention to alter mealtimes resulted in a reduction of unidimensional jet lag.

The extent to which changes in circadian phase relate to reported levels of jet lag remains unclear. The main aim of the present study was first to evaluate the relationship between objective (circadian phase) and subjective jet lag and second to explore the relative role of both subjective and objective psycho-behavioural factors in predicting the subjective experience of jet lag. Twenty-eight long-haul cabin crew completed questionnaires measuring diurnal preference, trip characteristics and subjective jet lag as a single and as a multidimensional measure. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and urinary melatonin peak time was measured, at baseline (T1), e.g. before a long-haul trip and post-trip on the crew's first recovery day (T2). Subjective jet lag was also measured at both time points. At T1, later circadian phase related to increased unidimensional jet lag, however, a post-trip discrepancy was found between objective and subjective uni- and multidimensional jet lag measured at T2 and change from T1 to T2. After controlling for direction and size of circadian phase, increased uni- and multidimensional subjective jet lag was predicted by depressed mood states. The regression models including phase, diurnal preference, departure time on the outbound sector and arousal levels accounted for 28% of the variance in unidimensional jet lag and 53% of the variance in multidimensional jet lag. It was concluded that there is a discordance between objective and subjective jet lag post-trip. Further, subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew is better explained by mood impairment than circadian phase. The results are discussed with reference to the gap between subjective and objective jet lag and the role of psychology rather than just biology in the jet lag experience. The implications for improving health and safety in the workplace, through a better understanding of the role of human factors in the management of jet lag, are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"", '<title>Circadian rhythms in airline pilots submitted to long-haul transmeridian flights</title> <abstract>Background: Circadian rhythms shift out of phase after transmeridian flights.

Temperature rhythms manifested a rigid response after the phase shifts of the light/dark cycle, closely related to the biological clock. Subjective time appreciation tended to be overestimated without exhibiting a clear circadian component, but attributable to fatigue and stress. Psychometric evaluation showed that desynchronization affected all the pilots. Some results showed an age-related variability with a more marked influence in younger pilots. No consistent effects regarding flight direction were found.</abstract>', '<title>Predicting jet lag in long-haul cabin crew: The role of illness cognitions and behaviour</title> <abstract>Objective: Established risk factors for jet lag are mostly physiological including circadian preference, age, gender, the number of flight zones crossed and to some extent direction of travel. Some research has also highlighted a role for psychosocial factors including sleep, diet and ‘circadian’ health behaviours and illness cognitions although this remains relatively untested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sleep, diet and illness cognitions in predicting perceived jet lag amongst long-haul crew. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a longitudinal study. Profile characteristics (including chronotype), preparation strategies (sleep, eating and ‘circadian’ behaviours) and illness cognitions were measured at baseline (before a trip). Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) was measured on the crews’ second day off (post-trip). Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that unidimensional jet lag was predicted by the belief in a cyclical timeline, whereas multidimensional jet lag was predicted by multidimensional jet lag at baseline and to a lesser extent by identity. No role was found for profile characteristics and preparation strategies. Conclusion: Illness cognitions partly explain the experience of perceived jet lag in long-haul cabin crew indicating that jet lag is in part a psycho-social construct, not just a biological one. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>']"

Background: Risk-taking is a topic that draws attention because of its link with the causation of injury. In the literature, there are a large number of papers linking personality traits to self-reported risk-taking, in addition to theoretical commentaries. In contrast, there are very few empirical studies that examine the link between personality traits, such as risk-taking and actual risk-taking behavior. Method: One hundred university students with no flying experience (59 females) and 17 pilots (five females) completed a battery of personality and risk scales. Pilots were also tasked to complete a simulated flight involving a low-level flying task. Results: The results revealed that pilots had a higher propensity for risk than the general population. However, this risk was tempered by the personality factor of self-control. Evidence of this juxtaposed position was present during the simulated flight; pilots’ propensity for risky behavior was inversely related to actual risk-taking behavior. Conclusion: These results indicate a dichotomy in risk-takers, impetuous and calculative risk-takers. These findings have important implications for pilot selection and training. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Predicting pilots risk-taking behavior through an implicit association test</title> <abstract>Objective: The Implicit Association Test (IAT), in combination with a battery of additional psychometric tests, was employed to examine the accuracy with which it predicts pilots risk-taking behavior. Background: Risk management is an integral part of piloting. Many factors affect pilots risk management, including individual differences. Therefore, employing a unique methodology from social cognition, the present study examined the influence of attitude, as measured implicitly through the IAT, personality, and flight experience variables on pilots risk-taking behavior. Method: In addition to a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator, 35 pilots completed a battery of psychometric tests. Results: Among the 6 risk perception variables, 10 risk attitude variables, and 2 experience variables, only 2 variables were found to be significantly related with in-flight risk-taking behavior: everyday risk (risk perception) and the IAT effect (attitude). Of these, the IAT effect was the strongest predictor of flight behavior. Conclusion: The results indicate that implicit attitudinal measures, such as the IAT, provide a more accurate forecast of pilot behavior than do the more traditional explicit attitudinal or personality measures. Application: An implicit attitudinal measure can be proactively employed to identify pilots who are potentially more likely to engage in high-risk activities, hence permitting a more strategic approach to pilot training. © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>', '<title>The effect of psychological risk elements on pilot flight operational performance</title> <abstract>This study aims to examine the relationship between psychological risk elements and flight operation performance for airline pilots. First, the concept of “risky pilots” is discussed, and the existence of “risky pilots” is verified using a percentage analysis of flight exceedance events. Second, three psychological risk elements for pilots are investigated using an implementation of psychological scales, and the exceedance behaviors of risky pilots are analyzed based on real flight data. Finally, correlation and cluster analyses are used to study the influence of psychological risk elements on the exceedance behaviors of airline transport pilots and their operational performance. The results indicate that approximately one-third of pilots are more prone to exceedance events than other pilots. A moderate positive linear correlation (R [44] = 0.400; p <.05) existed between hazardous attitudes and severe exceedance rates. For pilots with a high level of risk psychology, 86% of their flights were considered “poor” operational performance level. Finally, it is concluded that hazardous attitude is a psychological risk element that has significant negative effects on severe exceedance behaviors of pilots. In addition, the flight operation performance levels of pilots were also affected by the psychological risk level. Furthermore, it is suggested that special training to improve risky hazardous attitudes of pilots should be conducted for the purpose of reducing exceedance behaviors and improving flight performance. These findings are expected to provide support for airlines to identify and manage flight crew risks. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc</abstract>', '<title>The Link between Individual Predictors of Risk and Risky Flight Behavior: A Systematic Review</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to highlight how pilots’ risk perception is measured, and the relationship between individual predictors of risk and risky flight behavior. Background: Risk is an intrinsic part of life with no action void of risk. Risk-taking is mediated by several factors which include age, sex, cultural background, and personality. Understanding how pilots’ risk perception is measured allows for improved understanding of pilots’ propensity to engage in risk, and for the design of training initiatives to mitigate risky behavior. Method: A systematic review was conducted to establish the link between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior. The systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines, covering the time span between 1985 and 2021. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were revealed. Results: Three of the 16 articles employed an in-situ behavioral measure for risky flight behavior. Forecasting, where an individual predicts his/her action in a particular circumstance was the most used measure to deduce pilots’ risk-taking behavior. No predictor variable reliably predicted pilots’ risky flight behavior. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the majority of research examining the relationship between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior relies on self-reported measures or scales as opposed to in-situ performance measures such as data captured during flight or in a simulator. Such performance measures are susceptible to demand characteristics. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Cognitive Biases in Risk Communication during Post-Flight Debrief</title> <abstract>Objective: This paper aims to identify cognitive biases in risk communication among pilots during flight debrief. We evaluate the effect of framing language, representation format, and parameter type measured on how pilots interpret flight information. Background: Advancements in technology have created an opportunity for a data-centric approach to flight instruction. The understanding of virtual debrief formats, consisting of visualizations of flight data, relies on the pilot perceiving the information displayed accurately. Cognitive biases may impact how pilots perceive the information and therefore affect how they react to it in future flights. Method: We used flight data to design ways to communicate the information and developed a display prototype for the user. We asked pilots to evaluate eight different representations through a scenario-based survey. Pilots reviewed a flight and rated how risky they thought it was and the likelihood of their debrief resulting in any behavioral changes in upcoming flights. Results: Most significantly, the graphical representation format caused pilots to report a lower risk for the same flight, compared to the numerical representation format. Conclusion: The analysis of the survey has shown that debrief representation affects risk perception, but not necessarily willingness to change unsafe behaviors. Respondents were highly motivated to change unsafe behaviors, independent of how the information was presented to them. Future work should develop specific guidelines to be followed when designing debrief products. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

Normally, pilots follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during a flight. In this study, we developed a measurement named Task Complexity in Flight (TCIF) to represent the task complexity in the SOPs. Methods: The TCIF measurement combined four complexity components into one index: Actions logic complexity (ALC), actions size complexity (ASC), information control exchange complexity (ICEC), and control mode complexity (CMC).To verify the measurement, we calculated 11 tasks during the takeoffand landing phases from the SOPs, and invited 10 pilots to perform the same tasks in a flight simulator. After flight, the TCIF results were compared with two workload measure- ments: The Bedford scale and heart rate. Results: The results of TCIF and the 4 components of the 11 tasks were calculated. Further, the TCIF results showed a significant correlation with the Bedford scores (R = 0.851) and were also consistent with the difference in heart rate (R = 0.816). Therefore, with the increased TCIF results, both the Bedford scale and the difference in heart rate increased. Discussion: TCIF was proposed based on the flight operating conditions. Although additional studies of TCIF are necessary, the results of this study suggest this measurement could effectively indicate task complexity in flight, and could also be used to guide pilot training and task allocation on the flight deck. © 2015.

However, the complexity, environment, and safety considerations of flight tests require pilots to take more responsibility and be more careful with decisions and actions with higher stress, and it might be inappropriate to carry out flight tests in a high-risk abnormal situation. Therefore, it is necessary to assess workload measures in a simulator to predict workload experienced during a flight test. METHODS: Two subjective workload measurements and three psychophysiological measurements were compared both in a simulator and in a flight test among three flight scenarios. The scenarios were carried out in an ARJ21-700 full-flight simulator and a corresponding aircraft, and a total of 17 pilots participated. RESULTS: Both flight scenarios and flight environment had a significant influence on NASA-TLX, eye blink rate, and heart rate. Additionally, the NASA-TLX (R 5 0.864) and heart rate differences (R 5 0.840) presented strong correlations between the simulator and flight test. DISCUSSION: NASA-TLX and heart rate could be used in simulators and flight tests as consistent measures of workload. Furthermore, in order to reduce the quantity and risk of compliance during a flight test, the best strategy is to combine the results of the NASA-TLX scales and HR-D together in a flight simulator to predict workload experienced in a flight test. © Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>', '<title>Inflight workload assessment: Comparison of subjective and physiological measurements</title> <abstract>Introduction: Assessment of pilot workload during flight is an important aviation safety consideration. The aim of this study was to assess inflight pilot workload using both physiological and multidimensional subjective-ratings measurements (heart rate and NASA Task Load Index, respectively), comparing relative sensitivity during the four phases of flight: take-off, cruise, approach, and landing. Methods: Ten male pilots volunteered to participate in the trials, which took place in a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator. Electrocardiography was performed throughout the test using the portable Cardiovis ECG system. Mean heart rate (HR) and incremental heart rate (ΔHR) were considered indices of physiological workload. Results: Peak HR was observed during take-off (83.2 bpm) and landing (88.6 bpm); moreover, ΔHR was also greatest (14.2 bpm and 18.8 bpm). The Task Load Index (TLX) scale revealed that mental and performance demands were essential components of workload during flight. In addition, temporal demand was an important component of workload during take-off and physical demand was significant during cruise. Analysis of correlation revealed that the ΔHR is significantly related to TLX scores (r = 0.81, n = 40). Conclusions: Management of the individual sources of stress, which tend to become predominant during different flight phases, should be emphasized in periodic recurrent training. For example, a pilot must be trained to cope with the increased temporal stresses associated with take-off. In addition, the recommendations will be concerned with maintaining vigilance, task allocation between pilots, and inflight rest during long-haul cruise.</abstract>', '<title>Assessment of individual and dyadic workload of student and instructor pilots in real and simulated flight: An exploratory study</title> <abstract>Flight instructors are vital in the training of novice pilots. Just as the mental workload in student pilots fluctuates during training, so does the mental workload of the instructors, affecting their dyadic performance and judgment. This paper explored how training environments (simulated vs. real flight), flight control conditions (student pilot flying vs. monitoring), and flight phases (take-off vs. downwind vs. landing) could affect mental workload in student and instructor pilots, as well as their interpersonal coordination through electrocardiography (ECG) based measures. Student pilots performed four consecutive standard flight traffic patterns with an instructor in a simulator and in real flight, under different flight control conditions of varying workload demands, while their ECG signals were recorded. The results indicated different patterns of interpersonal coordination between simulated and real flight. The other experimental variables, i.e., flight control and flight phase, mostly had an effect on participants’ heart rate and heart rate variability. In accordance with the existing literature, heart rate increased in high workload conditions and flight phases, whilst heart rate variability decreased. Additionally, we observed a linear relationship between subjective workload and physiological synchrony which indicates that student-instructor coordination increased as the student pilot experienced more mental workload in the flight tasks. The current study highlights that individual workload as well as dyadic workload, measured through cardiac signals, can be used to evaluate student-instructor coordination during flight training as an indicator of training outcomes. © 2025 The Authors</abstract>', '<title>Investigation of Pilot Inceptor Workload and Workload Buildup Technique Through Simulator and In-Flight Studies</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates the relationship of pilot inceptor workload (PIW) with the workload buildup flight test technique (WBFTT) with various conditions of pilot workload, for objective aircraft handling qualities (HQ) evaluation. Background: HQ evaluation of a piloted aircraft remains an elusive area of flight testing, due to the existing subjective evaluation technique for the pilot workload. The pilot control inceptor being an important interface for a pilot with the aircraft, it is the best tool to estimate pilot workload. Method: The statistical model of this research involved 3 independent variables, namely aircraft flying qualities, secondary task, and boundary effect of WBFTT, each differently affecting the pilot workload. Two studies were undertaken on a fixed-base, variable-stability HQ research flight simulator with military test pilots. In-flight study of pilot inceptor movement was undertaken in an advanced jet trainer aircraft during high pilot-gain air-to-ground target tracking tasks. Results: The results of simulator studies validated the relationships of PIW and WBFTT with statistical significance from a wide set of data, with variations in pilot workload in terms of flying qualities and secondary task. The in-flight studies validated the effects of high pilot gain and proximity to ground (boundary), on the pilot inceptor movements, in training combat maneuvers. Conclusion: Studies manifested PIW as a simple and direct measure to estimate pilot workload and WBFTT as an effective technique for HQ stress testing with high pilot gain. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

However, it does not account for the time taken to make a decision, nor why response bias might change over time. Sequential sampling models provide a way of accounting for speed-accuracy trade-offs and response bias shifts. In this study, we test the validity of a sequential sampling model of conflict detection in a simulated air traffic control task by assessing whether two of its key parameters respond to experimental manipulations in a theoretically consistent way. Through experimental instructions, we manipulated participants' response bias and the relative speed or accuracy of their responses. The sequential sampling model was able to replicate the trends in the conflict responses as well as response time across all conditions. Consistent with our predictions, manipulating response bias was associated primarily with changes in the model's Criterion parameter, whereas manipulating speed- accuracy instructions was associated with changes in the Threshold parameter. The success of the model in replicating the human data suggests we can use the parameters of the model to gain an insight into the underlying response bias and speed-accuracy preferences common to dynamic decision-making tasks. © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"", '<title>Assessing the Speed–Accuracy Tradeoff in Psychological Testing Using Experimental Manipulations</title> <abstract>The speed–accuracy tradeoff (SAT), where increased response speed often leads to decreased accuracy, is well established in experimental psychology. However, its implications for psychological assessments, especially in high-stakes settings, remain less understood. This study presents an experimental approach to investigate the SAT within a high-stakes spatial ability assessment. By manipulating instructions in a within-subjects design to induce speed variations in a large sample (N = 1,305) of applicants for an air traffic controller training program, we demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating working speed. Our findings confirm the presence of the SAT for most participants, suggesting that traditional ability scores may not fully reflect performance in high-stakes assessments. Importantly, we observed individual differences in the SAT, challenging the assumption of uniform SAT functions across test takers. These results highlight the complexity of interpreting high-stakes assessment outcomes and the influence of test conditions on performance dynamics. This study offers a valuable addition to the methodological toolkit for assessing the intraindividual relationship between speed and accuracy in psychological testing (including SAT research), providing a controlled approach while acknowledging the need to address potential confounders.

However, the findings from this research have been inconsistent. Studies have varied with respect to the identification of causal variables and the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms underlying performance. Drawing on the ecological rationality approach, we present a theory of the judgment and decision-making processes involved in a relative judgment task that explains how people judge a stimulus and adapt their decision process to accommodate their own uncertainty associated with those judgments. Undergraduate participants performed a simulated air traffic control conflict detection task. Across two experiments, we systematically manipulated variables known to affect performance. In the first experiment, we manipulated the relative distances of aircraft to a common destination while holding aircraft speeds constant. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced a direct manipulation of relative speed. We then fit a sequential sampling model to the data, and used the best fitting parameters to infer the decision-making processes responsible for performance. Findings were consistent with the theory that people adapt to their own uncertainty by adjusting their criterion and the amount of time they take to collect evidence in order to make a more accurate decision.

The transfer of training experiment and the rating method are the two present-day ways of evaluating the worth of a simulator. The transfer experiment requires the trainee to practice in the simulator and then be tested in the parent aircraft to demonstrate the training value of the simulator. The rating method requires the pilot to be experienced in the parent aircraft and to rate the simulator for similarity to the aircraft. If similarity is high, the training value is assumed to be high. Arguments are presented that both of these methods are flawed. It is contended that a simulator, or any other system, need not necessarily be tested if it is based on reliable scientific laws and the success of other systems, based on the same laws, has been high. Good laws produce accurate prediction, and when outcome can be predicted it is redundant to conduct a system evaluation. With uncertainty about laws, the requirement for system testing increases.

Furthermore, research has shown that innovations in training strategies, in some cases involving intentional departures from reality, can have stronger effects than high simulator fidelity on the resulting quality of pilot performance. Ideally, each aspect of the training curriculum could be taught to some criterion performance level on the ground.

It is, therefore, surprising that there are few general methods that guide the design of simulation-based training. The lack of such methods is problematic. Due to recent factors in the aviation industry, such as advances in technology, individuals must now possess a range of skills, increasingly cognitive in nature, that must be trained and evaluated through hands-on experience. Second, training is broadening from an almost exclusive focus on individuals and teams to include multiple crews. It is clear that exercise design methodologies are needed. The purpose of this article is to describe a general approach to the design of simulation-based exercises referred to as the Event-Based Approach to Training (EBAT). Event-based techniques guide the design of training opportunities by systematically identifying and introducing events within training exercises that provide known opportunities to observe behaviors of interest.

Background: As flight simulation technology has become more advanced, and the associated costs have been reduced, there has been a corresponding increase in the use of flight simulation during ab initio phases of pilot training. Subsequently, important questions have arisen regarding the utility of simulation-based training to develop students’ rudimentary piloting skills. Method: The progression of 29 students completing a course consisting of 25% simulation is compared to a baseline sample of 62 students (sourced from historical data) completing the same course prior to the integration of additional simulation-based training. Results: The integration of simulation was found to have 2 primary impacts. Although a small decrease in aircraft training hours was evident, there was also a significant increase in the overall training time once simulation-based training was incorporated. Conclusion: Simulation will always provide significant safety and risk-reduction benefits to flight training; however, when considering the practical implications of integrating simulation-based training, the current data provide a cautionary tale that positive outcomes for training efficiency and cost-effectiveness are not always guaranteed.

Background: LVC technology is maturing but its expected training value is under-investigated, especially regarding future LVC in LFEs. Method: Fighter pilots at a Live-flying LFE answered questionnaires, 120 responses were analyzed statistically. The questions focused on whether the sortie they just flew provided training value, generally and for specific Desired Learning Objectives (DLOs), on whether the inclusion of Virtual and Constructive entities in future LFEs would contribute to training value generally and to the DLOs specifically, and on specific LVC implementation issues. Results: Ratings of experienced training value varied across DLOs, and DLO ratings varied across Mission types. Fighter pilots were positive toward including Virtual and Constructive entities in LFEs for certain DLOs, mostly for flying a complex mission. DLOs covaried around the factors of LVC-tradeoff advantages and Live advantages, as well as temporal dimensions of planning before a mission and stages of engagement. LVC implementation lessons were extracted. Conclusion: Fighter pilots are generally moderately positive about LVC in LFEs. The measurement of perceived training value per DLO seems a relevant instrument for investigating perceived training value of an LFE and expected training value of future LVC training. © 2023 Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI.

Results: In both Group I and Group III, the daily epinephrine excretion was significantly elevated during and after confinement compared with the pre-isolation baseline (p < 0.05), but remained mostly within normal limits during the experiment. During isolation, epinephrine excretion was significantly higher, compared with other weeks in isolation, during weeks #19 and #27 for Group I, and during week #30 for Group III.

Discussion: Epinephrine excretion generally remained in the normal range. However, occasional elevations occurred due to psychological stress, which apparently correlate with changes in group dynamics. Norepinephrine excretion was above the normal range and was correlated with social events.

For this purpose, an experimental wireless group structure (WLGS) monitoring system integrated into a mobile psychophysiological system was developed. In the presented study the WLGS module was evaluated separately in six male subjects (27-38 years old) participating in a 520-day simulated mission to Mars. Two days per week, each crew member wore a small sensor that registered the presence and distance of the sensors either worn by the other subjects or strategically placed throughout the isolation facility.

An integrated score of the ""crew relation time index"" was calculated and analyzed over time. Correlation analyses of a sociometric questionnaire (r =.35-.55, p<.05) and an ethological group approach (r =.45-.66, p < 05) provided initial evidence of the method\'s validity as a measure of cohesion when taking behavioral and activity patterns into account (e.g. only including activity phases in the afternoon). This confirms our assumption that the registered amount of time spent together during free time is associated with the intensity of personal relationships. © 2015 Johannes et al.</abstract>', '<title>Autonomous, computer-based behavioral health countermeasure evaluation at HI-SEAS mars analog</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Living in an isolated, confined environment (ICE) can induce conflict, stress, and depression. Computer-based behavioral health countermeasures are appealing for training and treatment in ICEs because they provide confidentiality and do not require communication with the outside environment. We evaluated the Virtual Space Station (VSS), a suite of interactive computer-delivered psychological training and treatment programs, at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) III expedition. METHODS: Six subjects (3 male, 3 female) spent 8 mo in group-isolation and used the Conflict, Stress, and Depression modules in the VSS. Survey evaluations, data collected within the program, and postdeployment interviews were collected. RESULTS: This crew dealt with behavioral health issues common to ICEs. The VSS proved to be a valuable resource and was used both as intended, and in unanticipated ways, to help maintain behavioral health. The Conflict and Stress Modules were rated as highly acceptable (1.8 on a 7-point Likert scale). The crew identified a total of 13 stressors and worked on 9 problems through the VSS. Opinions about the modules were highly individualized. Crewmembers identified exercises in the VSS that were applicable and not applicable to their needs. Additional content to improve the program was identified. DISCUSSION: Autonomous, confidential training and treatment for behavioral health issues will need to be a critical component of long duration spaceflight travel. This work provides an evaluation of such a tool in a relevant ICE. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Psychological changes and group dynamics during confinement in an isolated environment</title> <abstract>Purpose: Cultural and personal traits will become important as the number of short-duration spaceflights of international crews supporting the International Space Station (ISS) increases and more people begin staying aboard ISS for longer durations. This project investigated the interpersonal and personal changes of Japanese subjects during a 1-wk stay in the Japanese Experiment Module. The Gießen Test (GT) was used to determine if the cultural background and personality traits of the subjects become more explicit and stronger during isolation. Methods: Six males and two females aged 22-28 yr participated in the study. They stayed 7 d in the isolation chamber at the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). The GT was chosen as an individual and group diagnostic instrument; it was administrated four times during, and one time after, isolation. Results: According to the GT-self-picture, subjects exhibited a change toward negative social resonance and social withdrawal. Subgroups formed but caused no isolation or tension. The GT-foreign-pictures showed that the judgment of other subjects changed toward hedonic and permeability directions. The common interpersonal relationships of the Japanese subjects influenced the group dynamics. These relationships tend to be integrative and tend to support the network and value systems, emphasizing connectedness and minimizing differences. Conclusion: The cultural background became more explicit and stronger during isolation. Based on this, isolation studies with international crews and intercultural training will be necessary for international crews performing both short- and long-duration missions.</abstract>', '<title>Gleaning from Diaries in Long-Duration Isolation</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: a 264-d isolation simulation, sFiNcss-99, was conducted in Moscow to replicate typical scenarios on an orbital space station. One long-term group of four Russian crewmembers occupied the isolation complex for most of the duration (240 d), while two international groups of four each spent 110 d successively at the complex. additionally, there were several short visits by medical personnel. the main objective of this paper is to investigate group and individual behavioral dynamics, particularly the intercultural challenges faced during long-duration isolation, using insights from crewmembers’ diaries. METHODS: a variety of instruments and training activities, employed before, during, and after the mission, formed this multifaceted experiment. One key component, crewmembers’ diaries, is the primary data source for this analysis. RESULTS: While unstructured instruments can be challenging to analyze, these diaries proved especially useful for studying group dynamics and identifying behavioral and intercultural issues. the crewmembers found our unstructured formats, such as these journals and post-mission interviews, to be a more effective means of expressing themselves compared to structured instruments. DISCUSSION: Personal journals, open-ended questions, and the freedom from constraints typically imposed by feedback instruments used for quantitative analysis are invaluable for observing and expressing crewmembers’ psychological status, as well as inter-crew and intercultural dynamics. Personal journals can also provide a basis for constructive intervention by ground personnel, researchers, or psychologists. insights from this study can be applied to current challenges, such as the adoption of self-isolation as prevention against spread of cOViD-19.

The concept of the Pilot Advisory Group (PAG) is then discussed in detail before its role in relation to occupational stress is introduced. While some of the better known problems associated with occupational stress in pilots are mentioned, the emphasis in the paper is on developing new perspectives regarding the identification of stress-induced dysfunction, and also in exploring the suitability of PAG involvement.

Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study consisting of 42 aviators in deployed squadrons stationed overseas and involved in a contingency mission, and 15 subjects stationed in the U.S. and not exposed to combat conditions. Each subject was administered the test instrument, which was completed in privacy and with complete anonymity. Results: The hypotheses of interest were: a) the proportion of individuals in the population of fighter aircrew who would report excessive stress is 0; and b) no significant differences would exist in the proportion of individuals with excessive stress in the various squadrons. Using statistical methodology, these hypotheses were rejected.

New stress-coping models and measures for understanding and assessing these previously elusive processes greatly facilitate the empirical study of stress-coping styles. This study employed a new measure of stress-coping style, rationally developed from an integrative model of coping, to study stress-coping in U.S. Army pilots. Results indicated that the pilots preferred problem-focused stress-coping strategies oriented towards direct action to master stressful situations. Also, the pilots tended to deemphasize emotion-focused forms of coping with stress. Differences in stress-coping between pilots and samples of aircrewmen and non-rated military personnel suggest that this coping style reflects differences in psychological functioning independent from the pilots' adaptation to the aviation and military environment.</abstract>"", ""<title>Mission, physical, and war stressors' impact on aircrew psychological strain</title> <abstract>Background: Little is known about the relative impact of the organization of missions on aircrew well-being. Using an occupational stress model we investigate a previously little studied concept of mission stressors and determine its relative impact in comparison to physical and war stressors in the prediction of four strains in deployed aircrews. Method: Questionnaires were completed by 272 deployed in-aircraft crewmembers. Three new stressors were developed for this study: mission stressors, physical stressors, and war stressors. In addition, four strains were measured: PTSD, depression, sleepiness, and nervousness. Regression analyses were used to examine the relative impact of each stressor on the four strain measures while controlling for age and occupation. Results: All three stressors played a significant role in the prediction strains with the total explained variance in the analyses ranging from 15% and 39%. Interestingly, mission stressors played the most important role in the prediction of strains possessing the largest partial eta squared in each analysis. The second most important stressor was physical stressors followed by war stressors. Conclusion: The importance of mission stressors may be because current training is designed to inoculate crewmembers to stressors such as the physical/environmental conditions and violent war actions, but there is no training or acknowledgment of the importance of dealing with mission stressors. Our findings suggest it might be beneficial for commanders to address these stressors, as it may improve short-term psychological well-being, which may ultimately impact mission success and safety.</abstract>""]"

The importance of 2 particular visual experiences was evaluated: (a) the view of the world seen from the unusually steep bank at a low altitude, and (b) the visual distraction of a ""windmilling"" propeller. The influences of experience and environmental structure were also considered. Studies of these factors were conducted using a visually realistic cockpit mounted within a VisionDome® virtual reality environment. Behavioral responses were collected from both naive participants and pilot participants. The findings indicated that judgments of the position of the touchdown point made while the airplane is turning are underestimated in distance, whereas judgments made while the airplane is on a straight approach to the touchdown point are overestimated. In most cases, the windmilling propeller decreased touchdown point judgment accuracy. In addition, pilot experience was associated with improved judgment accuracy during the turning approaches. The presented environmental structure had a weak and inconsistent effect.

In an online survey, it was observed that 98% of respondents either failed to or could not accurately calculate the runway crosswind component from air traffic control (ATC) reports passed using the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard phraseology; the majority of pilots also severely underestimated the crosswind strength. Furthermore, nearly 30% of these respondents could not recall or inaccurately recalled the crosswind limit of their aircraft. In a 2nd study using a series of approach and landing trials in a general aviation simulator, wind reports were passed to participants using either the standard ICAO format or in a modified format, where the runway crosswind component was explicitly stated. The results showed that for the group receiving wind reports in the standard format, the mental arithmetic associated with calculating the runway crosswind impaired flying performance. As with the online survey, these calculations were also performed poorly. These results suggest that ATC reports on the approach should be amended to specifically include the runway crosswind component and that all aircraft should have their crosswind limit clearly indicated in the cockpit.

In both cases, a very important question for designers of such displays is which elements of pictorial detail in the presented image are needed for satisfactory task or mission performance. Two elements of pictorial detail, a visible runway outline and ground texture, are considered in this article. An experiment is described in which the participants were required to initiate the landing maneuver during a simplified aircraft-landing task. This experiment was developed with 2 goals in mind: The first objective was to determine whether performance was influenced by the addition of ground texture; a second objective was to find out whether participants based their timing of the initiation of the landing maneuver on altitude perception or on the so-called time-to-contact (TTC; Lee, 1974). In the landing case, TTC is defined as the time remaining to the moment that the wheels make contact with the runway if no pilot action is taken. The results of the experiment show that landing performance is improved when ground texture is added to the display. The results also suggest that participants change their timing behavior from a strategy based on altitude perception when only a runway outline is present, to one based on TTC perception when texture is added to the display.</abstract>', '<title>Optic flow and visual analysis of the base-to-final turn</title> <abstract>In the spirit of other optic flow research, we address the problem of how a pilot turns an airplane into alignment with a runway, a maneuver that is one of the more challenging phases of visually controlled flight. In earlier work, Loomis and Beall (1992) proposed a rule for turning an aircraft into alignment: Turn the aircraft in such a way as to hold constant the rate of change of splay (the angle the projected runway makes with respect to the vertical). The experiment presented in this article was a psychophysical test of this rule. We compared day and night landing approaches as our experimental manipulation; we were interested in any role that ground texture might play in the spatial judgment involved in performing the landing approach. Three pilots varying in flight experience performed multiple approaches in a light aircraft for a total of 26 day and 25 night approaches. The three-dimensional trajectories of the aircraft were measured using differential global positioning system data. From these trajectories we computed a variety of motion variables (e.g., turn rate) and two optic flow variables (splay and splay rate). The similar performance of day and night approaches suggests that the pilots were using optic flow variables that were invariant with changes in the visibility of ground texture. A computer model was developed based on the optic flow rule and estimates of human visual processing thresholds. We conclude that the model gives a good description of pilot performance as tested in our experiment and may help to illuminate the cause of a class of airplane accidents during the common landing phase.</abstract>', '<title>Progress in the development of guidance strategies for the landing flare manoeuvre using tau-based parameters</title> <abstract>Purpose – To provide a progress report into research conducted to establish guidelines for the development of guidance vision aids. Design/methodology/approach – The first stage of the research is to establish a coherent engineering basis for the methods of (visual) motion perception and control to inform the design of pilot aids that will support flight in degraded visual conditions, particularly when close to the ground. The next stage will then be to construct and evaluate synthetic displays that recover the visual cues necessary to allow flight in degraded visual conditions for a range of manoeuvres using the flight simulation facilities at the University of Liverpool (UoL). The research is guided by tau (time to contact) theory from the field of ecological psychology. Findings – The closure of spatial gaps for a number of aircraft manoeuvres are presented in the tau domain. Analysis of the landing flare manoeuvre suggest that both a constant rate of change of tau strategy and an intrinsic tau-guidance strategy will yield benefits in terms of touchdown descent rate if presented as display symbology. Research limitations/implications – Results are presented from trials where only one professional pilot was used. Results from a wider population of pilots need to be analysed to ensure that the observed trends are generic. Practical implications – The reported results are being used in the next phase of the research project to inform the design of a guidance vision-aid for the flare manoeuvre. These displays will be tested in flight simulation trials. Originality/value – The research takes a theory of motion perception and applies it to aircraft guidance display technology. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited</abstract>']"

Many and exceedingly interesting results of the experiments, most of them obtained from numerous subjects, are cited, but they are too numerous and too well organized in the writers' summary to enumerate here. Two important results were the following: (1) Practically all of the best pursuit pilots belonged to the sensory reaction-time type, and exhibited a keen perception of the position of the body, low visual reaction-times, low choice reaction-times, and a low average deviation in reaction-time. Resistance to influences of emotional stimuli was not always present or necessary, some of the best pilots being quite susceptible to emotional conditions. (2) Practically all of the best slow machine, bombing, aviators were motors in reaction-time; and Caproni pilots exhibited resistance to emotional stimuli. From Psych Bulletin 18:06:00361.

Highlights of these programs are presented here, with special attention given to by far the largest, the Air Forces program. After World War Il, many of the hundreds of psychologist veterans became prominent research psychologists. Most became university professors. Among those who continued to work in applied settings was John Flanagan who had served as Chief of the Army Air Forces Psychology Branch. (After the war, Saul Sells succeeded Flanagan as Head of the Aviation Psychology program.) Flanagan founded the American Institutes for Research (AIR), the earliest mission of which was to select flight personnel for civilian airlines. Another part of the AIR mission was to enhance civilian air safety by assuring the widespread use of Flanagan's critical-incident procedures (or near-accident reports) that now serve to reduce accident rates in a variety of industries as well as in aviation.

Since the beginning of the space program, social and behavioral scientists have predicted that space crews increasingly will begin to experience the kinds of deviant behaviors seen in other extreme environmental duty settings as mission duration, crew size, and heterogeneity increases. However, there has been a long history of neglect by the nation\'s space agency of those psychosocial human factors which will play such a vital role in future manned spaceflight. The author argues that this is counterproductive, even dangerous, and that social and behavioral studies must be conducted to generate baseline data regarding dysfunctional acts in extreme environments, including the milieu of the space mission. An obstacle to studying occurrences and frequencies of deviant acts is the absence of a standardized definition of such acts in the extreme environment. Borrowing the sanitized NASA term ""off-nominal"", which generally refers to a maladaptive action, a preliminary reliability test was conducted among five scientists who work with human interaction in extreme environments. They were asked to rate situations from several actual space and polar expeditions for numbers of off-nominal acts. They were told the object of the exercise was to derive a standardized definition and were not provided with any specific definition of off-nominality. Substantial agreement in their ratings provided reliable information to construct a working definition of off-nominality. Various interactions and behaviors which respondents deemed off-nominal could be subsumed under poor expertise, mental disorder, forms of abuse and interpersonal insensitivity, problems of authority and responsibility, task deficits, poor hygiene and fitness, poor field-base communication, and human error with equipment from violating safety procedures and poor judgment as to its usage.</abstract>', '<title>Individual traits, personal values, and conflict resolution in an isolated, confined, extreme environment</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: The study of personality traits, personal values, and the emergence of conflicts within groups performing in an isolated, confined, and extreme environment (ICE) may provide insights helpful for the composition and support of space crews for long duration missions.

During the expedition individuals completed the isolated and confined environments Questionnaire and the Positive and Negative affect scale at 7-d intervals. subsequent semistructured interviews using a topic guide informed by Goffman’s “total institution” were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire and Portrait Values Questionnaire responses were similar between participants. the isolated and confined environments Questionnaire results showed significant variation with no clear trend. statistical significance was seen in social and emotional domains between sex and occupations. Positive and Negative affect scale scoring demonstrated higher positive affect (mean ± sD; 38.9 ± 1.5) to negative (13.1 ± 1.3). subgroup analysis demonstrated significance for negative affect between sexes (one result skewed the data). the interviews highlighted that individuals found the routine and lack of personal space challenging. interpersonal relationships were a source of support but also friction. DISCUSSION: Despite similar initial questionnaires and experiences during the expedition, subjects used a diverse range of coping strategies. interpersonal factors remain the most important aspect in ensuring a successful team and pre-expeditionary work should be carried out focusing on this.

Cabin air on commercial aircraft is sometimes contaminated with hydraulic fluids, synthetic jet engine oils and combusted or pyrolized materials.

In the UK, around 350 aircrew have advised their union that they may be suffering physical and psychological ill health following exposure to contaminated air. Design. This paper presents a case series of 27 pilots referred for psychological assessment. The general aim of the assessment was to determine whether pilots show evidence of cognitive impairment and whether this relates to exposure history. Materials and method. All pilots underwent neuropsychological and adult mental health assessment, undertaken by 12 examiners, instructed to search for alternative explanations other than exposure to toxic fumes for any symptoms reported. Results. Pilots reported alarming cognitive failures at work such as being unable to retain or confusing numerical information from Air Traffic Control. Nine pilots were excluded from further analysis because they had a medical or psychiatric condition which might otherwise explain these difficulties. In the remaining 18 pilots, language, perceptual skills and general intellectual ability were preserved, but performance on tests of psychomotor speed, attention and executive functioning was below expected levels. Conclusions. The cognitive deficits identified in this cohort of pilots cannot be attributed to factors such as mood disorder or malingering. However, the evidence available in this study does not enable firm conclusions to be drawn regarding a causal link with contaminated air; the cohort of pilots was self-selected and only crude indices of exposure were available. Further research is warranted given the scientific uncertainty regarding the health effects of inhalation of heated or pyrolized engine oil. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Musculoskeletal symptoms and psychosocial work environment, among Swedish commercial pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: The associations between psychosocial work conditions and health in pilots are understudied, and therefore, the associations between the psychosocial work conditions and musculoskeletal problems among Swedish commercial pilots were investigated.Methods: In 2010, a self-administered questionnaire study was performed among pilots in one Swedish commercial airline: 354 pilots participated (61\xa0%). Musculoskeletal symptoms and the psychosocial work conditions measured by the demand control social support model were investigated. Odds ratios (OR) with 95\xa0% confidence interval (95\xa0% CI) were expressed per change of one unit on the interquartile score scale.Results: Pilots on long-haul flights had less elbow symptoms (OR 0.34, 95\xa0% CI 0.14–0.85), and women had more hand symptoms (OR 2.90, 95\xa0% CI 1.11–7.52). There were associations between high work demands and symptoms from the neck (OR 2.04, 95\xa0% CI 1.45–2.88), shoulders (OR 1.46, 95\xa0% 1.05–2.03), elbows (OR 1.79, 95\xa0% CI 1.10–2.90) and low back (OR 1.42, 95\xa0% CI 1.02–1.96) in pilots. Low social support was associated with symptoms from the neck (OR 1.87, 95\xa0% 1.35–2.58), shoulders (OR 1.56, 95\xa0% CI 1.14–2.14) and low back (OR 1.63, 95\xa0% CI 1.18–2.24). Low supervisor support was associated with neck (OR 1.67, 95\xa0% CI 1.22–2.27), shoulders (OR 1.38, 95\xa0% CI 1.02–1.87) and low back symptoms (OR 1.48, 95\xa0% CI 1.09–2.01). The associations were mainly found among first officers.Conclusions: Musculoskeletal symptoms in pilots can be affected by poor psychosocial work conditions such as high demands and low social support, especially for first officers. The psychosocial aspects of organisational changes in commercial airlines should be taken into consideration. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</abstract>', ""<title>Self-assessed occupational health and working environment of female nurses, cabin crew and teachers</title> <abstract>Aim: The aim of this study was to describe and compare the self-assessed occupational health among female nurses, cabin crew and teachers, in relation to their working environment. Background: Similarities between the three occupations, i.e. predominantly female and service-oriented, render them interesting in comparison with respect to health and working environment. Methods: The participants were female Icelandic cabin crew, nurses and elementary school teachers. A questionnaire including items on socio-demographics, working environment (addressing work pace, job security, monotonous work, assistance, physically strenuous work and physical environmental factors) and a symptom list was used for data collection. Factor analyses on the symptom list resulted in five symptom scales: Musculoskeletal, Stress and exhaustion, Common cold, Gastrointestinal and Sound perception scale. A total of 1571 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 65.7-69%, depending on occupation. Data were collected in 2002. Results: Cabin crew reported worse gastrointestinal, sound perception and common cold symptoms than nurses and teachers. Cabin crew and teachers reported worse symptoms of stress and exhaustion than nurses (p < 0.05). When compared with teachers and nurses cabin crew reported less job security and more physically strenuous and monotonous work. Nurses were likelier to seek assistance from co-workers or patients as well as to take care of an older relative than teachers and cabin crew. Regression analysis found that within each occupation distress from environmental factors resulted in higher score on all the symptom scales. Conclusions: Nurses experience less stress and exhaustion than teachers and cabin crew. In comparison with one or both of the other occupations nurses are more likely to assist each other with their work, experience job security, reporting physically complex work and take care of older relatives. This should be highlighted as positive aspects of nurses' work praised as displaying responsibility and interconnectedness of nurses'. © 2007 The Authors.

A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors' diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39-53.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03-3.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09-12.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43-8.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27-7.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32-12.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43-19.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections. © 2016 Fu et al.

Methods: A standardized questionnaire (MM 040 NA) was mailed in February-March 1997 to all Stockholm aircrew on duty in a Scandinavian flight company (n = 1,857), and office workers from the same company (n = 218). During this time, smoking was allowed only on intercontinental flights. The participation rate was 81% (n = 1,513) of the aircrew, and 77% (n = 168) of the office group. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple logistic regression analysis, keeping age, gender, atopy, current smoking, occupation, and perceived psychosocial work conditions simultaneously in the model. Results: The most common symptoms among the aircrew were fatigue (21%), nasal symptoms (15%), ocular symptoms (11%), dry or flushed facial skin (12%), and dermal hand symptoms (12%). The aircrew had more nasal (odds ratio (OR) = 3.12), throat (OR = 5.75), and dermal symptoms on the face (OR = 2.03), and hands (OR = 3.68), than the office workers. The aircrew with a history of atopy had an increase of most symptoms (OR = 1.5-3.8), but age, gender, or smoking was not associated with symptoms. Perceived stress due to excess of work was associated with fatigue (OR = 7.33), feeling heavy-headed (OR = 9.52), headache (OR = 5.10), and facial dermal symptoms (OR = 3.75), while those crew with better work control and work satisfaction had less fatigue. For most symptoms, there were no differences between different categories onboard, but pilots had fewer ocular (OR = 0.28) nasal (OR = 0.52), and dermal hand symptoms (OR = 0.39). Airline crew that had been on an intercontinental flight the previous week had more complaints of fatigue (OR = 1.87), heavy-headedness (OR = 1.89), and difficulties concentrating (OR = 3.22). Conclusion: There was an association between symptoms and work stress, lack of influence on working conditions, atopy, and work on intercontinental flights where smoking was allowed. In view of the increase of civil aviation, the working conditions for aircrews need further attention. © Springer-Verlag 2002.</abstract>']"

The saccadic amplitude seems to reflect spatial and temporal values of target information. The dwelling time or gaze duration reflects the changing rate of visual information, amounts extracted from and density and complexity of the target information, or experience level of a relevant pilot. This study is for confirming the validity of the above indicator to discriminate the two types of flight tasks, instrument- and scenery-centered tasks. Five jet aircraft pilots, aged 25 to 32, participated in this experiment. A flight simulator equipped with a computer generated visual scene (field of view: 116 degree (H) x 25 degree (V)) was used. Five kinds of flight tasks were selected. These were takeoff, level flight, low-airspeed flight, acrobatic flight (minimum timed turn), and landing. These tasks were selected with the difference in degree of instrument- or scenery-centered flight, by the pilots' comments. Eye movements during simulator flight were recorded by a conventional electrooculographic apparatus with an 12-channel polygraph system. Analogue data from the amplifiers was digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz, and stored in a computer system. Horizontal components of eye movements by flight task were analyzed. Mean saccadic amplitudes (microV) showed significant differences among flight tasks, and no significance between subjects was obtained. The largest mean amplitude was in the acrobatic flight, and the smallest was in the low-airspeed flight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract>"", ""<title>Using eye-movement events to determine the mental workload of surgical residents</title> <abstract>These days, eye-tracking is one of the promising technologies used in different fields such as aviation, arts, sports, psychology and driving for several purposes. Even though it is being used for health purposes, studies involving eye-tracking are rare in the field of endo-neuro-surgery. This study aims to use this technology to promote our understanding of the effect related to computer-based instructional materials on mental workload of endo-neurosurgery residents. Four computer-based simulation scenarios are developed based on skill develop-ment requirements of endo-neurosurgery residents. Two of them were designed as general models and the other two as simulated surgical models. During these surgery procedures, in real settings, surgical residents need to use their both hands simultaneously to control the endoscope and the operational tool in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, to shed light on the participants' behaviors, these scenarios are performed with dominant-hand, non-dominant hand and, finally with both-hands using haptic interfaces. Twenty-three residents volun-teered in this study. Their eye-movements were recorded while performing the scenarios. According to the results of this study, when performing the simulated surgical models, an increase in the participants' mental workload was recorded when compared to the other scenarios. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the eye-movements of surgical residents can provide insights about the anticipated level of difficulty about the skill-based tasks. This information might be very critical to properly design and organize instructional materials for endo-neurosurgery, and also to better guide and evaluate the progress of trainees in com-puter simulation-based skill training environments. © 2018, International Group for Eye Movement Research.</abstract>"", '<title>Relationships Between Pilot Gaze Patterns and Control Lapses in Challenging Instrument Approach Flight</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates the link between pilot gaze patterns and control deviations during simulated instrument flight approaches, aiming to understand how attentional focus impacts flight safety. Background: Building on previous research that underscores the importance of situational awareness in aviation, this work delves into the specific aspects of gaze behavior as indicators of cognitive workload and attentional distribution. Unlike prior studies that broadly assessed attentional markers, this research utilizes advanced iris tracking technology to pinpoint how gaze metrics correlate with flight performance. Method: Employing a quantitative research design, the study analyzed over 45 simulated instrument flight approaches conducted by 15 pilots. Detailed metrics of gaze behavior, including fixation duration, saccade rate, scanning patterns, and gaze variability, were captured using iris tracking technology. A novel metric, exceedance autocorrelation, was introduced to assess aircraft control deviations and pilot performance. Results: Statistical analyses uncovered significant correlations: fixation duration exhibited a strong positive correlation with control quality (r = 0.684), and saccade rate correlated even more strongly (r = 0.827). Conversely, scan pattern predictability and gaze variability correlated negatively (r = −0.55) and positively (r = 0.546), respectively, highlighting their relevance under high cognitive workload conditions. Conclusion: The results confirms that specific gaze behaviors are critical indicators of pilot performance in challenging flight scenarios. These insights advance our understanding of pilot attentional mechanisms, offering valuable implications for enhancing aviation safety through improved training programs and cockpit technology design. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Comparison Between Scene-Independent and Scene-Dependent Eye Metrics in Assessing Psychomotor Skills</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aims to compare the relative sensitivity between scene-independent and scene-dependent eye metrics in assessing trainees' performance in simulated psychomotor tasks. Background: Eye metrics have been extensively studied for skill assessment and training in psychomotor tasks, including aviation, driving, and surgery. These metrics can be categorized as scene-independent or scene-dependent, based on whether predefined areas of interest are considered. There is a paucity of direct comparisons between these metric types, particularly in their ability to assess performance during early training. Method: Thirteen medical students practiced the peg transfer task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. Scene-independent and scene-dependent eye metrics, completion time, and tool motion metrics were derived from eye-tracking data and task videos. K-means clustering of nine eye metrics identified three groups of practice trials with similar gaze behaviors, corresponding to three performance levels verified by completion time and tool motion metrics. A random forest model using eye metrics estimated classification accuracy and determined the feature importance of the eye metrics. Results: Scene-dependent eye metrics demonstrated a clearer linear trend with performance levels than scene-independent metrics. The random forest model achieved 88.59% accuracy, identifying the top four predictors of performance as scene-dependent metrics, whereas the two least effective predictors were scene-independent metrics. Conclusion: Scene-dependent eye metrics are overall more sensitive than scene-independent ones for assessing trainee performance in simulated psychomotor tasks.

The objective of the current research was to examine military pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target. METHOD: In the current research, 37 mission-ready F-16 pilots participated. Subjects' eye movements were collected by a portable head-mounted eye-tracker during tactical training in a flight simulator. The scenarios of chasing a moving target (air-to-air) and a stationary target (air-to-surface) consist of three operational phases: searching, aiming, and lock-on to the targets. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated significant differences in pilots' percentage of fixation during the searching phase between air-to-air (M = 37.57, SD = 5.72) and air-to-surface (M = 33.54, SD = 4.68). Fixation duration can indicate pilots' sustained attention to the trajectory of a dynamic target during air combat maneuvers. Aiming at the stationary target resulted in larger pupil size (M = 27,105, SD = 6565), reflecting higher cognitive loading than aiming at the dynamic target (M = 23,864, SD = 8762). DISCUSSION: Pilots' visual behavior is not only closely related to attention distribution, but also significantly associated with task characteristics. Military pilots demonstrated various visual scan patterns for searching and aiming at different types of targets based on the research settings of a flight simulator. The findings will facilitate system designers' understanding of military pilots' cognitive processes during tactical operations. They will assist human-centered interface design to improve pilots' situational awareness. The application of an eye-tracking device integrated with a flight simulator is a feasible and cost-effective intervention to improve the efficiency and safety of tactical training. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>""]"

Presented is a naval flight officer whose personality traits were a threat to these key tenets and ultimately warranted removal from flight status. Case Report: A naval flight officer was twice referred to Human Factors Boards (HFBs) after concerns were raised about her emotional stability in and out of the cockpit. Her history revealed multiple clinical presentations revealing personality characteristics that should have raised immediate concern about her aeronautical adaptability. Formal psychiatric evaluation after her second HFB confirmed the presence of personality traits incompatible with aviation duty, but not until she had served nearly 4 yr as an aviation officer. Discussion: Aeronautical adaptability is a U.S. Naval term used to describe an individual\'s ability to work successfully in the aviation environment. Naval aviation personnel are considered not aeronautically adaptable/adapted if diagnosed with a ""personality disorder or prominent personality traits that adversely affect flight safety, mission completion, or crew coordination."" The Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army endorse similar concepts. Except for the U.S. Navy definition, aeronautical adaptability does not include formal DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, and, thus, flight surgeons and aviation medical examiners often make difficult aeromedical dispositions based on vague and subjective criteria. Conclusions: Determining aeronautical adaptability is not a simple, solitary process. It requires heightened suspicion, continual surveillance of suspect aviators, and collaboration from aviation medical professionals to ensure aviation safety.

General population norms provide an appropriate reference group when the distribution of scores in the sample can be expected to be similar to those for the general population (e.g., comparing high school students at a particular school to national high school norms on a college entrance test). Specialized norms are needed, however, when subsets of the population differ from the population at large. Military pilot trainees represent a special population; they are highly screened on cognitive ability and other characteristics thought to be related to job performance. Other characteristics (e.g., personality) are thought to be ""self-selected,"" resulting in distinctive profiles. Normative tables were developed for U.S. Air Force pilot trainees for two widely used tests, the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery-II (MAB-II) and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). METHODS: The MAB-II and NEO PI-R were administered to large samples of USAF cadets, ROTC students, and officers selected for pilot training. RESULTS: The mean MAB-II full-scale IQ was about 1.5 SD above the adult population norm and was much less variable, supporting the need for specialized norms. Tables showing the percentile equivalents are provided for use by clinicians. DISCUSSION: Use of these tables, in addition to, or in lieu of, commercially published norms, will prove helpful when clinical psychologists perform assessments on pilots; in particular when evaluating them for return-to-duty status following a disqualifying condition that may have affected cognitive functioning or emotional stability. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Relationship of personality factors and some social habits to cardiovascular risk in submariners</title> <abstract>Correlation and contingency analytical techniques were used to investigate the relationship between subtest scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in 1000 submariners. Groups of pesonality traits, both enhancing and protecting against risk of heart disease, were identified in these subjects. Personality trait patterns tending to be least associated with cardiovascular risk are tentatively identified by the three MMPI scales: psychasthenia, schizophrenia, and social introversion. On the other hand, the scales most strongly related to CHD risk in the submariner sample were denial of symptoms as measured by the K-scale, hypochondriasis, and hysteria. While the inherent inaccuracy in the prediction of CHD risk in young healthy individuals limits generalization from these findings, the potential utility of the MMPI to assist in risk detection is indicated. Comparisons of cigarette smoking, coffee drinking, and alcohol consumption with personality characteristics identified by the MMPI yielded trait clusters associated with each addictive habit. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption tended to correlate with traits positively associated with CHD risk. The correlations between those addictive habits and MMPI subtest scores were most significant for the F-scale, which measures inordinate tendencies to exaggerated emotional symptoms, and for the psychopathic deviate and hypomania scales. Significant negative correlations were found between the amount of coffee consumed and those personality traits negatively associated with CHD risk. These negative relationships were most significant for the MMPI scales schizophrenia and psychasthenia. Though the relationships were not necessarily construed to be causal, the contrasting modes through which these drug-associated habits appeared to relate to cardiovascular risk lend some support to the assumption that individuals with various specific sets of personality characteristics tend to incorporate these addictive behaviors into their behavior repertoire in very different ways.</abstract>', '<title>Personality traits in clinically referred aviators: Two clusters related to occupational suitability</title> <abstract>Background: The Five Factor Model (FFM) of normal personality provides a compelling framework for investigating personality subtypes in large military populations. The FFM was used to determine whether a sample of clinically referred military aviators exhibited commonly occurring personality clusters. Methods: The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was used to evaluate 956 clinically referred U.S. Naval aviators and flight officers on the domains of neuroticism (N), extroversion (E), openness (O), agreeableness (A), and conscientiousness (C). The scores were subjected to model-based cluster analysis and emergent clusters were compared with respect to their scores and clinical outcomes. Results: A two-cluster model provided the best fit to the data. MANOVA indicated significant differences between the two cluster groups with respect to four of the five factors (N, E, A, and C). The greatest differences were for N and E, with the smaller group (Group 1, N 5 291) being significantly more neurotic and less extroverted than Group 2 (N 5 665). Cluster membership had more specificity (0.74) than sensitivity (0.59) for predicting adverse clinical outcome, with the probability of an adverse clinical outcome increasing from 0.14 to 0.28 for those in the neurotic and introverted Group 1. Conclusions: Elevated neuroticism and depressed extraversion were the defining traits of the personality cluster less suited for aviation duty (Group 1). Results support assessment of neuroticism and extroversion during clinical mental health evaluations related to military aviation duty.© by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in cognitive function during and after lower body water immersion. Methods: On separate mornings, nine young healthy men participated in both neutral (35 ± 1°C) and cold (13 ± 1°C) water immersion. Subjects rested in neutral air for 30 min followed by 60 min water immersion to the iliac crest and 15 min of recovery in neutral air. Rectal temperature and mean skin temperature were continuously monitored. Metabolic rate, the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) were quantified at predetermined intervals. Results: During immersion in cold water, rectal temperature was reduced, but SCWT and POMS scores were unchanged relative to baseline. Despite the reduced rectal temperature, little to no shivering was observed during immersion and metabolic rate did not change. During recovery from cold immersion, rectal temperature was further reduced by; 0.5°C, shivering was noted, and metabolic rate increased. Coincident with this acute afterdrop, SCWT Color-Word performance (Δ = 2 4 ± 8 vs. 7 ± 6 correct responses) and Interference score (Δ = 2 2 ± 7 vs. 4 ± 8) was impaired relative to recovery from neutral immersion (i.e., when core temperature and metabolic rate did not change).

Habituation to cold-water immersion (CWI) is one practical means of reducing the cold shock response (CSR) on immersion. We investigated whether repeated thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) induced a perceptual habituation (i.e., could lessen perceived threat and anxiety) and consequently reduce the CSR on subsequent CWI. Methods: There were 12 subjects who completed seven 7-min head-out immersions. Immersions one and seven were CWIs [15.0 (0.1)°C], and immersions two to six were TWI [34.9 (0.10)°C]. Anxiety (20-cm visual analogue scale) and the cardiorespiratory responses [heart rate (f <inf>c</inf> ), respiratory frequency (f <inf>R</inf> ), tidal volume (V <inf>T</inf> ), and minute ventilation ( V <inf>E</inf> )] to immersion were measured throughout. Data were compared within subject between conditions using ANOVA to an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Acute anxiety was signifi cantly reduced after repeated exposure to the immersion scenario (i.e., TWI): CWI-1: 6.3 (4.4) cm; and CWI-2: 4.5 (4.0) cm [condition mean (SD)]. These differences did not infl uence the peak in the CSR. The f <inf>c</inf> , f <inf>R</inf> , and .V E responses were similar between CWI-1 and CWI-2. V <inf>T</inf> response was signifi cantly lower in CWI- 2; mean (SD) across the immersion: CWI-1 1.27 (0.17) vs. CWI-2 1.11 (0.2) L. Discussion: Repeated TWI lessened the anxiety associated with CWI (perceptual habituation). This had a negligible effect on the primary components of the CSR, but did lower V <inf>T</inf> , which may reduce the volume of any aspirated water in an emergency situation.

Heat stress can influence human cognitive activity, which might be critical in the flying situation, requiring efficient and error-free performance. This study investigated the effect of wearing protective clothing under various ambient conditions on physiological and cognitive performance. On several occasions, eight subjects were exposed for 3 h to three different environmental conditions; 0°C at 80% RH, 23°C at 63% RH and 40°C at 19% RH. The subjects were equipped with thermistors, dressed as they normally do for flights (including helmet, two layers of underwear and an uninsulated survival suit). During three separate exposures the subjects carried out two cognitive performance tests (Vigilance test and DG test). Performance was scored as correct, incorrect, missed reaction and reaction time. Skin temperature, deep body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, temperature and humidity inside the clothing, sweat loss, subjective sensation of temperature and thermal comfort were measured. Rises in rectal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate and body water loss indicated a high level of heat stress in the 40°C ambient temperature condition in comparison with 0°C and 23°C. Performance of the DG test was unaffected by ambient temperature. However, the number of incorrect reactions in the Vigilance test was significantly higher at 40°C than at 23°C (p = 0.006) or 0°C (p = 0.03). The effect on Vigilance performance correlated with changes in deep-body temperature, and this is in accordance with earlier studies that have demonstrated that cognitive performance is virtually unaffected unless environmental conditions are sufficient to change deep body temperature.</abstract>', ""<title>Thermal balance effects on vigilance during 2-hour exposures to -20°C</title> <abstract>Introduction: Human mental performance is markedly affected by environmental temperature, body temperature, body heat content, and comfort, but the effects of these different factors are not entirely clear.

We hypothesized that cold exposure (coldEX) has negative effects on vigilance which can be alleviated by increasing body heat content throughout or prior to coldEX. Methods: Subjects (n = 10) were tested for vigilance during a 130-min coldEX to -20°C while warmly clothed; a period of moderate exercise occurred at minutes 64-74. An LCG was used to provide heating either before coldEX (prior heating, PH) or throughout coldEX (heating, H); the control condition involved no heating (NH). Results: There were significant differences among conditions for rectal temperature (PH: 37.3 ± 0.26°C, H: 37.0 ± 0.24°C, NH: 37.05 ± 0.26°C) and mean skin temperature (PH: 33.85 ± 1.21°C, H: 35.11 ± 1.35°C, NH: 32.84 ± 0.65°C). Reaction time decreased significantly after the 45th minute of coldEX in H and NH. At the same time, signal detection criteria in all conditions demonstrated considerable alterations, indicating bias in favor of 'target-present' responses, which were associated with lower mean skin temperature and thermal comfort vote. PH was more effective than H and NH in preserving reaction time and response consistency. Relative to men, women demonstrated increased heat loss and more deteriorated vigilance and signal detection. Conclusion: Vigilance deteriorates in cold conditions within 45 min of exposure. Increasing body heat content prior to coldEX is efficacious in preserving vigilance performance during exposures lasting up to 2 h.

Methods: Eight males exercised while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in a warm, dry environment (dry bulb temperature: 30°C; dew-point temperature: 11°C) in each of the tests. Treadmill exercise was performed (∼225 W·m-2) for 80 min. A liquid cooling garment (LCG) covered 72% of the body surface area. Core temperature (Tc), local skin temperatures, heart rate, inlet and outlet LCG perfusate temperatures, flow, and electrical power to the LCG and metabolic rate were measured during exercise. Results: At 75 min of exercise T̄sk was higher (33.9 ± 0.2°C) in PCskin, than in PC (33.1 ± 0.5°C) or CC (32.0 ± 0.6°C) and PC > CC. The changes in Tc and heart rate during the tests were not different. Tc at 75 min was not different among the cooling paradigms (37.6 ± 0.3°C in PCskin, 37.6 ± 0.2°C in PC and 37.6 ± 0.2°C in CC). Heart rate averaged 124 ± 10 bpm in PCskin, 120 ± 9 bpm in PC and 117 ± 9 bpm in CC. Total body insulation (°C·W-1·m-2) was significantly reduced in PCskin (0.020 ± 0.003) and PC (0.024 ± 0.004) from CC (0.029 ± 0.004). Electrical power in PCskin was reduced by 46% from CC and by 28% from PC. Discussion/Conclusion: Real-time T̄sk feedback to control cooling optimized LCG efficacy and reduced electrical power for cooling without significantly changing cardiovascular strain in exercising men wearing PPE.

Questions addressed include whether personality predicted final selection into the astronaut corps, whether women and men demonstrated typical gender differences in personality, and whether three characteristic clusters found in other high performance populations replicated in this group. Methods: Between 1989 and 1995, 259 final stage astronauts completed the Personal Characteristic Inventory (PCI) which assesses personality characteristics related to the broad traits of Instrumentality and Expressivity. In addition, 147 of these individuals also completed an abbreviated version of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) which assesses the ""Big Five"" traits of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, And Conscientiousness. Results: Three previously identified trait clusters (Right, Wrong, and No Stuff) were found to replicate in this population. No differences were found on the PCI or on the modified NEO-FFI between applicants who were chosen to become astronauts (n = 63) and those who were not (n = 196). Men scored higher than women on competitiveness, but lower on expressivity and achievement strivings. Discussion: These analyses suggest that the ""Right Stuff,"" ""Wrong Stuff"" and ""No Stuff"" clusters originally described in airline pilots and other high performance groups also exist within this population. Consistent with findings from other high performance populations, men and women tend to differ to a lesser extent than found in the general population, particularly on traits related to achievement motivation.

The first comparison group, recruited from Johnson Space Center, was similar in age, education, and general health to the astronaut candidate group; the second comparison group included university undergraduate students. METHODS: This study employed two different tasks—a simple perceptual-motor task involving data entry and a complex memory updating task requiring both prospective and retrospective memory. Subjects completed multiple sessions involving both tasks over a 500-d period, with test sessions involving transfer and/or a cognitive load manipulation. For the perceptual-motor task, transfer involved changes to the stimuli that increased intrinsic cognitive load or changes to the required motoric procedures. For the memory updating task, extraneous cognitive load was increased by the addition of a concurrent secondary task. RESULTS: For both the perceptual-motor and memory updating tasks, astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects performed more accurately, with greater speed, and were less impacted by increased cognitive load than undergraduate students. Despite the generally superior performance of astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects, they were more likely to experience negative transfer on the perceptual-motor task, whereas undergraduate students demonstrated positive transfer. DISCUSSION: Candidate-like subjects provided a more accurate approximation of astronaut candidate performance than did undergraduate students, especially with regard to negative transfer effects and cognitive load. © copyright by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Personality Traits That Distinguish Special Operations Female Aircrew</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) female aircrew represent a small group of military personnel in challenging high-risk, high-demand professions. Personality characteristics may play a key role in distinguishing those women who pursue a career as a special operations aircrew member and succeed in this pursuit. Having access to normative personality data can potentially support psychologists in assessing AFSOC female aircrew and subsequently making informed recommendations to leadership. METHODS: A total of 586 AFSOC aircrew trainees—58 (9.9%) women and 528 (90.1%) men—completed a series of computer-based psychological tests to assess cognitive ability and personality traits. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences between female AFSOC aircrew and female civilians on four of the five NEO Personality Inventory domains: Neuroticism (M 5 74.9 vs. M 5 87.1), Extraversion (M 5 123.7 vs. M 5 112.8), Openness to Experience (M 5 122.6 vs. M 5 111.0), and Conscientiousness (M 5 136.0 vs. M 5 120.6), respectively. The comparison between female AFSOC aircrew and male AFSOC aircrew revealed significant differences across three of the five domains: Neuroticism (M 5 74.9 vs. M 5 65.1), Openness to Experience (M 5 122.6 vs. M 5 115.0), and Agreeableness (M 5 119.6 vs. M 5 112.7), respectively. DISCUSSION: Implications for assessment and interpretation of psychological testing are discussed. This paper provides a unique perspective and insight into those who pursue and excel in this career field. Identifying specific personality traits in our AFSOC female aircrew allows for tailored care and support when evaluating readiness in special operations aircrew for optimizing performance. © © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA</abstract>', '<title>Association of individual characteristics with teleoperation performance</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: A number of space activities (e.g., extravehicular astronaut rescue, cooperation in satellite services, space station supplies, and assembly) are implemented directly or assisted by remote robotic arms. Our study aimed to reveal those individual characteristics which could positively influence or even predict teleoperation performance of such a space robotic arm. METHODS: There were 64 male volunteers without robot operation experience recruited for the study. Their individual characteristics were assessed, including spatial cognitive ability, cognitive style, and personality traits. The experimental tasks were three abstracted teleoperation tasks of a simulated space robotic arm: point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance. Teleoperation performance was measured from two aspects: task performance (completion time, extra distance moved, operation slips) and safety performance (collisions, joint limitations reached). The Pearson coefficients between individual characteristics and teleoperation performance were examined along with performance prediction models. RESULTS: It was found that the subjects with relatively high mental rotation ability or low neuroticism had both better task and safety performance (|r|=0.212~0.381). Subjects with relatively high perspective taking ability or high agreeableness had better task performance (r=20.253; r=20.249). Imagery subjects performed better than verbal subjects regarding both task and safety performance (|r|=0.236~0.290). Compared with analytic subjects, wholist subjects had better safety performance (r=0.300). Additionally, extraverted subjects had better task performance (r=20.259), but worse safety performance (r=0.230). CONCLUSIONS: Those with high spatial cognitive ability, imagery and wholist cognitive style, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness were seen to have more advantages in working with the remote robotic arm. These results could be helpful to astronaut selection and training for space station missions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

Human Centrifuge Systems (HCSs) provide an effective G-acceleration training tool to prepare and increase the G-tolerance of aircrew. Though highly capable HCSs are available, they are yet to be fully optimised to accurately and reliably recreate the G-vectors produced by ACMs. Optimisation steps to achieve this improvement involve the configurational structure, motion capability, and motion control of HCSs. To improve the motion capability and control of HCSs, the relationship between aircraft G-vectors and HCS G-vectors should be profoundly investigated. This work analyses the G-vectors of common ACMs and the corresponding G-vectors as well as kinematics of an active four Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) HCS. The mathematical models of an aircraft and HCS kinematics are developed using rigid body equations of motion through Newton-Euler method. The relationship between aircraft G-vectors and HCS G-vectors is established using inverse kinematics with an optimal solver. The outcomes of this study show that an active four-DoF HCS with gondola roll, pitch, and yaw rotation can replicate the G-vectors of common ACMs with small discrepancies. The largest error between the reference and achieved G-vectors occurred along the local z-axis of the HCS gondola during the transition of roll, pitch, and yaw motions of the gondola to the required angle replicating the G-vectors of the ACMs. The tracing errors are not significant; hence they can be mitigated with an optimal control technique. The presented outcomes will provide an essential step in identifying the optimal design and refined requirements for an HCS to efficiently replicate aircraft G-vectors. The applied methodology is easily adaptable to HCS with different structures and DoFs. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract>', '<title>Subject anxiety and psychological considerations for centrifuge-simulated suborbital spaceflight</title> <abstract>Introduction: Anxiety and psychological concerns may pose a challenge to future commercial spaceflight. To help identify potential measures of anxiousness and indicators of flight-related stress, the psychiatric histories and anxiousness responses of volunteers exposed to G forces in centrifuge-simulated spaceflight acceleration profiles were examined. Methods: Over 2 d, 86 individuals (63 men, 23 women), 20-78 yr old, underwent up to 7 centrifuge runs. Day 1 consisted of two +G<inf>z</inf> runs (peak = +3.5 G<inf>z</inf>) and two +G<inf>x</inf> runs (peak = +6.0 G<inf>x</inf>). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G<inf>x</inf> and +G<inf>z</inf>). Hemodynamic data were collected during the profiles. Subjects completed a retrospective self-report anxiety questionnaire. Medical monitors identified individuals exhibiting varying degrees of anxiousness during centrifuge exposure, medical histories of psychiatric disease, and other potential indicators of psychological intolerance of spaceflight. Results: The retrospective survey identified 18 individuals self-reporting anxiousness, commonly related to unfamiliarity with centrifuge acceleration and concerns regarding medical history. There were 12 individuals (5 men, 7 women, average age 46.2 yr) who were observed to have anxiety that interfered with their ability to complete training; of these, 4 reported anxiousness on their questionnaire and 9 ultimately completed the centrifuge profiles. Psychiatric history was not significantly associated with anxious symptoms. Discussion: Anxiety is likely to be a relevant and potentially disabling problem for commercial spaceflight participants; however, positive psychiatric history and self-reported symptoms did not predict anxiety during centrifuge performance. Symptoms of anxiousness can often be ameliorated through training and coaching. Even highly anxious individuals are likely capable of tolerating commercial spaceflight. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>The effects of training on anxiety and task performance in simulated suborbital spaceflight</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: In commercial spaceflight, anxiety could become mission-impacting, causing negative experiences or endangering the flight itself. We studied layperson response to four varied-length training programs (ranging from 1 h-2 d of preparation) prior to centrifuge simulation of launch and re-entry acceleration profiles expected during suborbital spaceflight. We examined subject task execution, evaluating performance in high-stress conditions. We sought to identify any trends in demographics, hemodynamics, or similar factors in subjects with the highest anxiety or poorest tolerance of the experience. METHODS: Volunteers participated in one of four centrifuge training programs of varied complexity and duration, culminating in two simulated suborbital spaceflights. At most, subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d, including two +G<inf>z</inf> runs (peak +3.5 G<inf>z</inf>, Run 2) and two +G<inf>x</inf> runs (peak +6.0 G<inf>x</inf>, Run 4) followed by three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G<inf>x</inf> and +G<inf>z</inf>, peak +6.0 G<inf>x</inf> and +4.0 G<inf>z</inf>). Two cohorts also received dedicated anxietymitigation training. Subjects were evaluated on their performance on various tasks, including a simulated emergency. RESULTS: Participating in 2-7 centrifuge exposures were 148 subjects (105 men, 43 women, age range 19-72 yr, mean 39.4 ± 13.2 yr, body mass index range 17.3-38.1, mean 25.1 ± 3.7). There were 10 subjects who withdrew or limited their G exposure; history of motion sickness was associated with opting out. Shorter length training programs were associated with elevated hemodynamic responses. Single-directional G training did not significantly improve tolerance. DISCUSSION: Training programs appear best when high fidelity and sequential exposures may improve tolerance of physical/ psychological flight stressors. The studied variables did not predict anxiety-related responses to these centrifuge profiles. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Optimizing Muscle Activation in Cadets Using Electromyography Biofeedback During Anti-G Training</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Effective execution of the anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) is essential for pilots to maintain consciousness under high gravitational forces (+Gz). This study evaluated whether electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback enhances muscle activation patterns during AGSM training in novice cadets. METHODS: There were 58 Brazilian Air Force cadets (age: 25\u202f±\u202f1 yr) who performed two AGSM sessions involving sustained submaximal isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, and rectus abdominis muscles, synchronized with rhythmic breathing every 3 s. Subjects completed trials under counterbalanced visual EMG feedback conditions (real-time visualization vs. no visualization) and were randomly assigned to verbal feedback conditions (instructor guidance vs. no guidance). EMG signals were recorded at 1500\u202fHz and normalized to each subject's peak amplitude during the AGSM trials. RESULTS: Muscle-specific responses to feedback were observed. Verbal feedback enhanced gastrocnemius activation but reduced vastus medialis activation. Combined visual and verbal feedback produced the highest activation in the rectus abdominis. Visual feedback alone had minimal effect across all muscles. Despite submaximal instructions, brief peak activations were sufficient for normalization. DISCUSSION: EMG biofeedback facilitated motor learning of AGSM by selectively improving activation in targeted muscles. However, effects varied by muscle group, suggesting the need for tailored instructional strategies. Although task-based normalization offers ecological validity, it may limit comparisons with MVC-based protocols. Incorporating EMG biofeedback may enhance AGSM training, particularly in novice populations or settings without centrifuge access. Massaferri R, Calvo APC, Coutinho ABB, Guimarães TT, Farinatti P.

High speeds that modern aircraft develop during take-off, flight and landing place an additional strain on the organ of vision. Owing to its considerable practical implementation in air combat, the effect of +Gz acceleration on the organ of vision is considered increasingly important for research. Substantial changes in visual functions may occur during high acceleration onset rates. However, it is important for a pilot to maintain visual acuity in order to be able to monitor new functional displays for rapid orientation, scan the configuration of terrain, display of weapons systems and enemy aircraft and deal with additional issues of the complexity of spatial orientation. The aim of the investigation was to establish whether distance visual acuity in air force pilots and student pilots is affected when exposed to +Gz acceleration. Methods. The study was performed on a defined population consisting of 95 respondents from 21 to 45 years of age divided into two groups. The first group included 65 air force pilots and the second group comprised of 30 student pilots, all of whom were exposed to an acceleration of +5.5 Gz. The testing was performed in a human centrifuge, which mimics conditions of real Gz acceleration, in the Department of Biodynamics in Aero Medical Institute (Zemun, Serbia). We examined the obtained differences in distance visual acuity before and after exposure to acceleration. Results. After the testing, all respondents in the group of air force pilots had distance visual acuity of 1.0, while in the group of student pilots a statistically significant difference in distance visual acuity was observed after being exposed to +Gz acceleration. Conclusion. Transient changes in distant visual acuity were more pronounced in the group of student pilots in comparison with the changes in visual acuity in the air force pilots when exposed to the same acceleration values (+5Gz acceleration). Since change in distance visual acuity is the most sensitive physiological indicator when exposed to high acceleration, individual physiological pilot training in the human centrifuge increases tolerance to accelerations, which is important for flight safety in both peacetime and combat conditions. © 2022 Inst.

Background: The FAS measures the anxiety levels in different flight situations, while FAM assesses the somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety or anticipatory anxiety in different flight situations. The FAS and the FAM have been adapted to different cultures and used in different studies. Method: 645 adults from different regions of Turkey participated in this study (M<inf>age</inf> = 25.58, SD<inf>age</inf> = 10.43, 59.2% women). A Socio-demographic Information Form, the Visual Analog Flight Anxiety Scale (VAFAS), the FAS, the FAM and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used for data collection. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed that the Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM had similar factor structures to the original forms. The FAS consisted of three factors and the FAM consisted of two factors with factor loadings between.56 and.85. High Cronbach’s alpha scores (.78–.97) of the FAS, the FAM and their subscales supported internal consistency reliability. Convergent and discriminant validity of the scales were supported with correlation analysis and independent samples t-test. Conclusion: The Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM provided psychometrically sound self-report measures of flight anxiety.

External factors like cabin design and environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure, noise, and vibration) interact with individual characteristics (anxiety traits, fear of fl ying, and personality) from arrival at the airport to landing at the destination. In this study, we investigated the infl uence of space and motion discomfort (SMD), fear of heights, and anxiety on comfort perception during all phases of air travel. Methods: We evaluated 51 frequent air travelers through a modifi ed version of the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (FAS), in which new items were added and where the subjects were asked to report their level of discomfort or anxiety (not fear) for each phase of air travel (Chronbach ' s alpha 5 0.974). Correlations were investigated among these scales: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Cohen ' s Acrophobia Questionnaire, and the Situational Characteristics Questionnaire (SitQ, designed to estimate SMD levels). Results: Scores of SitQ correlated with discomfort in situations involving space and movement perception (Pearson ' s rho 5 0.311), while discomfort was associated with cognitive mechanisms related to scores in the anxiety scales (Pearson ' s rho 5 0.375). Anxiety traits were important determinants of comfort perception before and after fl ight, while the infl uence of SMD was more signifi cant during the time spent in the aircraft cabin.

It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is stimulated through elevated noradrenaline levels. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the potential exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in a clinical sample of participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for a specific phobia (fear of flying). Methods: Sixty-seven participants with fear of flying were randomized to 4 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) combined with YOH (10 mg), or 4 sessions of VRET combined with a placebo. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour exposure sessions consisting of two 25-minute virtual flights. At pre-and post-treatment, fear of flying was assessed. The YOH or placebo capsules were administered 1 h prior to exposures. The manipulation of the noradrenaline activity was confirmed by salivary α-amylase (sAA) samples taken pre-, during and post-exposure. Results: Forty-eight participants completed treatment. Manipulation of noradrenaline levels with YOH was successful, with significantly higher levels of sAA in the YOH group when entering exposure. Results showed that both groups improved significantly from pre-to post-treatment with respect to anxiety reduction. However, although the manipulation of noradrenaline activity was successful, there was no evidence that YOH enhanced outcome. Conclusions: Participants improved significantly on anxiety measures independently of drug condition, after 4 sessions of VRET. These data do not support the initial findings of exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in this dosage in clinical populations. © 2011 S.

We evaluated FoF treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements simulating, e.g., takeoff, landing, and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli were also incorporated. Case Report: Three male patients with FoF underwent a clinical interview followed by three VRETs in the presence and with the guidance of a therapist. Scores on the Flight Anxiety Situation (FAS) and Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires were obtained on the first and fourth visits. Anxiety levels were assessed using the subjective units of distress (SUDs) scale during the exposure. All three subjects expressed satisfaction regarding the procedure and did not skip or avoid any of its stages. Consistent improvement was seen in the SUDs throughout the VRET session and across sessions, while patients ' scores on the FAS and FAM showed inconsistent trends. Two patients participated in actual flights in the months following the treatment, bringing 12 and 16 yr of avoidance to an end. Discussion: This VR-based treatment includes critical elements for exposure of flying experience beyond visual and auditory stimuli.

Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of nurses and air ambulance service providers regarding aeromedical evacuations. Methods: This study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Data were gathered from February to July 2023 through semi-structured online interviews with seven nurses and air ambulance service providers engaged in aeromedical evacuation.

The noise featured a Dopplerlike quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d‘) was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a “floor effect” rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload. The results provide the initial experimental demonstration that perceived workload is a sensitive measure of the effects of aircraft noise in monitoring tasks. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Aircraft interior noise is important, especially in long-term flights, concerning the health, comfort, and psychological wellness of both passengers and flight crew. Noise levels, which changes according to different motions of aircraft, can be defined as the noise during takeoff and landing and during level flight (cruise). There are also non-aircraft-originating noise sources in the cabin. These can be classified into those caused by passenger activities such as conversations and luggage-related rearrangements as well as those caused by flight-crew such as flight attendant-related speaking activities, announcements from pilot and flight attendants, mechanical noises during food/beverage services and flight security demonstrations, and other announcement signals. In this study, in-cabin noise levels were measured during all flight activities in a commercial jet passenger plane. These noise levels consist of both continuous and discontinuous types. As a general tendency, continuous noise levels were seen to be 60-65 dB(A) prior to takeoff, and 80-85 dB(A) and 75-80 dB(A) during flight and landing, respectively. Discontinuous in-cabin noise levels were observed to reach levels as high as 81-88 dB(A) range. This study shows that it can be possible to control and reduce in-cabin noise levels, especially due to human activities and a few recommendations are suggested.</abstract>', '<title>Nocturnal aircraft noise effects</title> <abstract>Noise protection associated with the construction and extension of airports in the Federal Republic of Germany has been regulated by the law for protection against aircraft noise since 1971. This legislation is due for revision because of different aspects. One aspect is the growth of air traffic which has led many airports to the limits of their capacity and in search of new ways of adaptation to the increasing demand for flight services. Another aspect is the increasing concern of the population about noise effects which has to be addressed by better protection against the effects of aircraft noise. The framework conditions of policy in terms of society as a whole, its health and economic environment need to be put into effect by political action. Science can contribute to this goal by performing noise effects research and by providing recommendations to the political body. However, it remains controversial, what measures are necessary or adequate to assure effective protection of the population against aircraft noise. This is particularly true for the protection of rest and sleep at night. The problem of finding a common basis for adequate recommendations is associated with (1) the low number of primary studies, which also exhibited highly variable results and assessments, (2) the handling of acoustic or psycho-acoustic dimensions for quantifying psychological or physiological reactions, and (3) the conception of how far preventive measures have to go to prove effective. With this in mind, the DLR Institute for Aerospace Medicine is conducting a large-scale, multi-stage study for investigating the acute effects of nocturnal aircraft noise on human sleep. This enterprise is implemented in the framework of the HGF/DLR project ""Quiet Air Traffic"" for developing sustainable assessment criteria for human-specific effects of aircraft noise at night.</abstract>', '<title>Noise Exposure of Fighter Pilots and Ground Technicians during Flight Rounds</title> <abstract>The noise inside the cockpit and on the platform is high during the operation of a jet fighter. Although short-term noise measurements have been done for almost all fighters, platforms and airports, there is little information on the long-term exposure of pilots and technicians. Noise was measured in the following types of Finnish fighters: Hornet F-18, Saab 35 Draken, Mig 21 Bis, jet trainer BA Hawk MK-51 and basic trainers. The pilots used Gentex helmets in the F-18, a FFV Flyghjälm helmet in the Draken, a ZSH-5A helmet in the Mig and an Alpha helmet in the Hawk, Vinka and Redigo. The noise exposures were evaluated by noise dose meters and tape-recording systems outside and inside the flight helmet. The averaged values for the pilots varied over the flight in the cockpit from 96 to 100 dB and in the ear canal from 88 to 95 dB The highest values were measured in Mig 21 Bis fighters. The analyses indicated that radio noise, as measured equivalent noise, is 4-10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. According to the audiometric data of this study a pilot with an average of 600 hours of flying time should not be at risk of hearing loss. However, noise can still influence flight safety parameters and other physiological or psychological effects. Over a day, the technicians received surprisingly similar noise exposures, varying from 93 to 97 dB. The start values were highest (108 dB L<inf>Aeq15min</inf>) for F-18 and Hawk planes, which use an auxiliary starting motor. If the earmuffs in use were able to reduce the fighter noise by 30 dB, the daily exposure of technicians would vary from 63 to 67 dB, and, if the A-weighted instantaneous sound pressure levels vary from 110 to 120dB on the platform, then the maximum noise levels entering the ear canal would be 80-90dB.</abstract>', ""<title>Seat vibration in military propeller aircraft: Characterization, exposure assessment, and mitigation</title> <abstract>Introduction: There have been increasing reports of annoyance, fatigue, and even neck and back pain during prolonged operation of military propeller aircraft, where persistent multi-axis vibration occurs at higher frequencies beyond human whole-body resonance. This paper characterizes and assesses the higher frequency vibration transmitted to the occupants onboard these aircraft. Methods: Multi-axis accelerations were measured at the occupied seating surfaces onboard the WC/C-130J, C-130H3, and E-2C Hawkeye. The effects of the vibration were assessed in accordance with current international guidelines (ISO 2631-1:1997). The relative psychophysical effects of the frequency components and the effects of selected mitigation strategies were also investigated. Results: The accelerations associated with the blade passage frequency measured on the passenger seat pans located on the side of the fuselage near the propeller plane of the C-130J (102 Hz) and C-130H3 (68 Hz) were noteworthy (5.19 ± 1.72 ms-2 rms and 7.65 ± 0.71 ms-2 rms, respectively, in the lateral direction of the aircraft). The psychophysical results indicated that the higher frequency component would dominate the side passengers' perception of the vibration. Balancing the props significantly reduced the lower frequency propeller rotation vibration (17 Hz), but had little effect on the blade passage frequency vibration. Conclusions: The relationships among the frequency, vibration direction, and seat measurement sites were complex, challenging the development of seating systems and mitigation strategies. Psychophysical metrics could provide a tool for optimizing mitigation strategies, but the current international vibration standard may not provide optimum assessment methods for evaluating higher frequency operational exposures.

Considering recent operating experience as a group-level input factor, aspects of the communication process between crewmembers (Captain and First Officer), were explored as a possible mediator to performance. Communication patterns were defined by a speech act typology adapted for the flightdeck setting and distinguished crews that had previously flown together (FT) from those that had not flown together (NFT). A more open communication channel with respect to information exchange and validation and greater First Officer participation in task-related topics was shown by FT crews while NFT crews engaged in more non-task discourse, a speech mode less structured by roles and probably serving a more interpersonal function. Relationships between the speech categories themselves, representing linguistic, and role-related interdependencies provide guidelines for interpreting the primary findings.</abstract>', '<title>Barriers to Intra-Aircraft Communication and Safety: The Perspective of the Flight Attendants</title> <abstract>Failures of communication and teamwork between cabin crew and flight deck crew have been implicated in a number of fatal accidents involving commercial aircraft. This study was designed to identify perceived barriers to effective teamwork and communication between pilots and flight attendants in airline operations. The nominal group technique (NGT) was used to gather data from 18 flight attendant focus groups involving 100 flight attendants operating on both narrow-bodied and wide-bodied jet aircraft from a major air carrier. The NGT focus group methodology generated both barriers and solutions to communication from the flight attendant perspective in the following key areas: the locked flight deck door and interphone protocols; ""sterile cockpit"" standard operating procedures (SOPs); preflight briefings; knowledge of basic aircraft terminology; debriefings after incidents; and contractual differences in hotels, meals, and allowances. An emphasis on joint crew resource management (CRM) training between pilots and flight attendants provides the most appropriate way to address these perceived barriers.

The flight scenario was designed to be as realistic as possible but consisted of a task which included abnormal operations and required the coordinated efforts of all crew members. It was found that the best performing crews were characterized by nearly identical patterns of communication, whereas the midrange and poorer performing crews showed a great deal of heterogeneity in their speech patterns. Although some specific speech sequences can be interpreted as being more or less facilitative to the crew coordination process, predictability appears to be the key ingredient for enhancing crew performance. Crews communicating in highly standard, hence predictable, ways were better able to coordinate their task, whereas crews characterized by multiple, nonstandard communication profiles were less effective in their performance. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Specific speech patterns characterized each crew, but the overriding findings included: a) marked homogeneity of patterns characterizing low-error crews, interpreted as the adoption of a standard form of communicating, and b) heterogeneity of patterns characterizing high-error crews, interpreted as the relative absence of a conventionalized form. Because conventions are regularities which confirm the expectations of those involved, predictability of crewmember behavior should be greater when standard conventions are followed.

Participants were given audio and visual side tasks and responded to alerts in different aircraft attitudes. Shorter reaction times were observed when a HF visual alert was given in addition to the standard audio alert. No significant differences in recovery performance (measured by response time and altitude loss) were observed between display formats.

Of interest was whether the effects found in earlier studies, favoring the moving-aircraft format, could be replicated with most recent technology including extended horizon displays, which depict the artificial horizon extended over the whole screen with overlaying speed and altitude scales (e.g., B787). Background: Although the moving-horizon format represents the standard approach in Western aviation, human factors research from the 1950s to the 1970s with round electromechanical instruments favored the moving-aircraft format with respect to better support of flight-path tracking and unusual attitude recoveries. However, recent studies using laboratory displays more similar to modern primary flight displays provided inconsistent results. This led to the assumption that the display’s design is a moderating factor of those effects. Method: Thirty-two novices and 13 pilots flew several tracking and recovery tasks in a PC-based simulator equipped with moving-horizon and moving-aircraft formats in classic and extended horizon design. Results: The data show that the previous effects favoring a moving-aircraft format of displaying bank information can be replicated with current primary flight display designs. However, the extended horizon design seems to reduce this effect, at least for pilots.

Three ADI display formats were examined: (a) conventional MH; (b) perspective-view aircraft symbol (PAS), which replaced the conventional miniature aircraft symbol with a pictorial moving aircraft symbol; and (c) command, which presented the appropriate direction for recovery using the pitch or roll arrow. Twenty-two participants (10 unmanned aircraft operators, 12 nonoperators) performed a series of trials in a low-fidelity ADI simulator in which they attempted to recover from a series of unusual attitudes. The results revealed that the combination effect differed according to display format. The command display expedited initiation of the roll input regardless of reference frame. The conventional display showed better performance in the MA reference frame. The PAS display improved the total recovery time and pitch input time of nonoperator participants in the MA reference frame. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Airdrop Guidance Display Format for Precision Airdrop Application on an Auxiliary Display Equipped Aircraft</title> <abstract>Objective: To evaluate a new display format for Airdrop Guidance intended to enhance precision-flight capability for high-altitude single-pass airdrop profiles.

Efforts are underway at the Air Force Research Laboratory to minimize the negative effect of human performance variability on high-altitude airdrop accuracy. Precision guidance to the calculated air release point, as presented through the new display, offers potential reduction in flight performance variability. Method: Four U.S. Air Force pilots, current in the C-17, participated in a within-subjects evaluation of the airdrop guidance display. Each pilot was scheduled to fly a total of 16 trials. The out-the-window scene (presented or blanked) effects were also assessed. Results: Results suggest improved performance over existing methods of airdrop guidance as measured by both aircraft position at green light and the comparison between actual and optimal flightpaths.

Exclusion criteria was positive screening for caffeine use disorder. We examined three cognitive functions required for flight performance: (1) vigilance (Mackworth Clock Test), (2) situational awareness, including memory (Corsi block-tapping test) and spatial reasoning (mental rotation test), and (3) reaction time (Deary-Liewald task).

After low-dose caffeine intake (<3 mg/kg body weight), cognitive performance improved significantly in vigilance, situation awareness, and reaction time. Baseline cognitive performance was not different between high (HSQ) and low sleep quality (LSQ) groups. After drinking coffee, however, participants with HSQ demonstrated improvements in vigilance and reaction time, while the LSQ group had improved vigilance only.

Methods: Eight military pilots on flight status performed the primary task of flying a simulated 12.5-h overnight mission in an Air Refueling Part Task Trainer (ARPTT). Response omission to presentation of single- and double-light stimuli displayed in random sequence across the cockpit instrument panel was the metric used to assess choice visual perception task (CVPT) performance. Deviation from an established azimuth heading in the ARPTT during the CVPT was the flight metric used to assess complex motor performance. Speed, lapse, false start, and anticipation were the metrics used to assess psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance during crew rest periods. Results: Significant visual perceptual, complex motor, and psychomotor vigilance (speed and lapse) impairments occurred at 19 h awake in the eight-subject group. CVPT response omissions significantly correlated with ARPTT azimuth deviations at r = 0.97, and with PVT speed at r = -0.92 and lapses at r = 0.90. ARPTT azimuth deviations significantly correlated with PVT speed at r = -0.92 and lapses at r = 0.91. Conclusions: Acute sleep deprivation degrades visual perceptual, complex motor, and simple motor performance. Complex motor impairments strongly correlate with visual perceptual impairments. This research provides support for the use of visual perceptual measures as surrogates of complex motor performance in operational situations where the primary cognitive inputs are through the visual system.

Strategies to overcome the debilitating effects of sleep deprivation include the ingestion of caffeine. Unknown is the efficacy of caffeine use on specific elements of target detection and marksmanship following a modest period of sustained wakefulness. Methods: There were 20 subjects (mean ± SD of 26.7 ± 7.2 yr of age, 179 ± 6 cm in height, and 84.5 ± 10.8 kg in weight) who participated in double-blind caffeine and placebo trials where each trial involved a 24-h control period (with sleep) followed by 22 h of mixed mental and physical activity with no sleep. At the end of this period, subjects engaged in a 1-h rifle-shooting task. Subjects ingested 400, 100, and 100 mg of caffeine or placebo at 7.5, 3, and 0 h, respectively, prior to shooting. Measures of shooting performance included target engagement time (between target appearance and firing), friend-foe discrimination, accuracy, and precision. Results: Most measures of performance were degraded in the placebo sleep-deprived condition, but only the target engagement time and the number of shots fired were restored by caffeine ingestion. Conclusions: These findings concur with other research involving different periods of sleep deprivation, and indicate that the cognitive component of the shooting task (i.e., target detection) can benefit from caffeine whereas the psychomotor component (marksmanship) does not. It appears that once the target is detected, the subject is sufficiently aroused to engage the target regardless of the subject's level of alertness prior to detection.</abstract>""]"

This is partly due to loss of weight information (a reduction in z-axis pressure stimulation), and probably also to incomplete adaptation to the reduced G-level. Maladaptation to an increased G-level postflight causes objects to feel too heavy and weight discrimination to be impaired. Video tapes of hand movements while shaking test objects were made before, during, and after the D-1 Spacelab mission. Movements were faster inflight than preflight, slowed down postflight and returned to baseline by about the third day. Corresponding changes in movement amplitude also occurred. Errors of weight or mass perception during the maladaptation phase may be due to both inadequate monitoring of command signals and to inappropriate scaling of afferent signals. High-acceleration shaking was found to improve mass discrimination but impair weight discrimination.</abstract>', '<title>Transfer of perceptual-motor training and the space adaptation syndrome.</title> <abstract>Perceptual cue conflict may be the basis for the symptoms which are experienced by space travelers in microgravity conditions. Recovery has been suggested to take place after perceptual modification or reinterpretation. To elucidate this process, 10 subjects who repeatedly experienced a visual/vestibular conflict (Purkinje) over trials and days, were then tested in a similar but not identical perceptual situation (pseudo-Coriolis) to determine whether any savings in perceptual adaptation had occurred as compared to an unpracticed control group (N = 10). The practiced subjects experienced lessening dizziness and ataxia within and over sessions. Their response to the new perceptual situation was markedly less than the control group (p less than 0.001). Assessment of ""adaptability,"" in addition to the provocative vestibular tests now in use, may improve prediction of susceptibility to the space adaptation syndrome. An adaptability trait may exist in humans which, properly measured, could be used to predict who would adapt more readily to visual/vestibular conflict and perhaps to environmental stressors in general.</abstract>', ""<title>Wrist vibration affects the production of finely graded forces</title> <abstract>Introduction: It is still unclear how central commands and afferent feedback interact to produce finely graded forces. To explore this question, we experimentally degraded afferent responsiveness using wrist vibration. Methods: Subjects grasped an isometric joystick with their preferred hand and produced forces of different magnitudes and directions according to visually presented vectors. In one condition, the dorsal and palmar sides of the wrist were vibrated at 80 Hz to degrade proprioception; in another condition, the wrist was not vibrated. Results: Response magnitude averaged 2.46 kg of force (kgf) without, and decreased to 1.90 kgf with vibration. The coefficient of magnitude variation was vibration-independent and averaged 0.30 kgf. The directional error of responses and its standard deviation were also vibration-independent, averaging -2.6° and ± 17°, respectively. Subjects' maximum voluntary force was 9.77 kgf without, and decreased to 8.83 kgf with vibration. Conclusion: Our findings clearly indicate that afferent feedback plays a role in the production of finely graded forces, probably by facilitating descending motor commands.</abstract>"", ""<title>Synthesis of ethological studies on behavioural adaptation of the astronaut to space flight conditions</title> <abstract>The motor behaviour of the astronaut as revealed in his movement, posture and orientation is treated as observable evidence of the subject's adaptation to space flight conditions. In addition to the conservative physiological homeostasies, the quantitative description of the astronaut's motor activity in microgravity is postulated in terms of an innovative regulation, within a temporal dynamic. The proposed ethological method consists of first drawing up a specific behavioural repertoire and then of using video recordings of space missions to describe each of the behavioural units observed in the ongoing flux context in which it occurred. Finally the data is quantified into frequencies of occurrence, transition and association and completed with factorial correlation analysis. Comparison of ground training (g = 1) and space flight (g = 0) between the first and last day of a mission up to return to Earth gravity simulated by an anti-orthostatic decubitus experiment, reveals the nature of the adaptive strategies implemented. These strategies are evidence of changes in the behavioural repertoire including the search for predominantly visual environmental cues and the progression of motor skill during the flight. The pre-flight period is defined as a phase involving automizing of motor patterns and the post-flight period as rehabituation of strategies which have already been acquired. The phenomena observed are discussed in terms of the new spatial representation and the body image, constructed by the astronaut during his adaptation. They are considered to be optimizing for the subject's relation to his environment. © 1994.</abstract>"", '<title>Self-motion perception: Assessment by computer-generated animations</title> <abstract>The goal of this research is more precise description of adaptation to sensory rearrangements, including microgravity, by development of improved procedures for assessing spatial orientation perception.

Twelve subjects were assigned to each of 3 perceptual reporting procedures: (a) animation movie selection, (b) written report selection and (c) verbal report generation. The question addressed was: do reports produced by these procedures differ with respect to complexity and reliability? Following repeated (within-day and across-day) exposures to 4 different ""motion profiles,"" subjects either (a) selected movies presented on a laptop computer, or (b) selected written descriptions from a booklet, or (c) generated self-motion verbal descriptions that corresponded most closely with their motion experience. One ""complexity"" and 2 reliability ""scores"" were calculated. Contrary to expectations, reliability and complexity scores were essentially equivalent for the animation movie selection and written report selection procedures. Verbal report generation subjects exhibited less complexity than did subjects in the other conditions and their reports were often ambiguous.

Both RFS and RIQ emphasize development of skills traditionally required for manned aircraft pilots, also considered essential for USAF RPA pilots. Results showed significant negative relationships between the Big Five personality trait of Openness and several RPA training outcomes, and significant incremental variance explained by Openness beyond other predictors. Additionally, RFS and RIQ training outcomes were generally predicted by measures traditionally used for selection into manned aircraft pilot training courses and careers. Together, these findings suggest that personality, specifically Openness scores, and scores on traditional pilot selection measures, can serve as useful indicators in the early identification of RPA pilot talent. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The Relationship between Preparation, Impression Management, and Interview Performance in High-Stakes Personnel Selection: A Field Study of Airline Pilot Applicants</title> <abstract>Objective: The present study investigates how airline pilot applicants prepare for a personnel selection procedure and how this relates to their deceptive and honest impression management (IM) in the job interview and their interview performance. Background: It is thus far unclear how preparation relates to IM in real-world and high-stakes settings. This is of particular importance for the aviation industry, because numerous commercial providers offer preparation courses for selection procedures potentially impacting selection decisions. Method: We conducted a field study of high-stakes job interviews embedded in a selection procedure for airline pilots. Data from 100 interviewees was acquired. Results: The variety of preparation strategies an applicant used was positively correlated with two deceptive IM (faking) strategies in the job interview. Moreover, low effort preparation via social media and guidebooks was positively correlated with overall faking. The variety of preparation and preparation via social media were also positively correlated with honest IM. However, neither the aforementioned preparation nor IM showed significant correlations with the interview performance.

In addition, data were obtained for non‐enlisted applicants tested at Biggin Hill and amateur aviators tested at various flying clubs. The results confirmed previous findings that applicants for pilot training are highly ‘self‐selected’, being much more emotionally stable and more extraverted than the general population. Furthermore, the 16PF profile for the unselected sample was found to be very similar to that for US airline pilots. The pattern of differences between those who succeeded and those who failed in training was as expected. The magnitude of these correlations (in the region of r = .20) was also at the level expected.

Initial efforts to meet the demand focused on cross-training experienced manned aircraft pilots and funneling recent Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) graduates to RPA pilot training. This approach reduced the number of personnel available for manned airframes and is no longer sustainable. In 2009, the USAF established an RPA career field and the Undergraduate RPA Training (URT) course to train officers with no prior flying experience to be RPA pilots. URT selection methods are very similar to those for SUPT. Some important factors for URT applicants are medical flight screening and aptitude tests [Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) and Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM)]. The current study examined the predictive validity of the AFOQT pilot and PCSM composites for URT completion. Method: Subjects were 139 URT students with AFOQT and PCSM scores. The training criterion was URT pass/fail and the pass rate was 74.8%. Results: Both the AFOQT pilot (r 5 0.378) and PCSM (r 5 0.480) composites demonstrated good predictive validity. Discussion: No minimum qualifying PCSM score exists for URT. Had a minimum PCSM score of 25 been used, the pass rate would have been 80.2%; 12 more eliminees would have been screened out compared with the current AFOQT pilot minimum qualifying score of 25.

The primary focus was on identifying factors linked to pilots' Job Satisfaction differentiations over the time course of the pandemic, and proposing measures to mitigate their negative effects. Survey Job Satisfaction data were collected from 203 pilots during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021, and were subsequently measured in a quasi-identical sample of 205 pilots after the pandemic in May 2023. During the pandemic, the results indicate that airline pilots experienced an acute decrease in Job Satisfaction due to the disruptive nature of COVID-19. This decline was primarily attributed to factors such as pay cuts and reduced promotion prospects, which consequently resulted in feelings of limited job security and future uncertainty. Importantly, a substantial recovery of airline pilots JS was observed following the end of the pandemic. In contrast, military pilots' levels remained relatively constant over the duration of the pandemic, as military organizations typically received government provided financial security. To improve commercial sustainability, it is recommended that airline companies enhance their preparedness for future crises by minimizing the financial impact experienced by pilots. Additionally, effective communication strategies should be implemented to address and alleviate uncertainty among pilots.

Material and Methods: The study involved 930 Polish soldiers –members of aircrew. The study was conducted by using a survey designed by the author, as part of the implementation of the National Health Programme 2021–2025. The survey used the research technique computer assisted web interview. Results: Approximately half of the soldiers surveyed (49%) declared that they did not contract COVID-19. Analysis of the results on the frequency of consumption of selected food items showed that most food items respondents consumed at similar levels during the pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period. There was a positive increase in the frequency of consumption of nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables in 14.8%, 15.9% and 19% of respondents, respectively. More than 20% of those surveyed declared that they consumed less restaurant meals, fast food, sweets and sugary drinks. The vast majority of the respondents (77.6%) answered that they did not feel more negative emotions compared to the pre-pandemic period COVID-19 and emotions did not affect their diet. The frequency of physical activity remained the same for 71.9% of soldiers, while 14.9% respondents said they played sport less often than before the pandemic. Overweight was diagnosed in 50.2% of respondents, while 12.8% were obese. More than half of the respondents (56%) declared that their weight had not changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, 25.1% declared that their weight had increased and 8.9% that it had decreased. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic condition did not disrupt the existing lifestyles of most military flying personnel. More than half of the military flying personnel surveyed reported no effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight change. A quarter of soldiers reported weight gain, which was associated with negative changes in diet and physical activity. © 2025, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

Analysis of safety resilience in flight operations during COVID-19 disruptions</title> <abstract>The unexpected spread of the pandemic raised concerns regarding pilots’ skill decay resulting from the significant drops in the frequency of flights by about 70%. This research retrieved 4761 Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) occurrences based on the FDM programme containing 123,140 flights operated by an international airline between June 2019 and May 2021. The FDM severity index was analysed by event category, aircraft type, and flight phase. The results demonstrate an increase in severity score from the pre-pandemic level to the pandemic onset on events that occurred on different flight phases. This trend is not present in the third stage, which indicates that pilots and the safety management system of the airline demonstrated resilience to cope with the flight disruptions during the pandemic. Through the analysis of event severity, FDM enables safety managers to recommend measures to increase safety resilience and self-monitoring capabilities of both operators and regulators. Practitioner summary: The onset of the pandemic led to a rise in the severity of flight data monitoring events in a large airline, likely linked to a lack of operational practice and skills decay. This was demonstrated across different flight phases and aircraft types. In the settled pandemic period, the severity index returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the resilience of individual pilots and safety management systems is critical to operational safety.HIGHLIGHTS The FDM event severity scores significantly increased following the pandemic onset, especially for event categories involving pilot core competencies. The FDM event severity scores stagnated or decreased during the later pandemic stage indicating resilience among the airline pilots and the airline’s safety management system. The airline and pilots demonstrated resilience by effectively mitigating the effects of proficiency decay which took place as the pandemic started. FDM analysis has shown to be effective in establishing a proactive SMS programme to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on aviation safety. © 2023 The Author(s).

Background: The aviation industry has undergone a series of devastating changes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the implications of the pandemic on pilots’ JS are unknown. Methods: Quantitative JS measurements were taken from 203 European and Middle Eastern pilots, during the pandemic (March, 2021), using the shortened Job Descriptive Index and Job In General validated scales. Follow-up semi-structured interviews (April 2021) were conducted with 16 participants to establish pre-pandemic JS levels and identify the degree of change due to COVID-19. Results: Significant JS differences (p <\xa0.001) were observed between military and airline pilots; the former having higher levels. Qualitative findings revealed that airline pilots’ levels decreased due to factors such as job security, pay cuts, opportunities for promotion and skill-fade concerns. Military pilots experienced an increased JS, as state-funded organizations were not substantially affected by COVID-19, which led to a feeling of appreciation and thankfulness. Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to JS of military and airline pilots.

This historical article explores Gemelli’s groundbreaking contributions to understanding spatial cognition, particularly in aviation contexts, decades before contemporary scientific findings. During World War I, Gemelli, a medical officer and pilot, focused on selecting pilots based on their attitudes rather than their physical abilities. His work predated crucial developments in spatial cognition, including concepts of field dependence/independence and environmental representation. Gemelli examined perception through Gestalt psychology, showing that people create mental images of space instead of just recording what they see. Gemelli critically analyzed spatial orientation, distinguishing between ground and aerial navigation and recognizing the complex interaction between internal cognitive characteristics and external environmental factors. He anticipated modern research on spatial representation, emphasizing the dynamic nature of spatial perception and individual differences in cognitive processing. This article highlights Gemelli’s insights in relation to modern science, showcasing his keen understanding of spatial cognition, pilot skills, and perception.

It was found that: 1) increasing vehicle approach velocity yielded a very small (but significant) effect of faster detection of vehicle movement, nevertheless, response variability was relatively large; 2) including the fixed reticle in the FOV produced significantly slower detection at the largest range and the magnitude of the effect was only about 15% of the one sigma value; and 3) increasing background star velocity during this judgment led to slower detection of vehicle movement. While statistically significant, this effect was small and occurred primarily at the largest range.

Then we looked at the impact of deliberate practice in which one aspect of the crisis scenario - the particular malfunction - was unpracticed. We analyzed pilot decision-making performance in response to 160 airborne mechanical malfunctions. We initially found that deliberate practice significantly improves decision-making performance for wholly practiced crises but does not improve decision-making performance when the specific malfunction has not been practiced. We then split decision making for each crisis into two phases: assessment and action selection. For wholly practiced crisis scenarios, additional deliberate practice positively impacts each decision-making phase.

Through extensive research since 1977, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that the predominant underlying cause of these types of accidents involved decisional problems or cognitive information processing. To attack these problems, Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) training materials were developed and tested for ten years. Since the publication of the ADM training manuals in 1987, significant reductions in human performance error (HPE) accidents have been documented both in the U.S. and world wide. However, shortcomings have been observed in the use of these materials for recurrency training and in their relevance to more experienced pilots. The following discussion defines the differences between expert and novice decision makers from a cognitive information processing perspective, correlates the development of expert pilot cognitive processes with training and experience, and reviews accident scenarios which exemplify those processes.

This study investigated whether flight time, cognitive reflection, task-load, metacognition, and perceived stress predicted decision-making (DM) performance during two in-flight training simulations with 104 commercial pilots at Bogota International Airport. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the predictors accounted for 56% of the variance. Cognitive reflection, flight time and performance task load emerged as significant positive predictors. Cognitive reflection significantly moderated the relationship between flight time and DM performance, with pilots scoring lower on cognitive reflection showing improved DM with increased flight time, while controlling for performance task load. The study did not find significant relationships between stress metacognition and DM performance. The study emphasises the significance of advanced training methods in improving pilots’ DM, especially for those with low cognitive reflection. Future research should expand to multiple airlines, address gender balance, and incorporate direct measures of metacognitive monitoring. © 2024 The Author(s).

Results of recent research suggest that aeronautical decision making (ADM) can be improved by training. The purposes of this research are to identify the best ADM mnemonic-based methods for training military pilots in decision making in tactical environments. Methods: There were 60 instructor pilots in the Republic of China Air Force Academy who evaluated the suitability of 5 different ADM methods including SHOR (Stimuli, Hypotheses, Options, Response); PASS (Problem identification, Acquire information, Survey strategy, Select strategy); FOR-DEC (Facts, Options, Risks & Benefits, Decision, Execution, Check); SOAR (Situation, Options, Act, Repeat); and DESIDE (Detect, Estimate, Set safety objectives, Identify, Do, Evaluate). Each was evaluated for six different types of decisions: go/no go; recognition-primed; response selection; resource management; non-diagnostic procedural; and creative problem-solving. Results: The instructor-pilots regarded the SHOR method as the best for time-limited and critical, urgent situations, while they preferred DESIDE for knowledge-based decisions that needed more comprehensive consideration and were less time limited. Discussion: To optimize training effectiveness, it is necessary to provide instruction based around both the SHOR and DESIDE decision-making mnemonic methods to provide comprehensive instruction for coping with all situations in the demanding military aviation environment.

Background: The captain must quickly make appropriate decisions once an aircraft faces emergency. Usually, human error is one primary cause of accidents, which inevitably affects the captain’s decision progress. Method: Ten participants carried out a standard non-normal scenario (cargo smoke). Each participant is equipped with simulation experience and executed three sessions using three different decision models: the DOGAM, DECIDE, and CLEAR. After each session, the situation awareness (SA) and perceived workload were assessed using the Situational Awareness Rating Technology (SART) and NASA-TLX. An in-depth interview was also completed to comprehend their subjective perception of decision-making. Results: Although the CLEAR outperformed the other models in SART and NASA-TLX scores, their performance regarding workload and SA was comparable. The fixing time of DOGAM was the longest, and the other two models were no significant difference. Subjectively, the DECIDE may require a high mental demand by simultaneously processing lots of information and measuring significant changes, whilst the DOGAM may encourage participants follow their own idea, promoting aggressive decisions. Conclusion: This paper clarifies the importance of incorporating decision models into the cockpit and investigates the relatively feasible decision-making model. Variation across our results illustrated applying different decision models to train pilots and solve problems is suggested, thereby improving flight safety. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

The selection context guaranteed high motivation in the participant to exert additional effort during difficult flight tasks. The aim of the study was to obtain information about the sensitivity to mental effort of several physiological measures and to explore the applicability of these measures in real flight. The following measures were used: heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration (frequency and amplitude), blood pressure, eye blinks (frequency, duration, and amplitude), and saliva cortisol. Blood pressure was the only measure that was difficult to obtain during real flights. All physiological measures showed large differences between baseline and flight tasks. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory frequency showed similar results in the simulator and real flight. Blink frequency showed an expected decrease during simulator flight, whereas a large increase was found during real flight. This can be partly explained by eye movements, which were made more frequently during real flight. Blink duration was shorter and amplitude was larger during both flights. This indicates that a combination of blink parameters provides better information about workload than blink frequency alone. Cortisol was not affected by the simulator flight, whereas greatly increased levels were found after the real flight. This indicates that cortisol is not affected by mental effort. G-forces during the real flight most likely caused the increased cortisol levels.</abstract>', '<title>Psychophysiological monitoring under conditions of real and simulated microgravity.</title> <abstract>Dynamics of indices characterizing the process of adaptation of operators to complicated conditions of vital activity was studied with psychophysiological monitoring. This technique is based on the complex analysis of subjective and objective estimations of the current psychoemotional state and physiological and biochemical indices. We analyzed the data obtained during the examination of three healthy volunteers, who participated in the HUBES experiment (135-day isolation in the ground-based model of the orbital station ""Mir""), and during a biorhythmological study conducted by six Russian cosmonauts of the main expeditions on the station ""Mir."" It was shown that psychophysiological monitoring is an informative method for studying different parameters of the operator\'s state and regulatory processes, the dynamics of biological rhythms, and individual characteristics of adaptation. By means of the analysis of a population of the variation in the characteristics of the parameters under study the experimental period of isolation was divided into three stages. The first and third stages were characterized by a relatively high variability, which was minimized at the second stage. The phasic character of the adaptation processes with a phase duration of about 60 days was revealed and a correlation was shown between the dynamics of parameters obtained by means of psychophysiological monitoring and specific features of the system regulation in different phases of the space flight and its simulation. It is suggested that the phases of the minimal variability of the studied characteristics are related to the periods of the minimal reliability of an operator\'s work.

Methods: This cross-sectional study participated 12 experienced male pilots (age = 33.08 (5.21)) from the Spanish Air Force. Participants had to complete a real and a simulated flight mission randomly. The heart rate variability (HRV), anxiety, self-confidence, and rating of perceived exertion were collected before and after both manoeuvres, and HRV was also collected during both simulated and real flights. Results: When studying the acute effects of real and simulated flights, the mean heart rate, the R-to-R interval, the cognitive anxiety and the perceived exertion were significantly impacted only by real flights. Fur-thermore, significant differences in the mean heart rate and RR interval were found when compared to the acute effects of real and simulated flights (with higher acute effects observed in real flights). Additionally, when compared the HRV values during simulated and real flights, significant differences were observed in the RR and heart rate mean (with lower RR interval and higher heart rate mean observed during real flights). Conclusion: Real flights significantly reduced the RR interval and cognitive anxiety while increased the heart rate mean and the rating of perceived exertion, whereas simulated flights did not induce any significant change in the autonomic modulation. © 2021 by the authors.

Method: The subjects performed the same flight mission twice; first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with the BA Hawk MK 51 jet trainer with Gz-forces below +2. The mission included: a) 2 min rest after seating; b) take-off; c) ILS approach in the minimum weather conditions (initial, intermediate and final approach); d) landing tour (visual approach); and e) landing. The heart rates were continuously measured using a small portable recorder developed at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland. The R-R intervals were stored and analyzed with an accuracy of 1 ms. The different phases of each flight were marked in the data by using codes given beforehand for each critical event. Results: The take-off resulted in a significant increase in the heart rate from the resting levels both in the cadets and the flight instructors in both planes. In the simulator the heart rate decreased during the initial approach and slightly increased after it during the intermediate approach. Thereafter the heart rate decreased during the landing tour which seemed to be the least psychologically demanding phase of the simulated flight. The heart rate increased again during the landing but did not exceed the heart rates measured during the take-off and the ILS- approach. There were no statistical differences between the groups. In the jet trainer no decrease in the heart rate could be observed immediately after the take-off, unlike in the case of the simulated flight. The inflight heart rate increased during the final approach, decreased during the landing tour and finally increased during the landing. According to the heart rate analysis the final approach was the most loaded phase of the real flight. The changes towards the phases of final approach and landing were greater among the flight instructors. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between the mean heart rates during the real and the simulated flight. It is suggested that the heart rate changes for most reflected the changes in cognitive workload.</abstract>', '<title>Heart rate variability and performance of commercial airline pilots during flight simulations</title> <abstract>Pilots undergo a variety of stressors that may affect their performance during all phases of flight. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been considered as a reliable indicator of the parasympathetic and sympathetic activities of human autonomic nervous system, which can be used to characterize the sympathetic stress response of pilots during flight. In this study, thirty active commercial airline pilots were recruited to fly three flight segments in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certified A320 flight simulator with each segment at a different carbon dioxide (CO <inf>2</inf> ) concentration on the flight deck. The pilots performed a series of maneuvers of varying difficulty, and their performance was evaluated by FAA designated pilot examiners. The HRV metrics (SDNN, RMSSD and LF/HF ratio) of each pilot both before and during flight simulations were measured with a Movisens EcgMove3 sensor. The average SDNN, RMSSD and LF/HF ratio of the pilots during flight simulations were 34.1 ± 12.7 ms, 23.8 ± 10.2 ms and 5.7 ± 2.8 respectively. Decreased HRV was associated with aging, obesity and performing difficult maneuvers. Both CO <inf>2</inf> exposure and HRV had an independent effect on the pilot performance, while their interaction was not significant. The generalized additive mixed effect model results showed that a pilot performed better on a maneuver when his stress response was lower, as indicated by higher SDNN and RMSSD and lower LF/HF ratio. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in SDNN (21.97 ms) and RMSSD (16.00 ms) and an IQR decrease in LF/HF ratio (4.69) was associated with an increase in the odds of passing a maneuver by 37%, 22% and 20%, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

It is suggested that impaired cognitive performance accounts for most of the accidents during training courses and actual battle. There is a need to define when soldiers ' operational readiness becomes impaired. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of sustained military operations (SUSOPS) on vigilance, reaction time, working memory, and reasoning in order to select good indicators for performance impairment. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using publicly accessible databases (IngentaConnect, PubMed, Science Direct, and Defense Technical Information Center online) that were screened until July 2015. Keywords were military, sustained operations, (cognitive) performance, soldier, and training. Results: Only 7 out of 589 studies met the inclusion criteria. Selected studies were difficult to compare due to different methodologies, cognitive tasks, and military courses. Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory were affected after only a few hours, showing severe impairment. They are linearly related to military stress up to 80 h of SUSOPS. These three indicators needed little recovery time to return to baseline levels. After more than 80 h of SUSOPS, no significant impairments of those indicators were observed. Reasoning becomes impaired after high stress levels of relatively short duration and can remain affected after more than 80 h of SUSOPS. Discussion: Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory are affected after only a few hours while little recovery time is needed. For reasoning to return to baseline values, longer recovery is needed than the time available during SUSOPS. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", ""<title>Ready or not: Enhancing operational effectiveness through use of readiness measures</title> <abstract>Current and future military operations require personnel to perform a multitude of mission tasks. Military personnel are required to execute these tasks, and to perform to high levels of expectation. Many of these tasks are complex and demand substantial cognitive readiness, which may optimize and enhance cognitive performance. Technologies are being developed to aid individual soldiers to successfully complete their missions; however, the proliferation of new technologies, coupled with the varying operational missions, make leveraging cognitive readiness a mandate for the achievement of military effectiveness and enhanced overall performance. It is important to have a militarily relevant psychological battery that can be used to assess each individual's cognitive capabilities and appraisals, factors that enhance military operational effectiveness. Assessing individual cognitive readiness becomes particularly important when researchers broaden their examinations of military effectiveness to assess team cognition, team behavior, and team effectiveness. We discuss the theoretical development and the components of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Readiness Assessment and Monitoring System (RAMS). Data from several studies are presented to illustrate the behavioral profiles of individuals in extreme operational environments. Data show how specific factors (e.g., personality, coping) contribute to performance in operational settings (e.g., command and control, chemical decontamination operations). Understanding the effect of cognitive readiness on overall military effectiveness not only has implications for selection, training, and system design, but also provides the basis for the proactive development and sustainment of optimal performance, both in individual soldiers, and in small teams or military units.

The aim of this study was to observe and report selected physiological, biochemical, psychological, and performance responses to this intense 15-day program of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) EST. Fourteen RAAF participants undertook the EST course. Physiological and psychological responses were collected across the 15 days across outcomes: (1) biochemical markers (blood lactate, interlukin-6, and creatine kinase), (2) performance and anthropometric indices (vertical jump, body mass), and (3) psychological questionnaires profile of mood states, depression anxiety stress scale, Kessler-10 etc.). Creatine kinase concentration increased significantly from baseline to day 5 (p < 0.05) and thereafter remained elevated for the remaining 10 days of EST (128%; p < 0.01). Vertical jump (-10%; p < 0.01) and body mass (-8%; p < 0.01) both decreased across 15 days of EST, while there were no significant change in interlukin-6. Negative psychological responses were observed for mood (p < 0.01), depression (p < 0.05), anxiety (p < 0.01), and stress (p < 0.01) following the EST course. This case study showed the RAAF EST course imposed significant physiological and psychological stress as observed from markers of muscle damage, deterioration in physical performance, substantial weight loss, negative mood, and psychological distress. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.</abstract>', '<title>Development and Validation of the Military Readiness Scale in U.S. Naval Aircrew</title> <abstract>Introduction Readiness is a ubiquitous term in DoD doctrine and has been broadly defined as the ability of military forces to meet the demands of assigned missions. There is currently no criterion standard of military readiness and there is also a lack of published readiness measures for the individual military service member, the fundamental building block of force readiness. This report describes the development and validation of the Military Readiness Scale-15 (MRS-15), a self-report instrument, in U.S. Naval Aircrew. Materials and Methods Scale items were developed by human performance scientists, including a psychometrician. The team developed 19 candidate items, which were administered to Naval Aircrew personnel (N = 164), along with validated measures of theoretically relevant constructs (e.g., pain). Factor structure of the scale was explored with principal components factoring, and Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization. Removal of 4 items yielded a highly consistent, 15-item scale. From the final scale, we derived a Total Military Readiness score with three readiness subscales that we termed General-Psychological, Technical, and Physical. Results We observed robust, age-adjusted relationships in the expected directions, between the Total Military Readiness score and bodily pain, fatigue, occupational stress, mental health symptoms, and sleep disruption. Conclusions The MRS-15 is a preliminarily valid and reliable self-report instrument that holds promise for evaluating perceived readiness. To this end, we conceptualized a ""readiness dashboard""prototype that is informed by MRS-15 data and can be integrated with a representative selection of other measures to display the readiness status of an individual or an entire unit. Altogether, this research can help to inform policy, training, and resourcing efforts to prepare Naval Aircrew for future engagements. © 2025 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

However, the application and analysis of success of these new methodologies are as yet unknown. METHODS: The military adapted the civil reverse periodization training system, composed of 6 wk and five sessions per week. For the first 3 wk soldiers performed two sessions with the objective of increasing the maximal strength of the upper and lower body muscles, and three sessions of short high-intensity interval training (HIIT). In the following 3 wk they combined two endurance HIIT and two resistance HIIT sessions with military equipment while conducting a military task. RESULTS: After the training a significant body mass index decrease was found, along with an increase in lower limb muscular strength, aerobic and anaerobic performance, resilience, stress tolerance, and psychological flexibility. Regarding the ratio of acceptance there was an increased ratio compared to previous years of 7%. In addition, married soldiers with children presented greater resilience, stress tolerance, psychological flexibility, and a higher ratio of success. DISCUSSION: Accepted soldiers presented greater psychological status and stress tolerance, highlighting the importance of the work of the unit psychologists to reinforce and monitor the psychometric profile of the soldiers as well as their intrinsic characteristics of personality and emotionality. The greater baseline physical condition and higher performance in all physical tests proves how reverse periodization training models are a great stimuli and training approach in soldiers. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>']"

Each subject completed two questioning sessions and two working sessions, the first time during a period of low traffic and the second time during a period of high traffic. For the questioning sessions standardized questionnaires were used. For all investigated working sessions, different aspects of the subjective and objective workload were recorded. Before and after each session, a saliva sample for assessing the concentration of secreted cortisol was taken. The questionnaire parameters represented psychological stress symptoms, such as complaints of physical discomfort, depression, negative self-communication, work-increased anxiety, coping behaviour and subjective rating, and interpretation of various aspects of the working situation. The mean values measured were within the normal range, and only a few significant differences between the two questioning sessions were found. However, about 10 to 15% of the ATCs showed elevated values in psychological stress symptoms to an extent indicating that they might have serious stress problems at work and/or in their private life. The investigated working sessions showed that the ATCs’ subjective ratings correspond clearly to their cortisol response and the objective workload.

This study explores the relationship between occupational health and safety (OHS) systems and the psychological well-being of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs), focusing on factors such as perceived safety, job satisfaction, stress, and mental strain. Conducted within the Hellenic Air Navigation Services Provider, the research adopts a cross-sectional design using a structured questionnaire distributed nationwide. The study draws upon the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) theoretical framework to examine how organizational resources, such as training, clarity of role, supervisor support, and employee autonomy, interact with job demands to shape occupational outcomes. Special emphasis is placed on understanding how the presence and awareness of structured OHS systems influence ATCOs’ perceptions of safety and well-being. Our analysis indicated that participants who reported the presence of an OHS system perceived their workplace as significantly safer than those who reported no such system. Hence, the existence of structured measures allows ATCOs to feel confident in their work environment. By assessing a range of psychosocial and organizational variables, this study seeks to contribute to both the academic discourse and practical strategies aimed at improving safety culture and psychological resilience in high-risk work environments.

Combined with equipment for tower control simulations, this standard assesses and counts the scores of controllers in different states, namely, sober, fatigue, stress, and fatigue & stress. We tested the control effect distributions of four states through the Kruskal-Wallis test and analyzed whether the bad working states were statistically significant for each control effect item. The study found that the bad working states are statistically significant for standard radiotelephony communications, flight progress strips, safety separation, instruction timing, situational awareness, and total control effect score in the control effects. Moreover, the research revealed that bad working states are not statistically significant for equipment inspection, external environment scan, and safety awareness in the control effect. Further, forced pair comparisons of the substantial control effect items showed that controllers have adverse statistically significant effects on the use of flight progress strips, situational awareness, and the total score of control effects when controllers are in a stress state. Meanwhile, they have an adverse statistically significant effect on the standard radiotelephony communications, safety separation and instruction timing, flight progress strips, situational awareness, and the total score of control effects when controllers are under a fatigue & stress state. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>', '<title>A Mixed-Method Study on Job Satisfaction Among Air Traffic Controllers During the Pandemic: The Roles of Work-Family Interface and Resilience</title> <abstract>Objective: To investigate whether workload is negatively related to job satisfaction, directly and indirectly, via work-family conflict, and conditional on resilience levels. Background: Covid-19 restriction measures severely affected the aviation sector leading air traffic controllers to face periodic fluctuations in air traffic volume. Despite their key role in ensuring the efficiency and safety of air traffic management, little is known about the psychological issues faced by air traffic controllers during the pandemic. Method: A total of 168 Italian air traffic controllers completed an online self-report survey assessing workload, work-family conflict, job satisfaction, resilience, and Covid-19-related experience. Descriptive statistics and moderated mediation analyses were performed. To deepen the quantitative results, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted, and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Workload was positively related to work-family conflict which, in turn, was negatively associated with job satisfaction. Resilience buffered this association. The following six main themes emerged from the interviews: the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; double-edged job characteristics; job-related risk stressors; protective resources; work-life interface; and consequences. Conclusion: Air traffic controllers who were confronted with sudden increases in air traffic volume were more likely to experience work-family conflict and then be less satisfied with their job. However, resilience was a protective factor against lower job satisfaction under high work-family conflict levels. Qualitative results deepened these findings. The practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>An information-processing interpretation of air traffic control stress</title> <abstract>The air traffic controller's job is inherently stressful, resulting in a variety of stress-related symptoms and illnesses.

To facilitate the understanding of diagnostic errors in real-world primary care settings that use electronic health records (EHRs), this study explored the use of the situational awareness (SA) framework from aviation human factors research. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted involving reviews of EHR data followed by semi-structured interviews of selected providers from two institutions in the USA. The study population included 380 consecutive patients with colorectal and lung cancers diagnosed between February 2008 and January 2009. Using a pre-tested data collection instrument, trained physicians identified diagnostic errors, defined as lack of timely action on one or more established indications for diagnostic work-up for lung and colorectal cancers. Twenty-six providers involved in cases with and without errors were interviewed. Interviews probed for providers' lack of SA and how this may have influenced the diagnostic process. Results: Of 254 cases meeting inclusion criteria, errors were found in 30 of 92 (32.6%) lung cancer cases and 56 of 167 (33.5%) colorectal cancer cases. Analysis of interviews related to error cases revealed evidence of lack of one of four levels of SA applicable to primary care practice: information perception, information comprehension, forecasting future events, and choosing appropriate action based on the first three levels. In cases without error, application of the SA framework provided insight into processes involved in attention management. Conclusions: A framework of SA can help analyse and understand diagnostic errors in primary care settings that use EHRs.</abstract>"", '<title>The good and bad of group conformity: A call for a new programme of research in medical education</title> <abstract>Context: Given that a significant portion of medical education occurs in various social settings (small groups, large classes, clinical environments), it is critical to examine how group members interact. One type of influence on these interactions is conformity, whereby an individual changes his or her own behaviour to match incorrect responses of others in a group. Conformity to peer pressure has been replicated in experimental research conducted in many countries over the last 60 years. There is newly emerging empirical evidence of this effect in medical education, suggesting that subtle motivations and pressures within a group may prevent students from challenging or questioning information that seems incorrect. Objectives: This narrative review aims to present an overview of theory and findings in research into conformity in the fields of social psychology, business, sociology and aviation theory to demonstrate its direct relevance to medical education and the health professions. Methods: We searched online databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and ProQuest) from the University of Calgary catalogue. We also searched citations in articles reviewed and references provided by colleagues. We limited our narrative review to publications released between 1950 and 2012. Results: Group conformity behaviour may be one of a number of communication challenges associated with interprofessional care, and may represent a factor contributing to the burden of adverse events. This paper calls for a new programme of research into conformity in medical education that provides systematic empirical evidence of its relevance and applications in education, health care and practice. Conclusions: This review reveals decades of anecdotal and empirical evidence that conformity is a pervasive phenomenon across disciplines. Further research is needed to elucidate which situations pose the greatest risk for the occurrence of conformity, how to manage it in practice and its implications for patient safety. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>', ""<title>A cognitive blueprint of collaboration in context: Distributed cognition in the psychiatric emergency department</title> <abstract>Objective: The complex cognitive processes that underlie human performance in 'messy' contexts such as critical care medicine suggest a need for a cognitive model with broad scope to support the understanding of error in such domains. The objective of this research is to characterize the cognition that underlies patient care in the domain of emergency psychiatry in order to enhance the understanding of error in this context. Methods and materials: The theoretical framework of distributed cognition has been used to study collaborative decision-making in a number of similarly complex environments such as airline cockpits and air traffic control towers. These environments share certain characteristics with the critical care domain: the work is collaborative in nature, it is supported by artifacts that can be studied directly, and the consequences of error are dire. However, the nature of the work in this domain and the artifacts used to support it are unique. The application of the theoretical constructs of distributed cognition to this context is necessary in order to characterize the collective thinking that underlies critical care. Our research uses a combination of ethnographic and interview data to derive a distributed cognitive model of the psychiatric emergency department (PED), a high volume clinical unit dealing exclusively with the acute phases of psychiatric crises. The dynamics of workflow within the department are complex: several types of clinician collaborate by forming temporary multidisciplinary teams that attach to and manage particular patients. The component members of these teams change over time. Results: Using the theoretical framework of distributed cognition, we interpreted the collected data to derive a cognitive model of the distribution of work and information flow in the PED. This modeling process has revealed several latent flaws in the system related to the underlying distribution of cognition across teams, time, space and artifacts. Conclusions: The characterization of this distribution has enhanced our understanding of the cognitive dynamics underlying error in this environment, and will serve to guide future research on error management in the ED and inform the development of context-appropriate error-management systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A multi-professional qualitative study</title> <abstract>Background: Professional intrapersonal and interpersonal competences (IICs) form an important part of medical expertise but are given little attention during clinical training. In other professional fields such as psychotherapy, education and aviation, training in IICs is an integral part of education and practice. In medicine, IICs tend to actually decline during studies. To date it is unclear why IICs are given less attention in medicine, despite evidence for their importance in the treatment process. In view of this, the study examined the role of IICs in the treatment process, the current situation of IIC training in medicine and, most importantly, the reasons for the comparatively low focus on IICs in the clinical training of medical students. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 experts from a variety of medical specialties and non-medical professions that provide a training with a stronger focus on IIC development. The interviews were evaluated using grounded theory. Results: The experts confirmed the idea that IICs are an equally important component in the treatment process, along with medical knowledge and technical skills. They also described large differences between the IICs possessed by physicians but noted a general developmental need. The key shortcoming was perceived to be a deep-seated defensiveness towards learning from mistakes and deficits e.g. through reflection and feedback. The interaction of different factors that seem to be reasons for this defensiveness and perpetuate it were identified: lack of support in dealing with insecurities in the face of responsibility; the notion of medicine as a science with the categories of right and wrong answers; and a range of pressures arising from the setting, such as hierarchical, economic and competition pressures. Conclusion: Our study showed, that the defensive attitude towards learning from mistakes and deficits especially in the field of IICs appears to be a subtle but powerful obstacle for implementing IICs in medical training, in contrast to other professional fields. This obstacle is sustained by various underlying barrier factors. We therefore propose that changes should be made within a cultural transformation targeting this defensive mindset and culture and its presumed reasons. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract>', '<title>""You\'re a trainee telling your consultant to hold their question until later"": Using a resident-led faculty development workshop to explore trainee-consultant expertise role-reversal</title> <abstract>Background: Medical education traditionally involves directional flow of knowledge/skills/attitudes from a senior to junior individual. However, medical training also provides opportunities for expertise role-reversal, where the direction of flow is reversed. Unlike fields such as aviation, medicine has not yet begun to fully realise the educational potential of this approach. Objective: To better understand how role-reversal is viewed by medical education participants, necessary for its use as a tool to advance both education and patient care. Methods: A senior resident designed and led a feedback-writing workshop for her own consultants (conducted 2022). After the session, eight consultants were interviewed in a semi-structured format. Analysis was conducted using the Stenfors-Hayes phenomenographical approach. Results: A multiplicity of experiential perspectives was identified by both consultants (teacher/participant/supporter/hierarchy member/colleague/holder of multiple perspectives) and trainee (presenter/subordinate/learner/researcher). The exercise increased appreciation and awareness of the complexity of the trainee-consultant educational-power relationship, though both parties maintained traditional hierarchy despite altered informational flow. Participants often held multiple articulated experiential perspectives simultaneously. Conclusions: Consultants were able to assume a learning mindset while simultaneously maintaining awareness of their existing hierarchical relationship to the trainee-presenter; the trainee, conversely, struggled to adopt the teacher mindset. Deliberately viewing moments where trainees present new information to consultants as expertise role-reversal may provide a starting point for more equitable knowledge exchange between both parties in the clinical routine, and a foil for epistemic injustice. Increasing recognition and use of expertise role reversal can play a critical role in improving educational culture.; Hintergrund: Während der ärztlichen Ausbildung werden traditionellerweise Wissen und Fähigkeiten von erfahrenen Ärzt:innen und Fachkräften auf die auszubildenden Ärzt:innen übertragen. Die Ausbildung bietet jedoch auch Gelegenheiten zur didaktischen Rollenumkehr, wo ältere oder erfahrenere Ärzt:innen von jüngeren lernen. Im Gegensatz z.B. zur Luftfahrt, ist dieser Ansatz in der Medizin in seinem didaktischen Potential noch nicht gründlich erforscht. Zielsetzung: Die Zielsetzung dieser Studie ist es, zu untersuchen, wie Teilnehmende an einer ärztlichen Fortbildung eine didaktische Rollenumkehr erleben. Dies könnte sowohl in der Ausbildung als auch in der Praxis zu Verbesserungen der Zusammenarbeit und des Wissensaustauschs führen. Projektbeschreibung: Ein:e Ärzt:in im 2. Jahr ihrer Facharztausbildung (Onkologie, „resident“ im kanadischen Ausbildungssystem) führte eine an ihre Ausbilder („consultants“) gerichtete Fortbildung durch. Das Thema der Fortbildung war das Verfassen von schriftlichem Feedback. Acht an der Fortbildung teilnehmende Fachärzt:innen und die vortragende Ärzt:in nahmen danach an halbstrukturierten Interviews teil; die Daten wurden phenomenografisch nach Stenfor-Hayes ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Es konnten mehrere Perspektiven identifiziert werden, auf deren Basis die anwesenden Fachärzt:innen und die auszubildende Ärzt:in die Fortbildung bewerteten. Dazu gehörten: Lehrkraft, Workshop-Teilnehmer:in, Unterstützer:in, Kolleg:in, Vorgesetze:r innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie (Fachärzt:innen), bzw Vortragende, Untergebene, Forscher:in (vortragende Assistenzärzt:in). Teilnehmende beschrieben auch mehrere gleichzeitig eingenommene Perspektiven. Die Fortbildung führte allseits zu einer klaren Anerkennung und tieferem Verständnis des Arbeitsverhältnisses und der Ausbildungsverantwortung zwischen Lehrkräften und Auszubildenden. Die deutlich unterschiedlichen Positionen in der traditionellen Hierarchie wurden jedoch durchweg gefühlt eingehalten, trotz der umgekehrten Richtung der didaktischen Tätigkeit. Schlussfolgerung: Fachärzt:innen und auch der/die anwesende Chefärzt:in konnten sich in die Rolle der/des Lernenden hineinversetzen, obwohl sie sich gleichzeitig der Verantwortung und Weisungsbefugtheit gegenüber der auszubildenden Ärzt:in bewusst waren. Diese jedoch tat sich zunächst schwer damit, innerlich die Rolle der Lehrkraft einzunehmen. Im klinischen Alltag gibt es häufig Situationen, in denen Assistenzärzt:innen, PJler, usw Fachärzt:innen oder Chefärzt:innen neue oder zusätzlich Informationen zu ihren Patienten geben, und solche Situationen könnten auch als didaktische Rollenumkehr aufgefasst werden. Falls eine situationsbezogen bewusste didaktische Rollenumkehr zu einer akzeptierten Praxis während der ärztliche Ausbildung werden sollte, könnte dies auch der epistemischen Ungerechtigkeit entgegenwirken, die sonst leicht aufgrund der Differenzen innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie auftreten kann und etwaige wichtige Beiträge und Einblicke innerhalb eines Teams unterbinden kann. © © 2025 Preti et al.</abstract>']"

An interest in the acquisition of piloting skills has led a number of researchers to question the relative transfer of simulated instrument training to instrument and contact flight. In this study, we examined the transfer of simulated instrument training from Device 2F101, the operational flight trainer for the T-2C aircraft, to actual instrument and contact flight for level speed change and standard-rate turn maneuvers. Trainees were randomly assigned to one of three training levels (two, four, or eight simulator flights) and to one of two aircraft flight conditions following training (contact or basic instruments) in a counterbalanced sequence. Altitude, air speed, and heading errors in deviations from controlled flight were recorded as measures of training effectiveness. The most notable finding indicates significant and equal transfer of instrument training to contact and instrument flight for the maneuvers selected. Other findings indicate differential learning rates for the two maneuvers but also indicate equal final performance on each maneuver for both types of flight. Finally, training mix (for aircraft or simulator training trial) was found to have no effect on student performance after eight trials. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Students from the beginning and advanced instrument courses at the University of Illinois were trained to criterion in the PCATD on a wide range of tasks and were then retrained to criterion in the airplane on the same tasks. Other students were trained to criterion on the same tasks only in the airplane. Comparisons of trials to criterion in the airplane for the 2 groups, their times to complete each flight lesson in the airplane, and their course completion times were used to assess the training effectiveness of the PCATD. Transfer savings were generally positive and substantial when new tasks were introduced but low when tasks already learned in previous lessons were reviewed. A comparison of course completion times showed savings of 3.9 hr in the airplane for the PCATD group compared to the airplane-control group.</abstract>', ""<title>Training Effectiveness of Whole Body Flight Simulator Motion: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis</title> <abstract>We present a meta-analysis of 24 effect sizes from transfer of training experiments using whole body simulator motion as an independent variable. Three moderator variables were investigated: experiment design, task type, and subjects' experience. Due to the large heterogeneity of the included experiments, we used a random-effects model. Correction for measurement error was applied. The results revealed an overall transfer effect in favor of motion (d = 0.51). Effects were weaker in true transfer (d = 0.10) than in quasi-transfer with different (d = 0.73) and identical (d = 1.19) motion, stronger for helicopter (d = 0.86) and disturbance tasks (d = 0.84) than for maneuvering fixed-wing aircraft (d = 0.07), and stronger for subjects without flight experience (d = 1.57) than for pilots with intermediate (d = 0.53) and expert (d = -0.01) experience. In conclusion, motion seems important for flight-naive individuals learning tasks with external disturbances or control of vehicles with low dynamic stability, but not for experts learning fixed-wing aircraft maneuvering tasks.

As part of the programme of research related to the production of the Micropat automated testing system, a number of studies were carried out to identify, the parameters accounting for the functional dissimilarity of these two tasks. The variables examined were: Display mode (pursuit versus compensatory), number of dimensions (one versus two), control law, and assignment of controls to limbs. While varying control law mixture had a relatively small effect on task intercorrelations, both variation in display mode and number of dimensions substantially reduced them. The effects of limb assignment were complex, though in general they showed that for two-dimensional tasks the important factor was whether control was carried out using a single limb rather than using separate limbs for each dimension. After practice, the actual control devices and limbs used were relatively less important. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Dichotic Listening and Psychomotor Task Performance as Predictors of Naval Primary Flight-Training Criteria</title> <abstract>A statistical evaluation of the automated dichotic listening task (DLT) and psychomotor tasks (PMTs) indicated that both contributed to the prediction of primary flight-training criteria. Before the main analyses, the extreme skewness of the DLT and PMT error measures was corrected by log transformations, and between-squadrons differences in flight grades were removed by transformations based on z scores. Primary flight grades were highly correlated with the psychomotor scores (rs = -.26 to -.41) and moderately correlated with the dichotic listening scores (rs = -.22 to -.28). These rs were significant at an experiment-wise alpha of. 05. Multiple regression analysis indicated an even stronger validity coefficient when a combination of the performance measures was used (R =. 442). Furthermore, the 19.5% of flight grade variance accounted for by the performance-based tests was largely independent of the 16.6% variance accounted for by a combination of current selection tests and demographic variables.

In Experiment 1, an adaptive procedure measured the minimum viewing duration necessary for 75% performance in an aircraft classification task at various nonfoveal locations. Participants' critical tracking ability was also assessed using a central attitude display. Recognition deteriorated with eccentricity, and a wide distribution of recognition and tracking abilities was found. Experiment 2 combined the tasks; recognition was designated the primary task. Dual-task measures included the change in recognition accuracy and the increase in tracking error. Individuals' recognition thresholds (Experiment 1) failed to predict their dual-task tracking performance (Experiment 2). Notably, viewers' critical tracking ability predicted their success in preserving dual-task aircraft recognition. Recognition biases favoring the upper visual field were identified; this is consistent with a biased spatial attention system.

The objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of the post-accident sequelae for professionals who have survived AMT accidents. The hope is that this understanding will empower the industry to better support survivors and plan for the contingencies of post-accident recovery.Methods: Qualitative methods were used to explore the experience of flight crew members who have survived an AMT accident.

Across the themes survivors reported that industry and company response varied greatly, ranging from generous support, understanding and action to make safety improvements, to little response or action and lack of attention to survivor needs.Conclusion: Planning for AMT post-accident response was identified to be lacking in scope and quality. More focused efforts are needed to assist and support the survivors as they regain both their personal and professional lives following the accident.

One particularly interesting example is that manual rotation actions facilitate mental rotations in the same direction. The present study extends this research in two fundamental ways. First, Experiment 1 demonstrates that not only manual rotations facilitate mental rotations but that mental rotations also facilitate subsequent manual rotations. Second, Experiments 2 and 3 targeted the mechanisms underlying this interplay. Here, manual steering wheel rotations produced salient visual effects, namely the rotation of either a plane or a horizon in an aviation display. The rotation direction of these visual effects either did or did not correspond to the direction of the manual rotation itself. These experiments clearly demonstrate an impact of sensory action effects: Mental rotations facilitate manual rotations with visual effects of the same direction (as the mental rotation), irrespective of the direction of the manual rotation. These findings highlight the importance of effect anticipation in action planning. As such they support the contentions of ideomotor theory and shed new light on the cognitive source of the interplay between visual imagery and motor control. © 2012 American Psychological Association.</abstract>', ""<title>Rotary acceleration of a subject inhibits choice reaction time to motion in peripheral vision</title> <abstract>Studied the effect of S's rotary acceleration upon choice reaction time (RT) to an accelerating target in peripheral vision, with the level of acceleration and the viewing angle of the visual target as variables. 12 commercial airline pilots were tested in a rotation device under conditions of visual stimulation alone and visual-plus-rotary stimulation.

Moreover, corporate aviation departments and commercial air carriers have vested interests in hiring those applicants who have the propensity to perform effectively in a team environment. As a continuation of ongoing research in pilot resource selection, the authors have examined the efficacy of binary logistic regression in screening candidates for instructor pilot upgrade by analyzing psychological surveys of 77 commercial pilots based on the Big Five Personality Inventory, the Leadership Intelligence Quotient (LIQ) Self-Assessment and three select attribute scales (Mach V, locus-of-control, and self-monitoring scales). Results of this research indicated a significant relationship between leader decision-making and personality attributes complementing team formation. In this particular study, 36 experienced instructor pilots and 41 line pilots were categorized with an overall accuracy of 93 percent employing a two-variable model based on Machiavellian view and self-monitoring as independent or predictor variables. These results underscored the efficacy of logistic regression as a statistical methodology in human resource selection and these psychological dimensions as a means of screening pilot candidates for program assignment. The demand among commercial air carriers and corporate aviation for greater consistency and validity of aircrew resource selection methods grows continuously. In the past, the emphasis has been on evaluating technical qualifications and operational experience. There has been no shortage of applicants meeting the basic standard in these areas. The challenge today and in the future is to go beyond that stage of evaluation to develop more effective means of measuring the social aspects of the human variable in the aviation safety equation. Selection protocols are under close, continuous scrutiny and now include personality and temperament characteristics related to crew coordination and team assimilation (Chidester, 1991). Research suggested that in the past selection protocols have suffered in predictive validity with content remaining basically unchanged (Damos, 1995). These protocols in the past have indicated higher predictive validity in the training program, not in the operational environment (Damos, 1996).

This paper reports program results from 1981-1991. Following subject identification, treatment consists of three phases: biofeedback relaxation therapy, ground-based desensitization training and in-flight desensitization therapy with a pilot-flight surgeon. Employing a definition of cure used by the RAF, success was compared with that of the RAF and USAF programs. A total of 22 student pilots have undergone rehabilitation, 17 of whom have been successfully treated for a success rate of 77%. This is comparable to success rates of other programs.

One group received 10 sessions of confidence building and desensitization training (BT); a second group received 10 sessions of EMG and temperature biofeedback (FB); a third group received 10 sessions of BT and 10 sessions of FB (BTFB); and a fourth group received no treatment (C).

The program consisted of an Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise in which research participants learn through operant conditioning techniques to regulate several physiological responses to suppress their symptoms. We evaluated training progress during rotating-chair motion sickness tests. We assessed motion sickness tolerance by calculating the number of cumulative rotations that research participants were able to achieve in the rotating chair prior to reaching their major malaise endpoint. We rated motion sickness symptoms using a standard diagnostic scale. We obtained physiological data from one pilot during a training flight in an F-18 aircraft after completion of his training. Results demonstrate a significant increase in tolerance to laboratory-induced motion sickness tests and a reduction in autonomic nervous system response levels following training. During subsequent flight qualification tests on F-18 and T-38 aircraft, both pilots were successful at controlling their airsickness and were returned to active flight status.</abstract>', '<title>The Italian Air Force rehabilitation programme for air-sickness.</title> <abstract>Motion Sickness, or kinetosis, is a complex clinical syndrome usually classified according to the environmental situation evoking the symptoms. Among the various forms of motion sickness, air sickness has a significant impact on aircrew readiness and is often a cause for the grounding of aircrew. Unfortunately, standards for clinical testing to accurately predict the sensitivity of each individual to air-sickness are currently lacking. Furthermore, pharmacological prevention is contraindicated for aircrews, whose cognitive tasks involve a high level of vigilance. Therefore, a number of Air Forces have developed their own rehabilitation programmes to counteract air-sickness effects on flight personnel. These programmes may differ in several aspects, such as their duration, instruments used, costs and the technical characteristics of the rehabilitation team. However, reports in the specialized literature, refer to high rates of success, despite the above-mentioned differences. In the autumn of 2000, the Italian Air Force (ITAF) also began its own rehabilitation programme for air-sickness desensitisation. The programme was developed at the Aerospace Medicine Department of the ITAF Flight Test Centre, at the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base, Italy. The ITAF rehabilitation course lasts two weeks, and candidates are first classified according to their clinical history and to their reaction to the Coriolis Stress Test. Thereafter, subjects undergo a personalized desensitisation programme, involving increasingly more intense nauseogenic stimuli by means of various devices. At the same time, a psychological approach, based on autogenous training and cognitive-behavioural therapy, is adopted. The present report refers to data from 17 subjects treated from January 2001. The current clinical outcome is extremely encouraging, with a success rate of 88%. Nevertheless, several aspects of motion sickness rehabilitation are still under investigation, and further research programmes, aimed at improving the final clinical outcome and prolonging the benefits of rehabilitation, are needed.</abstract>', ""<title>The effect of autogenic training and biofeedback on motion sickness tolerance</title> <abstract>Background: Motion sickness is characterized by symptoms of vomiting, drowsiness, fatigue and idiosyncratic changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses such as heart rate (HR) and skin temperature (ST). Previous studies found that symptoms of motion sickness are controllable through self- regulation of ANS responses and the best method to teach such control is autogenic-feedback (biofeedback) training. Recent experiments indicated that biofeedback training is ineffective in reducing symptoms of motion sickness or in increasing tolerance to motion. Hypothesis: If biofeedback facilitates learning of ANS self-regulation then autogenic training with true feedback (TFB) should lead to belief control over ANS responses and better motion tolerance than autogenic training with false feedback (FFB). If there is a relationship between ANS self-regulation and coping with motion stress, a significant correlation should be found between amounts of control over ANS responses and measures of motion tolerance and/or symptoms of motion sickness. Method: There were 3 groups of 6 subjects exposed for 6 weeks to weekly sessions of Coriolis stimulation to induce motion sickness. Between the first and second Coriolis sessions, subjects in the experimental groups received five episodes of autogenic training with either true (group TFB) or false (group FFB) feedback on their HR and ST. The control group (CTL) received no treatment. Results: Subjects learned to control their HR and ST independent of whether they received true or false feedback. Learned control of ST and HR was not related to severity of motion sickness or subject's ability to withstand Coriolis stimulation following treatment. Conclusions: A lack of significant correlation between these variables suggested that subjects were not able to apply their skills of ANS self-regulation in the motion environment, and/or such skills had little value in reducing symptoms of motion sickness or enhancing their ability to withstand rotations.</abstract>""]"

Little doubt exists as to the impact that conditions such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance-related disorders have on the conduct of safe flight. Nevertheless, different compulsive sexual behaviors (CSBs), which now are thought to share similar origins and associated comorbidity, can similarly affect impulse control, judgment, concentration, and insight. Yet, these conditions frequently are handled administratively (if not legally). Moreover, in practice CSBs fall within a spectrum of behaviors from 'normative' nonparaphilic sexuality to more deviant paraphilic behavior. Through the presentation of five selected cases seen at the Naval Operational Medicine Institute, this article explores examiner difficulty in establishing a diagnosis, discusses models useful in understanding the origins of these disorders, and highlights critical elements in establishing aeromedical disposition. The authors conclude that CSBs may be associated with anxiety, dysphoria, a pattern of increased risk taking, a high threshold for arousal, and poor judgment, which may impact the safety of flight.

However, not all of these aspects are equally important for the success and safety of a flight. When investigating the influence of a stressor on flight performance, it is important to understand not only which flight performance aspects are important for the success and the safety of the flight, but also which of these aspects will most likely be affected by reduced alertness. METHOD: A total of 136 helicopter pilots of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) of all qualification levels were invited to participate in a three-round ranking Delphi study. RESULTS: A total of 41 (30%) helicopter pilots completed the first questionnaire round and 20 (77%) flight instructors completed the ranking round. The top ten skills elements comprised seven nontechnical skills (NTS), namely, awareness of the environment, decision making, workload management, stress management, planning and coordinating, general knowledge, and basic fitness; and three technical skills (TS), that is, advanced aircraft handling, flight maneuvers and procedures, and abnormal and emergency procedures. The top three ranked skill elements (awareness of environment, decision making, and workload management) were considered by the flight instructors to be highly influenced by reduced pilot alertness. CONCLUSION: NTS are considered more important and more affected by reduced pilot alertness during operational helicopter flight compared to TS. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Investigating Offshore Helicopter Pilots’ Cognitive Load and Physiological Responses during Simulated In-Flight Emergencies</title> <abstract>Objectives: This study was designed to explore pilots’ emergency response performance by collecting real-time physiological and cognitive workload data during pre-defined offshore helicopter scenarios in a flight simulator. Background: Qualification processes require helicopter pilots to complete scheduled simulation training to ensure competency in areas that would otherwise be too dangerous to practice while flying the actual helicopter. Unfortunately, little is known about how effective this simulation training is in regard to cognitive and physiological responses. Methods: Ten qualified pilots completed six flight simulations while real-time eye tracking and physiological data were collected. The pilots were assigned to one of two groups based on their regular flying position (First Officer (FO) or Captain). Results: The findings indicated that there is a significant difference in maximal Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA<inf>max</inf>) and maximal heart rate (HR<inf>max</inf>) values between the two groups while completing the same in-flight emergency scenarios. Conclusions: Results suggest that FOs found the sessions more cognitively demanding and also indicated they would benefit from learning how Captains conduct their radial scan of instruments. Therefore, it is recommended that visual search patterns are included in initial training, all flight simulator training includes eye tracking, heart rate data are collected, and that future longitudinal research follows new pilots through their training/upgrading process. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The differential effect of sustained operations on psychomotor skills of helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Flying a helicopter is a complex psychomotor skill requiring constant control inputs from pilots. A deterioration in psychomotor performance of a helicopter pilot may be detrimental to operational safety. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that psychomotor performance deteriorates over time during sustained operations and that the effect is more pronounced in the feet than the hands. The subjects were helicopter pilots conducting sustained multicrew offshore flight operations in a demanding environment. The remote flight operations involved constant workload in hot environmental conditions with complex operational tasking. METHODS: Over a period of 6 d 10 helicopter pilots were tested. At the completion of daily flying duties, a helicopter-specific screen-based compensatory tracking task measuring tracking accuracy (over a 5-min period) tested both hands and feet. Data were compared over time and tested for statistical significance for both deterioration and differential effect. RESULTS: A statistically significant deterioration of psychomotor performance was evident in the pilots over time for both hands and feet. There was also a statistically significant differential effect between the hands and the feet in terms of tracking accuracy. The hands recorded a 22.6% decrease in tracking accuracy, while the feet recorded a 39.9% decrease in tracking accuracy. DISCUSSION: The differential effect may be due to prioritization of limb movement by the motor cortex due to factors such as workload-induced cognitive fatigue. This may result in a greater reduction in performance in the feet than the hands, posing a significant risk to operational safety. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Is It All about the Mission? Comparing Non-technical Skills across Offshore Transport and Search and Rescue Helicopter Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: The research objective of the current study was to examine and compare the non-technical skills utilized by search and rescue and offshore transport helicopter pilots. Background: Non-technical skills encompass the interpersonal and cognitive skills necessary for safe and efficient team performance in high-risk environments. There is a lack of research investigating non-technical skill use during helicopter flight or assessing differences in skills according to mission parameters. Method: The current study comprised 28 semi-structured qualitative interviews based upon the critical incident technique (16 offshore transport pilots, 12 search and rescue pilots). Interviews were thematically coded to identify, and compare, non-technical skills. Results: All key non-technical skills were reported across both pilot groups. Differences were identified at the element level of skills across the groups (e.g., while both groups reported utilizing situational awareness, elemental sub-components were based upon different attentional factors). A category for cognitive readiness was identified specific to search and rescue—this category encapsulated the elements necessary for a swift, effective response to emergencies. Conclusion: The results indicate helicopter pilots’ non-technical skills vary according to mission parameters, suggesting specific flight goals require different nuances of non-technical skills for mission achievement. We suggest that non-technical skills training should be tailored to the mission focus of helicopter pilots in order to further error mitigation strategies, enrich training relevance, and enhance effectiveness. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Cognitive workload and psychophysiological parameters during multitask activity in helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Helicopter pilots are involved in a complex multitask activity, implying overuse of cognitive resources, which may result in piloting task impairment or in decision-making failure. Studies usually investigate this phenomenon in well-controlled, poorly ecological situations by focusing on the correlation between physiological values and either cognitive workload or emotional state. This study aimed at jointly exploring workload induced by a realistic simulated helicopter flight mission and emotional state, as well as physiological markers. Method: The experiment took place in the helicopter full flight dynamic simulator. Six participants had to fly on two missions. Workload level, skin conductance, RMS-EMG, and emotional state were assessed. Results: Joint analysis of psychological and physiological parameters associated with workload estimation revealed particular dynamics in each of three profiles. 1) Expert pilots showed a slight increase of measured physiological parameters associated with the increase in difficulty level. Workload estimates never reached the highest level and the emotional state for this profile only referred to positive emotions with low emotional intensity. 2) Non-Expert pilots showed increasing physiological values as the perceived workload increased. However, their emotional state referred to either positive or negative emotions, with a greater variability in emotional intensity. 3) Intermediate pilots were similar to Expert pilots regarding emotional states and similar to Non-Expert pilots regarding physiological patterns. Discussion: Overall, high interindividual variability of these results highlight the complex link between physiological and psychological parameters with workload, and question whether physiology alone could predict a pilot's inability to make the right decision at the right time. © 2015.

There were two subjects in a room, they could not be alone and it was difficult for them to have their own personal space and intimacy. In these circumstances, as in outer space, interpersonal relationships were of prime importance. This situation enabled us, through systematic observation, to analyze the evolution of the relational behavior in dyads, and to quote some social indicators of adaptation. Results show significant withdrawal, and the time spent alone was marked by the emergence, during the experiment, of specific preferential activities. Behavioral contagion was observed in each dyad (people engaged in the same activities at the same time), except in the one case of abandon. Moreover, the highest rates of inactivity and withdrawal were noted in this case. Verbal indicators were useful to comment these results and showed that, for all the dyads, one of the two subjects always played a regulating role by expressing a very positive perception of the situation.

However, psychomotor performance is difficult to assess. A battery of standardized and computerized tests, so-called ""Automated Portable Test System"" (APTS) was devised to ascertain the cognitive, perceptive and motor abilities and their possible fluctuations according to environmental effects. Antiorthostatic bedrest, often used to simulate weightlessness, (particularly cardiovascular modifications) also constitutes a situation of social confinement and isolation. During two bedrest experiments (with head-down tilt of -6°) of 28 days each, we intended to assess psychomotor performance of 6 males so as to determine whether: &#x02022; -on the one hand, it could be altered by remaining in decubitus; &#x02022; -on the other, the Lower Body Negative Pressure sessions, designed to prevent orthostatic intolerance back on Earth, could improve the performance. To accomplish this, part of the APTS tests as well as an automated perceptive attention test were performed. No downgrading of psychomotor performance was observed. On the contrary, the tasks were more accurately performed over time. In order to assess the experimental conditions on the acquisition phase, the learning curves were modelled.

METHODS: subjects completed the Balloon analog Risk task (BaRt) and two psychological scales once during the acclimation period, six times during the hDBR period, and twice during the recovery period.

RESULTS: the results demonstrated that subjects’ risk-taking behaviors were significantly affected by bed rest, with an increased propensity to engage in risky activities during the head-down stage. in addition, BaRt scores did not return to baseline when subjects entered the recovery stage. in terms of psychological variables, the results indicated that scores of general self-efficacy and recovery were negatively correlated with BaRt indicators, while stress levels were positively correlated with risky behaviors. compared to other psychological variables, the perceived physical stress, including fatigue, somatic complaints, and sleep quality, exhibited the strongest correlations with BaRt indicators.

Long-duration missions pose unique challenges and stressors, including separation from primary support group, monotonous environment, and loss of privacy and autonomy. Methods: The psychological services team, consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a master's level psychological support scientist, provided behavioral health services throughout all phases of the Flight Analogs Project (FAP) long-duration head-down bed rest study. During the initial screening phase, potential candidates completed 4 h of psychological testing and a 1.5-h clinical interview with a psychologist to assess their psychological fitness and ability to complete the study successfully. Additionally, the psychological services team provided pre-admission trainings on time management, stress management, and communication skills and conflict resolution. Throughout their stay on the research unit, study participants received regular individual and group visits from the psychological services team. Training was also provided to study personnel to address personality and behavioral management challenges.

This study sought to assess frequency of fl ying while acutely ill, identify clinical triggers in self-grounding, determine employer support for self-grounding, examine rates of infl uenza vaccination, and identify unmet needs for current information on ID issues related to extensive travel required of professional aircrews. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires were completed by select European mainline, U.S. regional airline, and professional corporate aircrews on ID topics such as fl ying while ill, fl ying with ill crewmembers, receipt of infl uenza vaccination, disinfection, and other aviation medical issues. Data were analyzed and reported as composite and stratifi ed by airline vs. corporate aviation respondents. Results: Aircrews often fl ew while ill (or with ill crewmembers); 52% fl ew until fever reached 38°C (100.4°F) and an additional 37% fl ew up to 38.89°C (102°F). Rate of annual infl uenza vaccination was quite low for all groups, but especially so for airline crews (21 - 27%), even given potential occupational exposure risk. Crews also had strongly differing perceptions of employer views on self-grounding, depending upon employment setting.

The oxygen mask model - which takes its name from flight attendants' directives to parents to put on their own oxygen mask before putting on their child's - says that parents should consider their own interests only insofar as doing so is, ultimately, good for the sick child. The wide interests model suggests that in doing well by my child I am at the very same time doing well by myself. My interests can, and plausibly do, encompass the interests of others; they are, to that extent, wide. There is, then, no sharp separation between the interests of the sick child and the interests of other family members. In the family interests model, families themselves are seen as having interests that are neither identical to the sum, nor a simple function, of the interests of individual family members. The family has goals, values, and aspirations that are essentially corporate rather than individual. According to this model, these family interests can explain why sacrifices can sometimes be demanded of some family members for the sake of others in a medical setting. Finally, the direct model takes a simpler view of family members' interests; it claims that these interests matter simply on their own and should be taken into account in making treatment decisions for a sick child. This model openly considers the competing interests that parents and other family members often have when caring for a sick child, and advocates for weighing those interests when making decisions for and about the sick child. While there is room for all four models at the bedside, I argue that the direct model should be highlighted in clinical decision-making. © © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</abstract>"", ""<title>Travel medicine: An Australian perspective</title> <abstract>Travel medicine is emerging as a new multidisciplinary specialty area catering for an increasing number of travellers worldwide.

External aids such as note-taking help pilots manage communication demands, and may especially benefit older pilots. Emerging technologies provide new opportunities for external aids that are integrated with other systems. We compared an electronic notepad (epad) positioned next to the instrument panel of a flight simulator to conventional note-taking (kneepad) on a read-back task. In Experiment 1, 6 older and 6 younger instrument-rated pilots listened to and read back ATC messages while using the epad, kneepad, or no aid. Epad use in this communication-only condition was compared to a condition in which pilots used the epad to support communication while flying the simulator. Read-back accuracy was higher when pilots used either aid compared to no aid, and the pattern of results suggested a smaller age difference with either aid than in the no-aid condition. Accuracy supported by the epad was not reduced in the multitask condition, suggesting the epad would support communication during flight. In Experiment 2, 12 younger and 12 older pilots performed the same tasks, with a modified epad interface. Further evidence was found for smaller age differences when communication was supported by either aid.

Participants accepted aircraft into sectors and detected aircraft conflicts during an air traffic control simulation. They were sometimes required to substitute new actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft traveling at certain speeds or altitudes, or with certain call signs. In Experiment 1, prospective memory error increased with intent to deviate from strong compared to weak routine, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to speed intentions. In addition, errors increased when intentions were general compared to specific. Participants also missed more conflicts when deviating from strong compared to weak routine. In Experiment 2, errors increased for intentions nonfocal to ongoing tasks compared to focal, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to call sign intentions. Participants were slower to accept aircraft when holding nonfocal compared to focal intentions, and slower to accept aircraft and detect conflicts when holding focal intentions compared to no intentions. These findings are consistent with theories that assume that individuals allocate limited-capacity attentional resources to prospective memory tasks. Increased error for altitude intentions, together with the effect of routine strength, suggest a vulnerability to error with increased strength of association between prospective memory cues and competing ongoing tasks. Ongoing tasks that focus attention on cues may sometimes impair, rather than benefit, intention retrieval. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>', '<title>Reducing prospective memory error and costs in simulated air traffic control: External aids, extending practice, and removing perceived memory requirements</title> <abstract>In air traffic control (ATC), forgetting to perform deferred actions-prospective memory (PM) errors- can have severe consequences.

We examined the extent to which PM errors and costs were reduced in simulated ATC by providing extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with instructions that removed perceived memory requirements. Participants accepted/handed-off aircraft and detected conflicts. For the PM task, participants were required to substitute alternative actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft. In Experiment 1, when no aids were provided, PM errors and costs were not reduced by practice. When aids were provided, costs observed early in practice were eliminated with practice, but residual PM errors remained. Experiment 2 provided more limited practice with aids, but instructions that did not frame the PM task as a ""memory"" task led to high PM accuracy without costs. Attention-allocation policies that participants set based on expected PM demands were modified as individuals were increasingly exposed to reliable aids, or were given instructions that removed perceived memory requirements.

The prospective memory task involved remembering to deviate from a routine operating procedure when accepting target aircraft. External aids that contained details of the prospective memory task appeared and flashed when target aircraft needed acceptance.

Background: English language proficiency requirements, standardized phraseology, and readbacks are some of the proactive measures which the aviation industry employs to ensure effective communication. However, despite these efforts, errors in communication still occur, and anecdotal evidence suggests that factors such as language background and phase of flight increase the likelihood of communication errors. Method: Eighteen hours of air-ground communications at Kingsford Smith International Airport, Sydney, Australia, were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that accented pilots committed more communication errors than native English sounding pilots and more specifically that these errors were mistakes rather than omissions, and involved words rather than numbers. Communication performance was similar in the approach and departure phases of flight regardless of language background. Conclusion: These results provide detailed information about the type of communication errors which occur in commercial aviation, their prevalence and the context in which they occur, which helps guide where resources should be directed to further improve safety. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Non-native English Communication and Anxiety in Military ATC: Insights from Korean Air Traffic Controllers</title> <abstract>This mixed-methods study investigated language anxiety among Korean military air traffic controllers (ATCOs) when communicating with native English-speaking pilots.

The qualitative phase (N = 13) employed semi-structured interviews exploring controllers' experiences, anxiety triggers, and coping mechanisms. Results revealed that general communication anxiety (β = .69, p < .001) and English proficiency (β = -.28, p < .05) significantly predicted anxiety with American pilots, with psychological factors explaining 58.8% of variance. These findings suggest that language anxiety stems from broader communication apprehension rather than isolated linguistic difficulties. Qualitative analysis identified five themes: communication breakdown, technical factors, skills hierarchy, informal coping, and institutional gaps.

Background: Aviation accident reports often cite miscommunication as a contributing factor. Anecdotal reports from pilots, along with limited empirical studies on pilot communication, further confirm that miscommunication remains a problem. Method: Approximately 250 ATC-Pilot transmissions from each of four international airports: Kingsford Smith, Sydney, Australia (YSSY); Hong Kong International Airport (VHHH); Los Angeles International Airport, USA (KLAX); and Haneda, Tokyo, Japan (RJTT) were analyzed. Pilot communication errors were compared between the four locations based on pilot and ATC accent alignment, rate of speech, number and order of items in transmission, and politeness markers. Results: Native English-sounding pilots committed more errors than accented pilots. Alignment of pilot and ATC language background reduced communication errors, but not when native English speakers were involved. Longer messages increased the number of communication errors. Politeness markers did not affect communication and pilots committed fewer errors when the readback order was not scrambled. Conclusion: Communication errors still occur in ATC-Pilot radio communication. These errors appear more common with native English sounding pilots than accented pilots. Hence, the origin of the problem appears to stem from proficiency in the lingua franca of Aviation English, rather than with the English language. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

Burnout of airline pilots has an extremely adverse impact on their physical and mental state, their work efficiency and safe operation of airlines, and is thus an important issue in occupational safety and health. Therefore, it is crucial to identify factors that may reduce burnout among airline pilots. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, the present study investigates the relationships between calling, psychological capital, organizational identification and burnout in order to understand the mechanisms underlying pilot burnout.

Correlation analysis, mediation analysis and moderated analysis were conducted. Results. The results showed that calling has a direct and negative effect on pilot burnout, and an indirect effect on burnout through influencing psychological capital. Moreover, organizational identification was found to positively moderate the negative relationship between calling and pilot burnout. Conclusion.

These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots. Method: A sample of 200 pilots completed validated self-report measures: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro. Results: Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = −0.46, p < 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p < 0.01. Conclusions: Resilience emerged as both a direct and indirect buffer against psychological strain in aviation. These findings underscore the importance of promoting adaptive coping and resilience training, alongside effective fatigue management, to enhance pilot well-being and maintain safety in aviation systems. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>Mediating Roles of Resilience and Stress in Emotion Regulation Strategies and Pilot Job Burnout</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pilot burnout significantly affects flight safety. Despite research on related factors, the intrinsic links between pilots’ emotion regulation and burnout are not thoroughly analyzed.

METHODS: T he study performed a path analysis on survey data from 106 Chinese civil aviation pilots to explore the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and job burnout. RESULTS: T he findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal affects job burnout through perceived stress and psychological resilience while expressive suppression impacts it via perceived stress. Family-work conflict and organizational stress significantly contribute to burnout, with the model showing a high fit (Comparative Fit Index = 0.99) and an R2 exceeding 0.5.

Despite the necessity, a validated and tailored measurement tool specific to this demographic is absent. Addressing this gap, this study built on the widely used CD-RISC-25 to analyze and modify its applicability to Chinese civil aviation pilots. Utilizing CD-RISC-25 survey data from 231 Chinese pilots, correlational and differential analyses identified items 3 and 20 as incongruent with this population's resilience profile. Subsequently, factor analysis derived a distinct two-factor resilience psychological framework labeled “Decisiveness” and “Adaptability”, which diverged from the structure found in American female pilots and the broader Chinese populace. Additionally, to further accurately identify the measurement characteristics of this 2-factor measurement model, this study introduced Generalized Theory and Item Response Theory, two modern measurement analysis theories, to comprehensively analyze the overall reliability of the measurement and issues with individual items. Results showed that the 2-factor model exhibited high reliability, with generalizability coefficient reaching 0.89503 and dependability coefficient reaching 0.88496, indicating the 2-factor measurement questionnaire can be effectively utilized for relative and absolute comparison of Chinese civil aviation pilot resilience. However, items in Factor 2 provided less information and have larger room for optimization than those in Factor 1, implying item option redesign may be beneficial. Consequently, this study culminates in the creation of a more accurate and reliable two-factor psychological resilience measurement tool tailored for Chinese civil aviation pilots, while exploring directions for optimization.

Background: Adversity in the workplace causes occupational stress, influencing resiliency, and reducing job performance and wellness. This can lead to burnout and attrition. Female pilots in male-dominated work environments experience adversity, resulting in occupational stress. Resilience may be a mitigating factor for coping with occupational stress. Women in male-dominated professions remain the extreme minority. Further, a severe pilot shortage magnifies the need to recruit and retain pilots from underrepresented groups. Method: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to validate the use of the CD-RISC for measuring resilience in female pilots. Inter- and intra-group resilience score comparisons of the 1,302 female pilots were analyzed. Results: An abridged version of the CD-RISC was found applicable to measuring resilience in female pilots. Age and work experience of the female pilots imply that they may influence higher resilience. A significantly lower resilience score was found in the sample in comparison to a national sample average resilience score. Conclusion: Female pilots’ resilience is likely influenced by workplace adversity, which may lead to increased occupation stress, greater attrition, and fewer pilot entrants. Interventions aimed at increasing the resiliency of female pilots are critical to solving the pilot shortage. The findings provide insight into the recruitment, retention, and development of women in male-dominated occupations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

In a pair of longitudinal studies, we used two waves of data from garment factory workers (Study 1 [T1: 2017, T2: 2019]: n = 344) and flight attendants (Study 2 [T1: 2017/2018, T2: 2020]: n = 1402) to examine the prospective associations of suffering with 16 outcomes across different domains of health and well-being: physical health, health behavior, mental health, psychological well-being, character strengths, and social well-being. The primary analysis involved a series of regression analyses in which each T2 outcome was regressed on overall suffering assessed at T1, adjusting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics and the baseline value (or close proxy) of the outcome assessed at T1. In Study 1, associations of overall suffering with worse subsequent health and well-being were limited to a single outcome on each of the domains of physical health and mental health. Overall suffering was more consistently related to worse subsequent health and well-being in Study 2, with associations emerging for all but two outcomes. The pattern of findings for each study was largely similar when aspects of suffering were modeled individually, although associations for some aspects of suffering differed from those that emerged for overall suffering.

Six job stressors were identified through a literature review and focus group interviews. To determine the causal relationships, a survey was conducted from February 8 to April 9, 2022, targeting Korean cabin crew members in Middle Eastern airlines. A total of 201 valid samples were used for the statistical analysis. The findings revealed that flight attendants' job stress negatively impacts their mental health, while mental health deterioration positively impacts service sabotage behavior. Job insecurity, vertical communication, and acculturation stress negatively impacts flight attendants' mental health. The findings indicate that mental health deterioration is important in mediating the relationship between job stress and service sabotage. Finally, it is confirmed that there are differences in job stress, mental health deterioration, and service sabotage based on various demographic and occupational characteristics. This study is noteworthy because it approaches the dependent variable of job stress from the perspective of employees’ mental health rather than job-related variables. Service sabotage is introduced as a new variable because this behavior by flight attendants, whose primary job is to interact with customers, can have serious consequences for airline organizations and customers alike. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"", '<title>The impact of workplace harassment on health in a working cohort</title> <abstract>Background: Workplace abuse, including sexual harassment, is frequently experienced worldwide and is related to adverse mental health outcomes, and injuries. Flight attendants are an understudied occupational group and are susceptible to harassment due to working in a feminized, client-facing occupation with few protections or sanctioned responses against aggressive behaviors. Objective: We investigated the relationship between workplace abuse and health in a cohort of cabin crew. We also aimed to characterize perpetrator profiles. Methods: We conducted our study among 4,459U.S. and Canada-based participants from the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study using multivariate logistic regression. Our exposures of interest were episodes of workplace abuse in the past year. We evaluated several mental and physical health outcomes, including depression, fatigue, musculoskeletal injuries, and general workplace injuries. Results: We report that exposures to verbal abuse, sexual harassment, and sexual assault are common among cabin crew, with 63, 26, and 2% of respondents, respectively, reporting harassment in the past year alone. Workplace abuse was associated with depression, sleep disturbances, and musculoskeletal injuries among male and female crew, with a trend toward increasing odds ratios (ORs) given a higher frequency of events. For example, sexual harassment was related to an increased odds for depression (OR = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-2.30), which increased in a dose response-like manner among women reporting harassment once (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.93-1.95), 2-3 times (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.29-2.38), and 4 or more times (OR = 4.12, 95% CI: 3.18-5.06). We found that passengers were the primary perpetrators of abuse. Conclusions: Our study is the first to comprehensively characterize workplace abuse and harassment and its relation to health in a largely female customer-facing workforce. The strong associations with health outcomes observed in our study highlights the question of how workplace policies can be altered to mitigate prevalent abuses. Clinicians could also consider how jobs with high emotional labor demands may predispose people to adverse health outcomes, educate patients regarding their psychological/physical responses and coping strategies, and be aware of signs of distress in patients working in such occupations in order to direct them to the appropriate treatments and therapies. © 2019 Gale, Mordukhovich, Newlan and McNeely.</abstract>', '<title>Self perceived health and mental health among women flight attendants</title> <abstract>Aims: The authors investigated associations of work related risk factors with self perceived health as less than ""good"" and psychological distress among Italian women flight attendants. Methods: The authors conducted a cross sectional survey on health and mental health among 1955 former and current flight attendants, using a postal questionnaire. Results: More current than former flight attendants reported self perceived health as fair to poor and psychological distress measured as a GHQ-12 score of six or more. Among current flight attendants, reporting health as fair to poor was associated with low job satisfaction (OR 1.89) and recent experiences of sexual harassment by passengers (OR 2.83). Psychological distress was associated with low job satisfaction (OR 2.38) and frequent tension with partner over childcare (OR 1.79). Conclusions: Perceived health as fair to poor and psychological distress were greater among current flight attendants and were related to job characteristics and family difficulties. Perceived poor health has been shown in the literature to be related to mortality, high job strain, and early retirement, and psychological distress is associated with work absence. The effect of sexual harassment by passengers on perceived health of flight attendants may be relevant to other working women dealing with the public. The health effects of family/work conflicts, low job satisfaction, and sexual harassment should be explored more in depth, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods among working women in various occupations.</abstract>']"

The subjects were eight pilots who participated on a volunteer basis. Samples of urine were collected ∼30 minutes before (preflight) and 20 minutes after (postflight) the flights. The ratios (post-:preflight) of noradrenaline levels were 1.20 ± 0.09 (Japan-Alaska) and 1.32 ± 0.12 (Alaska-Japan), and those of adrenaline were 4.03 ± 1.06 and 3.68 ± 0.98.

Flight cadets were divided into passed and failed cadets. Fighter pilots were divided into superior, above average, and average with flying ratings of >7, 6-7, and <6, respectively, and with flying experience of 2050 ± 1081 h, 884 ± 575 h, and 616 ± 756 h, respectively. CA excretion data showed significant intra- and intergroup differences. Excretion rates for CA and NE before and after flight were significantly higher in flight cadets than in fighter pilots. After flight, all the preflight urinary variables increased significantly in passed flight cadets, while changes in failed flight cadets were not significant. In all groups of fighter pilots, preflight excretion rates for CA, E, and NE rose postflight, but the differences within the groups were not significant. The NE/E ratio decreased significantly as a function of flight adaptation. The pre- and postflight NE/E ratios were lower in fighter pilots than in flight cadets. The ΔNE/E ratio decreased in fighter pilots, but increased in flight cadets. The preflight NE/E ratio was smaller for superior than for above average and average fighter pilots, and for passed than for failed flight cadets. The postflight NE/E ratio did not show any significant differences within the groups. In superior fighter pilots, the ΔNE/E ratio remained relatively stable, while it was reduced in above average and average fighter pilots. An unchanged or a reduced ΔNE/E ratio can be regarded as rapid adaptation of sympathoadrenal activity to flying stress. In passed flight cadets, ΔNE/E ratio rose, indicating a flight-induced sympathoadrenal stimulation. This can be interpreted as a prerequisite for flight adaptation during initial phase of flight training. On the contrary, failed flight cadets exhibited a higher preflight NE/E ratio which showed a postflight reduction. This can occur because of overstimulation and reduced responsiveness of sympathoadrenal activity before and during flight, respectively. These changes may represent a neuroendocrine response which might represent a failure to adapt.</abstract>', '<title>Salivary alpha-amylase activity and stress in Japan air self-defense force cargo pilots involved in Iraq reconstruction</title> <abstract>Objectives: This study aimed to verify whether salivary α-amylase enzyme activity (Amy) is useful as a biomarker of stress in pilots working in a stressful environment. Methods: The subjects in this study were nine Japan air self-defense force pilots who participated in Iraq reconstruction support activity in Kuwait. Amy was measured using a portable salivary amylase monitor at preflight, postflight, and on stand-by day. In addition, the state-trait anxiety inventory was administered with state scores (STAI-S) compared to Amy levels. Results: There were greater differences in Amy levels at baseline compared to STAI-S scores between subjects on the stand-by day. Amy levels at preflight tended to increase compared to those on stand-by day as did STAI-S. The change in Amy level at postflight varied among the pilots. The Amy levels of four subjects at postflight were elevated compared to levels at preflight, while the STAI-S scores for all pilots at postflight were lower than at preflight. Conclusions: This study suggests that the Amy level of pilots can reflect subtle individual differences in response to the psychological and physiological stress of a flight task. Thus, monitoring Amy level may be useful for stress evaluation of pilots working in a stressful environment, providing data that might be used as an impetus for addressing stress management for this population. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract>', '<title>Effects of flight workload on urinary catecholamine responses in experienced military pilots</title> <abstract>Summary.-This study investigated the flight responses induced by strenuous acrobatic demonstration flight and an air-to-air combat maneuvering flight in experienced pilots.

Samples of urine were collected approximately 30 min. before and 20 min. after the flights. The postflight adrenaline in all pilots was significantly higher than at preflight, while a significant increase in noradrenaline at postflight was not observed. The post-/preflight ratio of adrenaline in all pilots was relatively similar and high.

Objectives: The study analyzes how the Chinese public's concerns, emotional responses, attributions, and attitudes toward air travel change following aviation accidents with varying severity and social impact. Additionally, it extends the application of the emotion-social information model in disaster scenarios and online behavior, providing valuable insights for crisis management.

Comments before and after the incidents were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank tests to assess changes in attitudes toward air travel. Results: Public attention focused on victims, causes, and crew responses. Severe accidents elicited sadness, while less severe incidents prompted disgust and fear. Positive societal impacts from accidents improved emotions but did not significantly affect travel attitudes. Negative emotions led to a notable shift in attitudes toward air travel, while positive emotions had a limited effect.

It is as much a threat to the viability of online social networks for youth today as spam once was to email in the early days of the Internet. Current work to tackle this problem has involved social and psychological studies on its prevalence as well as its negative effects on adolescents. While true solutions rest on teaching youth to have healthy personal relationships, few have considered innovative design of social network software as a tool for mitigating this problem. Mitigating cyberbullying involves two key components: robust techniques for effective detection and reflective user interfaces that encourage users to reflect upon their behavior and their choices. Spam filters have been successful by applying statistical approaches like Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. They can, like Googles GMail, aggregate human spam judgments because spam is sent nearly identically to many people. Bullying is more personalized, varied, and contextual. In this work, we present an approach for bullying detection based on state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense knowledge base, which permits recognition over a broad spectrum of topics in everyday life. We analyze a more narrow range of particular subject matter associated with bullying (e.g. appearance, intelligence, racial and ethnic slurs, social acceptance, and rejection), and construct BullySpace, a common sense knowledge base that encodes particular knowledge about bullying situations. We then perform joint reasoning with common sense knowledge about a wide range of everyday life topics. We analyze messages using our novel AnalogySpace common sense reasoning technique. We also take into account social network analysis and other factors. We evaluate the model on real-world instances that have been reported by users on Formspring, a social networking website that is popular with teenagers. On the intervention side, we explore a set of reflective user-interaction paradigms with the goal of promoting empathy among social network participants. We propose an ""air traffic control""-like dashboard, which alerts moderators to large-scale outbreaks that appear to be escalating or spreading and helps them prioritize the current deluge of user complaints. For potential victims, we provide educational material that informs them about how to cope with the situation, and connects them with emotional support from others.

Background: In air combat, evaluations of team performance have focused on task performance. However, both teamwork and taskwork are required for high performance output. Attempts to address taskwork and teamwork in single-seat fighter aircraft flights have mainly settled for adopting existing models of teamwork to flights. As such, they have overlooked the unique nature of teamwork in air combat. Method: Existing models of teamwork and taskwork are reviewed and a flight’s tactical decision-making is described as an input-process-output model. A model combining flight’s teamwork, taskwork, situation awareness and transactive memory is conceptualized and operation of the model is illustrated with a case study. In the case study, the model is used to provide an alternative explanation for an air combat accident. Results: The model bridges the gap between the well-established concepts of teamwork and the unique nature of air combat. It rationalizes how the mission essential competencies, situation awareness and transactive memory interact with each other, and how they impact the flight’s performance output.

These factors can be included in determination of individual candidates as being 'fully qualified,' rather than returning to the original 'best qualified' standards, and affirmative qualities may be identified which mark candidates as 'exceptionally well qualified.'

After national preselection, 59 applicants underwent the psychological evaluation, which consisted of the assessment of operational aptitudes (basic cognitive and psychomotor functions) and personality traits (motivation, social capability, stress resistance). The test program included a diverse number of tests, questionnaires, behavioral ratings, biographical data, and semi-structured interviews. About 50 scores were available for each subject.

The final stage involved 10 of 963 applicants undergoing the first and second examination stages based on physical checks, written tests, and interviews. The third (final) stage focused on evaluating the behavioral attitudes required for ISS crewmembers. Since it is difficult to assess these attitudes by paper testing or interview alone, JAXA has established an environment in which the assessors could observe the behavior of examinees on a continuous basis. Methods: The 10 examinees stayed in the isolation and confinement facility for 1 wk. During their stay, several group and personal tasks were assigned along with predetermined daily schedules covering aspects of leadership, teamwork ability, productivity (performance), and so on. Subsequently, psychologists, psychiatrists, and JAXA officials/managers experienced in practical human space development evaluated them. Results: During the confinement, no examinees showed any excessive character traits or psychopathologic behavior. Repeated observations led to a convergence of opinions among the experts. Three examinees ultimately passed this assessment and were assigned as new Japanese astronaut candidates. Discussion: This unique assessment enabled the assessors to conduct longitudinal evaluations, evaluations based on observing detailed behavior, and easy control of test conditions and safety.

Based on a task analysis of ATM and backed up by the stress-strain model, an easy-to-interpret triangle was constructed and validated both in simulated and real ATM workplaces. Results from the validation studies show that TEST does not only reflect the most relevant task characteristics, but also provides additional insights in the controllers' working styles. The TEST tool can make ATM safety surveys more efficient and help supervisors to decide about optimal times for opening or closing additional sectors. Statement of Relevance: TEST is a new tool to assess taskload, efficiency and safety-buffers in a joint scaling.

Expert observers rated the degree of activity and behavioural arousal of ATCs working the 47 radar sectors at the same time the objective measures were made. These ‘pace’ ratings were signficantly related to peak traffic count and duration of radio-communications. The control load factors were not related to behavioural responses. Statistical analyses indicated several refinements for the definition and measurement of the control load factors. For example, airspace control load was reliably estimated by sector type and number of transitioning planes, while co-ordination control load was most appropriately estimated by duration of radio-communications ' These results suggested that estimations of workload may be made by a relatively few objective measures, and that at least one estimate of individual’s behavioural responses, i.e. pace ratings, can be predicted by peak traffic counts. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"", '<title>Mental Workload in Air Traffic Control: An Index Constructed from Field Tests</title> <abstract>Background: Mental workload assessment is a recurrent issue in air traffic control (ATC). Studies of ATC have used either objective aspects, i.e., numbers and distribution of aircraft, or subjective factors, such as self-imposed performance and stress levels, with mixed results. This is partly due to the difficulty in bringing together comparable data pertaining to both air traffic, with its ever-changing distribution, and judgement or quickly fluctuating psychophysiological variables. Methods: We propose a method of mental load estimation devised to take into account both objective traffic variables and the additional load imposed by subjective effects, including the seriousness of conflicts and the time-pressure for their resolution. First, we developed a traffic load index (TLI) to identify time boundaries during which additional load may occur. Then we quantified the additional load according to the air traffic situation. Results: TLI was developed from analysis of 25 h of recordings of radar control sessions involving 25 professional air traffic controllers at a major airport. Results were then compared with a simple objective index (number of aircraft) and subjective workload ratings (NASA-TLX test). The whole population (intersubjects analysis) showed a better correlation between the TLI and the self-rated workload than for the number of aircraft alone. Among the controllers who rated more than one level of workload through the TLX-test, 77.8% showed better correlation between TLI and TLX than between N and TLX (intrasubjects analysis).

We report a new algorithm for computing weights from qualitative fuzzy integrals and apply it to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -Task Load indeX (NASA-TLX) subscales in order to replace the standard pair-wise weighting technique (PWT). In this paper, two empirical studies were reported: (1) In a laboratory experiment, age- and task-related variables were investigated in 53 male volunteers and (2) In a field study, task- and job-related variables were studied on aircrews during 48 commercial flights. The results found in this study were as follows: (i) in the experimental setting, fuzzy estimates were highly correlated with classical (using PWT) estimates; (ii) in real work conditions, replacing PWT by automated fuzzy treatments simplified the NASA-TLX completion; (iii) the algorithm for computing fuzzy estimates provides a new classification procedure sensitive to various variables of work environments and (iv) subjective and objective measures can be used for the fuzzy aggregation of NASA-TLX subscales. Practitioner Summary: NASA-TLX, a classical tool for mental workload assessment, is based on a weighted sum of ratings from six subscales.

Background: In affective experience studies, people’s evaluation of a period of experience is strongly influenced by the most intense (peak) point and the endpoint. However, whether the effects exist in mental workload evaluations made by professional operators is still not known. Method: In Study 1, 20 ATCos performed air traffic control scenarios on high-fidelity radar simulators and reported their mental workload. We used a 2 (high peak, low peak) × 2 (high end, low end) within-subject design. In Study 2, another group of 43 ATCos completed a survey asking them to predict their mental workload given the same air traffic control scenarios. Results: In Study 1, ATCos reported higher mental workload after completing the high-peak and the high-end scenarios. In contrast, in Study 2, ATCos predicted the peak workload effect but not the end workload effect when asked to predict their experience in dealing with the same scenarios. Conclusion: Peak and end effects exist in subjective mental workload evaluation, but experts only had meta-cognitive awareness of the peak effect, and not the end effect. Application: Researchers and practitioners that use subjective workload estimates for work design decisions need to be aware of the potential impact of peak and end task demand effects on subjective mental workload ratings provided by expert operators. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>']"

Clinical Observations: Although ejection in a hostile environment is an exceptional event, it is what flight crews fear most strongly over enemy territory. Since the widespread use of ejection seats in fighter aircraft in the 1950s, ejection has become a means of protecting the crews ' lives. Ejection is a breaking point when the pilot suddenly passes from an intense activity to a passive position in which he (or she) is often helpless and sometimes exposed to the hostility of the environment where he lands. It is always important to analyze the circumstances surrounding an ejection. Some clinical observations allow us to understand the psycho-traumatic potential of this brutal experience. In a hostile environment, ejection quite rapidly becomes a question of survival. Discussion: The pilot is technically and physically prepared during training. He (or she) regularly trains for the use of the ejection seat and the equipment to protect himself, to report, and ensure his survival until his recovery. Because it is always a singular event, on a case-by-case basis, no psychological reaction to such a situation can be modeled with a view to predicting psycho-traumatic disorders.

Such information can assist in designing realistic indoctrination and training programs. This study was conducted to fill gaps in our understanding of aircrew perspectives of successful ejections. Methods: Aircrew reporting to the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), Indian Air Force, for post-ejection evaluation during the period of May 2003 to January 2005 completed a questionnaire that was designed for the study. Results: A total of 20 aircrew completed this questionnaire. The mean age of the aircrew was 30.25 ± 4.45 yr. Most of them had logged more than 500 flying hours. Some aircrew described their initial moments of ejection as ""blacked out,"" ""dazed, yet conscious,"" or as ""a shock that gradually decreased."" Practicing ejection drills on the ground, being prepared at all times, making a timely decision to eject, and assuming correct posture were identified as the most important factors for success. Descriptions of ejection as an event suggest intense emotional arousal could occur following ejection.

Selection of causal factors is often distorted by rumors and inaccurate teaching concerning how specific types of injuries occur and/or the consequences of using specific types of Aircrew Automated Escape Systems (AAES) and Aircrew Life Support Systems (ALSS) equipment. Unfortunately, aiding and abetting the selection of incorrect causal factors is the 'strength-in-numbers'-type legitimacy that many of these factors have acquired through frequent usage over the years. Thus, if one should query the Naval Safety Center computer concerning either 1) how many ejectees under certain conditions and/or using specific AAES/ALSS equipment sustained specific injuries, or 2) how many ejectee received a specific type of injury caused by a specific factor, that computer will obligingly and non-critically provide numbers. Because those numbers are generated by a computer, they gain an overwhelming appearance of irrefutability in demonstrating the correctness of any assessment that conforms. Careful, detailed investigation (and also general statistical investigation), however, often has revealed that these accepted causal factors either cannot be applicable or are of extremely doubtful applicability for the specific situations. This paper discusses some of the recent results of investigating many of the accepted causal factors and some methodologies that might aid an investigator in determining the causal factors.

They were both successfully rescued and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. In this study, we investigate their ejection injuries and recovery process. CASE SUMMARY We analyzed the clinical data of the traumatic condition and recovery process from ejection injuries of two pilots who ejected from a failed trainer jet and survived. After being successfully rescued and sent to the hospital, they were diagnosed with multiple ejection injuries, including eye trauma, limb bone and joint injury, rib and spine injury, and so on. Both cases underwent fluid replacement, acid suppression, nutritional support, hemostasis, bone metabolism improvement, phlegm elimination, psychological measurement, blood circulation promotion and detumescence, physical therapy, and external fixation with braces for 1 mo before being discharged from hospital. They then recuperated in a sanatorium for 2 mo, and the related laboratory tests and supplementary examinations show that they recovered from all the above injuries. After successfully passing the psychological test and physical examination, they returned to flight duty 3 mo after ejection. CONCLUSION The causes and conditions of ejection injury in the pilots were very complex. Although they finally recovered quickly and were released, it also serves as a reminder that attention should be paid to pilots’ ejection and parachute training in order to significantly reduce ejection injury and improve the ejection success rate. In addition, air defense support personnel should strengthen search and rescue and on-site emergency measures, and locate and rescue pilots in distress as early as possible to reduce subsequent injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.

A cross-sectional survey was used to determine the self-reported 1-yr prevalence of neck pain and to compare individual, work-related, and flight-related characteristics in F-16 pilots with and without neck pain. Method: There were 90 male F-16 pilots of the Belgian Air Force and The Royal Netherlands Air Force who voluntarily completed an anonymous survey. Resorts: The 1-yr prevalence of neck pain was 18.9%. Pilots were divided into two groups: healthy (HG) and neck pain group (NPG). This study could not identify individual or specific flight-related differences between these two groups. High force demands, often sitting for a long time, frequently holding the neck in a forward bent posture, and being physically tired were all physical work-related factors that were reported significantly more often in the NPG. The NPG also reported significantly more psychosocial factors, such as being mentally tired at the end of the day and being annoyed by others at the workplace. Discussion: Since the specific flight-related factors were not significantly different between the HG and the NPG, physical and psychosocial factors could have been important factors in the development or maintenance of neck pain in F-16 pilots. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight for the first time that, in addition to flight-related issues, other aspects must be considered in analyzing neck pain.

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and degree of the pain intensity in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, subjective risk factors and their effect on the pilots' performance while flying high maneuver aircrafts and the consequences for cognitive deficiencies. Material and Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective, anonymous questionnaire survey, collecting data on the age, aircraft type, flying hours, pain characteristics, physical activity, etc. The study was participated by 94 pilots aged 28-45 years (mean age: 35.9±3.3 years), actively flying fast jet aircrafts Su-22, Mig-29 and F-16. The estimates regarding the level of the subjective back pain were established using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: The values of the Cochran and Cox T-test for heterogeneous variances are as follows: for the total number of flying hours: F = 2.53, p = 0.0145, for the pilot's age: F = 3.15, p = 0.003, and for the BMI factor F = 2.73, p = 0.008.

Despite the high prevalence of neck pain and growing operational demands, there remains no consensus regarding best practices for mitigating aircrew pain and injury. Although most pilot training locations have established aircrew performance teams, only select locations have mandated training hours to support injury mitigation training. Eglin Air Force Base (EAFB) F-35A student pilots (SPs) engage in a mandatory 8-week standardized spine training program (STP). In contrast, the F-15E Flying Course at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (SJAFB) does not have syllabus hours to support the STP, resulting in the capability to utilize this site as a comparison group for this analysis. The primary objective of this study was to determine if completion of the STP led to significant differences in the Cervical Endurance Hold (CEH). We hypothesized that SPs would exhibit significant training adaptations only if they had dedicated training hours that could support the completion of the STP. Materials and Methods: SPs from EAFB who were actively enrolled in the F-35A Flying Course from 2022 to 2024 participated in an 8-week STP. The CEH test was administered before the start of the Flying Course (pre-flying training), after the 8-week STP intervention (post-8 week), after the air-to-air phase of training (post air-to-air), and after the completion of the Flying Course (post-flying training). SPs from SJAFB who were actively enrolled in the F-15E Flying Course from 2022 to 2024 did not participate in the standardized STP. The CEH test was administered before the Flying Course (pre-flying training) and following the completion of the Flying Course (post-flying training). JMP 16.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) was used to retrospectively analyze the data from this study. Results: There was a significant effect from the STP between the intervention (EAFB) and comparison (SJAFB) groups (F(1,81.28) = 7.456; P = .008). Additionally, the STP had a significantly positive effect on CEH time, following the initial 8-week intervention (pre-training = 96.28s ± (37.95s), 8-week = 132.81 seconds ± (30.96s) P < .001), which was maintained throughout the duration of the Flying Course (pre-training = 96.28s ± (37.95s), post-training = 117.34s ± (29.73s) P = .013). Conclusions: The study results show a significant improvement in CEH outcomes after the 8-week STP intervention, which was not seen at the comparison site. Notably, the benefits of the STP at the intervention site were sustained even after the Flying Course was completed, indicating that the program may have a sustained protective effect. Future analysis of flight profiles between locations that implement the STP and those that do not should be conducted. This comparison could help determine whether the STP is contributing to a reduction in duty limitations.

When considering all participants collectively, there was a notable 33.6% increase in CEH from intake to exit (P < 0.001) with an overall effect size of d = 1.14. When analyzing specific subgroups, females from Luke AFB experienced a significant 20.4% increase in CEH (P < 0.001, d = 1.14), males from Luke AFB exhibited a significant 34.5% increase (P < 0.001, d = 1.09), and males from Eglin AFB demonstrated a significant increase of 55.7% in CEH (P < 0.001, d = 1.97). Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed significant improvements in the CEH across all groups following the completion of the STP. Furthermore, CEH results from both bases exhibited a large effect size indicating a meaningful change was found between intake and exit regardless of training location. These preliminary study results should be interpreted with caution as a control group was unable to be established. In the future, a randomized control trial should be performed to test the STP used in this study against other STP programs.

The Aircrew Conditioning Programme and direct access physiotherapy exist to minimise the impact on military capability, but a population specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) is required to investigate the effectiveness of these. We aimed to explore the experiences of flight-related neck pain to inform the content validity and development of a population specific PROM. Methods Qualitative semistructured interviews combining phenomenological and grounded theory methods, reported using Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines. A purposive sample of 10 fast jet pilots with neck pain was recruited. Concept elicitation interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim along with field notes. Data analysis involved subject and methodological expertise used a concept elicitation approach. Results Participants included 10 male fast jet pilots, age 34.7 years. Identified themes included: (1) physical symptoms associated with flying activities; (2) occupational effects revealed modifications of flying, or suboptimal' performance owing to neck pain; (3) psychological effects revealed feelings or worry and (4) social and activity effects showed impact on out of work time. Conclusion Population-specific occupational, psychological and social factors should be considered alongside physical symptoms when managing neck pain in military aircrew.

One possible explanation for the failure to find stronger relationships may be due to the lack of appropriate taxonomies for both personality constructs and for performance constructs. The present research was designed to examine the relationship between personality and combat performance using the 'Big Five' model of personality and a multi-component model of pilot combat performance. A sample of 100 USAF pilots rated the importance of 60 traits for effective performance on performance dimensions such as flying skills and crew management. The results indicated that pilots from different aircraft agreed that the personality trait of Conscientiousness was the most important determinant of performance on all performance dimensions.

Although a great deal of effort within the aviation community has been focused on ensuring technical expertise, and new efforts highlight attitudes associated with crew coordination, personality factors have been relatively unexplored. Further, it is argued that past failures to find linkages between personality and performance were due to a combination of inadequate statistical modeling, premature performance evaluation, and/or the reliance on data gathered in contrived as opposed to realistic situations. The goal of the research presented in this article is to isolate subgroups of pilots along performance-related personality dimensions and to document limits on the impact of crew coordination training between the groups.

While prior studies have focused on the Big Five and HEXACO models in ethical decision-making, empirical applications of the Eysenck framework to honesty prediction remain scarce-particularly in aviation, where dishonest acts (e.g., underreporting safety incidents) carry severe public safety consequences. Methods: We collected behavioral data from 102 flight and air traffic control cadets using a coin-toss task. Explainable machine learning (XGBoost) was employed to model nonlinear relationships between personality, gender, and honesty. Model performance was evaluated via AUC, with SHAP analysis identifying key predictors. Results: XGBoost achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.802). SHAP analysis revealed: (1) neuroticism as the strongest predictor of dishonesty; (2) significant gender differences (higher dishonesty rates in males); and (3) threshold effects for Psychoticism and Extraversion. Discussion: This work makes three key contributions: (1) first systematic application of the Eysenck model to aviation honesty prediction; (2) identification of gender as a critical moderating variable; and (3) development of a SHAP-driven interpretable framework that connects machine learning outputs with psychological theory. Practically, these findings enable data-driven screening of cadets' honesty tendencies during recruitment, facilitating targeted interventions for safer aviation operations. © © 2025 Meng, Peng, Zhang, Chen, Huang, Chen and Zhao.</abstract>"", ""<title>A study on the student pilot's mental workload due to personality types of both instructor and student</title> <abstract>The main purpose of this paper is to provide the ideal flight crew combination for instructor and student pilots in order to enhance the flight training effects based on Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) theory. In addition to personality, various levels of flight difficulty are considered in order to investigate their potential interaction effect in terms of student pilots' mental workload measured in heart rate, altitude deviation, NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) and subjective degree of personality harmony.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted of all active crew members (nurses, respiratory therapists and pilots) in a hospital-based flight program. Data collected included the results of the MBTI, gender, age and years of flight experience. Results: Crew members were represented by 14 of 16 possible MBTI personality types, with three types predominating. For each crew specialty, extroversion preferences predominated over introversion, and perceiving characteristics predominated over judging characteristics. Differences existed by crew specialty for the sensing-intuition and thinking-feeling dimensions.

Also, some pilots will sustain head injuries that will affect their flying careers. The complex and unforgiving nature of aviation demands a conservative approach to occupational return after neurological insult. Therefore, a neuropsychological assessment is required to return to flying. The lack of pre-injury neuropsychological data, however, hinders accurate assessment of post-injury functioning. Hypotheses: a) Psychological data may improve the pilot selection and assignment processes as military resources dwindle; and b) baseline intellectual/cognitive data may support the scientific basis of aeromedical decision-making. Methods: Neuropsychiatrically Enhanced Flight Screening (N-EFS) attempts to validate the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB), CogScreen, Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PI-R), and Personal Characteristics Inventory (PCI) for pilot selection and cockpit assignment. N-EFS also measures baseline intelligence (using the MAB) and cognitive functioning (using the CogScreen) for comparison purposes if a future medical flying waiver is needed after neurological insult. These assessments will compare the aviator's postinjury functioning to a personal intellectual functioning baseline captured at entry into aviation training. Results: N-EFS students are scoring from below average to very superior in intellectual assessment. Very preliminary personality testing results suggest few significant differences between male and female student pilots, with high extraversion being the most striking personality characteristic.

However, subtle but safety-significant post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments may go unreported or undetected. The Trail Making Test (TMT) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) can detect these impairments in domains essential to pilot performance, though further investigation is needed to assess their effectiveness and clinical utility in routine pilot aeromedical examinations. This short communication presents preliminary findings for using these tests. METHODS: A study identified the TMT and SDMT as appropriate screening tools for evaluating pilot neurocognitive performance after COVID-19. Mixed methods were then used to compare the screening tools' performance between post-COVID-19 cases and healthy controls, while also assessing their acceptability and feasibility in routine aeromedical examinations for pilots. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 neurocognitive disorders affect skills that are essential for pilot performance. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tests, with area under the curve values of 0.853 for TMT Part B, 0.817 for the SDC version of SDMT, and 0.769 for TMT Part A, indicating their effectiveness in identifying cognitive impairments. Airline pilots considered screening an important flight safety intervention. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots, together with international aviation psychologists and aviation medicine experts, endorsed the safety-critical importance and value of screening pilots for post-COVID-19 impairments. Given the numerous practical implications of implementing such a strategy, we recommend that pilots be screened for potential post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments.

A sufficiently sensitive screening test of cognitive function, based on the typical cognitive effects of COVID-19 and skills considered most relevant to pilot performance, would be highly beneficial to be used alongside other performance checks. This study aimed to identify appropriate screening tests for post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: I nitially, a systematic search and narrative review identified 13 screening tools that are likely to be effective in screening pilots for post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairment. Following a more in-depth evaluation of the identified tools, five tests including the Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Color Word Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were chosen for a Delphi evaluation exercise. A two-round modified Delphi process was undertaken with international aviation medicine and psychology experts to obtain a consensus on which of the identified tests would be appropriate to screen for cognitive dysfunction in pilots. RESULTS: Based on evaluation of literature review findings and Delphi consultation with subject matter experts, the Trail Making Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were identified as quick and suitable screening tests likely to detect post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction.

Efforts to effectively screen aviators for these disorders are continually sought, as under-diagnosis may negatively impact aviation safety. This study evaluates screening tools that have been validated in non-aviators in terms of their utility for aviator patients. Methods: There were 111 male aviation patients (27 ± 7 yr) referred for psychiatric evaluation at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute who completed the Self-Administered Alcohol Screening Test (SAAST), the Alcohol-Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Common Alcohol Logistical Scale-Revised (CAL-R) prior to evaluation by a staff psychiatrist or psychologist. Results: There were 40 patients who were qualified psychiatrically with no diagnosis and 49 patients who were disqualified for psychiatric reasons due to a non alcohol-related diagnosis. The remaining 22 patients were disqualified for psychiatric reasons with an alcohol-related diagnosis. The optimal aviator cut-off scores were consistent with those of the general population, although the cut-off score used for the SAAST was set at the published sub-threshold level to provide greater sensitivity. The sensitivity/specificity values for the SAAST, AUDIT, and CAL-R were 59%/94%, 46%/96%, and 68%/81%, respectively. Conclusion: The psychometrically sophisticated CAL-R is sensitive, specific, and has good negative predictive value, although its use requires a psychologist and its availability is limited. The SAAST and AUDIT can be administered by a flight surgeon or aviation medical examiner (AME). Given the higher sensitivity of the SAAST it may be the most beneficial if administered first. The AUDIT can be used as a follow-up diagnostic test given its higher specificity. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>']"

The putative mechanism for this increase in safety is that previously demonstrated improvements in lateral and vertical control of the aircraft in flight should carry over to the landing situation. Alternatively, it is possible that, during approach and landing, the HUD might affect the pilot's ability to assimilate outside cues at the decision height, thereby reducing the success ratio for landings using an HUD. This article reports a pair of experiments that test these competing hypotheses. Taking advantage of the opportunity when an air transport operator introduced HUD in an existing aircraft fleet, we were able to use a Boeing 737-700 full-motion simulator flown by commercial airline pilots. We explored the effects of (a) HUD use, (b) ambient visibility, and (c) length of approach lighting on the size and location of the touchdown footprint. We also explored the effects of HUD use on approach success ratio. HUD use reduced the width of the touchdown footprint in all tested visibility and lighting conditions, including visibility below the minimum allowed. HUD use had no effect on the length of the touchdown footprint. We could not detect any decrease in approach success rate for HUD approaches. Based on these empirical data, the minimum visibility for approaches using HUDs could be set lower than for approaches without an HUD.

Several tunnel-in-the-sky and pathway-in-the-sky concepts including scene-linking elements have been evaluated. Pathway-in-the-sky displays enable pilots to accurately fly difficult trajectories. However, these displays may drive pilots' attention to the aircraft guidance task at the expense of other tasks, particularly when the pathway display is located head-down. A pathway head-up display (HUD) might be a viable solution to overcome this disadvantage. Moreover, the pathway might mitigate the perceptual segregation between the static near domain and the dynamic far domain and hence might improve attention switching between both sources. To more comprehensively overcome the perceptual near-to-far domain disconnect, alphanumeric symbols could be attached to the pathway leading to an HUD design concept called scene linking. A scene-linked pathway-predictor concept was implemented on a monocular retinal scanning head-mounted device (HMD) in combination with an optical head tracker. The evaluation comprises low-fidelity part-task simulations, high-fidelity simulator runs, and flight trials. Where laboratory experiments found evidence in favor of scene-linked pathway HUDs or HMDs, the real flight tests could not fully support this display concept.

Participants completed temporal production, verbal estimation, and passage of time judgments, while actively engaging in real flight control sessions. Subjective assessments of task demands, as well as physiological responses (cardiac and electrodermal activity) were also measured. Accuracy of the produced intervals was measured at two distinct phases of the flight (during low-load cruising vs. high-load landing) and under two different task load manipulations (controlling one vs. two helicopters and speaking in native vs. non-native language). Analysis of interval production accuracy showed that during the high-load landing phase significant overproductions were made, compared to the low-load cruising phase, and landing two helicopters led to greater overproductions compared to landing only one. The duration of the two-helicopter sessions was significantly overestimated compared to the single-helicopter ones, and the passage of time was felt significantly faster. Subjective assessments of workload were positively correlated with the temporal estimations and passage of time judgments, and skin responses were positively correlated with the produced intervals.

This is a continual challenge as aerospace technology leaps ahead while the human factor remains relatively constant. However, several issues interfere with the smooth interaction between these communities: 1) perceptions that the research and operational communities have towards human subjects and pilots respectively; 2) the legal and ethical considerations involved in exposing individuals to risk; and 3) the ever-present personality dynamics involved in any decision-making process (e.g., returning individuals to a centrifuge panel or flying duty after a medically disqualifying incident). All of these factors influence decisions made in both communities, and how they interact with each other. It is a dynamic process that varies between countries, individual services (e.g., Navy vs Air Force), and even between different geographical locations within the same service.</abstract>', ""<title>The healthy motivation to fly: No psychiatric diagnosis</title> <abstract>Aircrew mission effectiveness may uniquely be influenced by subtle psychological factors not ordinarily brought to the attention of psychiatrists.

This qualitative semi-structured interview study examined the perceived triggering factors and motivations for DPB and the subsequent impact of DPB upon cabin crew well-being and safety. Twenty-four European cabin crew disclosed experiences, subjective observations of perpetrator traits, assessment of DPB development and information regarding their well-being and perceived safety. Thematic analysis revealed that the perceived frequency of DPB had increased, driven by an accumulation of pandemic-related factors–such as enforcing mask wearing amongst intoxicated passengers. DPB was found to decrease resilience and spur maladaptive coping strategies in crew. Suggested enhancements to current\xa0DPB mitigation consisted of stricter punishment for DPB as a deterrent, alcohol bans and higher quality training.

This case study emphasises the role of employees in delivering superior customer experience. This case study explores many facets of customer experience, reputation, social class membership and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Students will be able to apply theories of customer experience, behavioural psychology and service dimensions relevant to the airline industry. After completing this case study, students will be able to do the following:1. Evaluate the value of SOPs in Customer ManagementThis case study refers to the need for adhering to SOPs to deal with complex situations. Students will be able to evaluate whether compliance to SOPs could have helped Air India avoid the crisis or was it possible that a culture of absolute commitment to customer wellbeing could have prevented the crisis.2. Apply the theory of defensive attribution in customer grievance handling. Discuss if reducing customer effort in getting their problem solved can result in superior customer service.The victim had attributed the blame for not insisting on filing a complaint to the crew. Air India crew had defended their actions or lack of it by stating that they had followed the rule book. Students will be able to appreciate the need for a swift redressal mechanism to protect the self-image and self-esteem of the person/group involved. They will also understand that customer service interactions designed to solve customer problems swiftly and easily can be a very simple dictum to guide all employees in their decision-making while handling a customer complaint. 3. Evaluate the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer experience and examine the value of net promoter score (NPS) to study customer satisfaction. Air India Airlines was catering to varied customer groups such as the Indian diaspora, large student population pursuing education abroad, first-time flyers and the rising middle class with travel aspirations. Customer expectations vary across segments and change over their lifetime. Airline staff must trace customer corridors and deliver on customer expectation across the touch points that matter to them to ensure meaningful and relevant service delivery. Students will have an opportunity to evaluate the NPS in measuring customer satisfaction and debate whether it is a sufficient metric to guide the organisation on delivering and monitoring customer experience. 4. Examine why reputation risk management and not crisis management should be the focus of Air India in delivering superior customer service because nearly 70%–80% of market value for a company comes from its intangible assets such as brand equity and reputation. Students will discuss crisis management i.e. handling the threat to reputation after it has occurred and reputation risk management i.e. proactively managing potential threats to its reputation by taking timely actions to avoid or mitigate it. There are three factors (reputation reality gap, changing beliefs and expectation and weak internal coordination) that determine reputational risks. Students can evaluate this model to determine if Air India should address these three factors to manage its reputation proactively. Case overview/synopsis: This case study is set around an incident that happened on 26 November 2022, on Air India flight bound for Delhi from New York when an inebriated 34-year-old man had peed on a 72-year-old woman. The perpetrator of the crime had walked free, and the victim was left dissatisfied with how the cabin crew had handled her ordeal. Air India Airlines was launched in 1932 by industrialist JRD Tata and nationalised in 1953. In 2021, Tata Group acquired the 90-year-old Air India from the Government of India for $2.4bn (INR 18,000 crore) and appointed Campbell Wilson as chief executive officer and managing director. The incident brought to the fore the customer management issues that Wilson had to address. First on the list of Air India’s turnaround plan was delivering “exceptional customer experience”. How was it going to achieve it because the Indian aviation ecosystem lacked infrastructure such as airports, airspace, competition and customer preference-based services? There was also shortage of pilots, engineers, technicians, air-traffic controllers and technocrats to occupy positions within security agencies and regulatory bodies. With Air India’s acquisition, the Tata Group had to find innovative solutions to deal with decades of internal neglect, non-performance and labour union problems. This case study is relevant to address real issues of customer experience, consumer psychology, reputation risk management and standard operating procedures in service management. Complexity academic level: This case is suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate level students of business management. It can also be used for training service personnel of aviation industry. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

Such behavior has been identified by various observers as a growing social problem. This paper explores the phenomenon of assaults against flight attendants through analysis of official data including both case files and statistics, interviews with officials, and a multidisciplinary literature review. Specifically, we identify factors related to both the etiology of, and reactions toward such behavior. Factors related to etiology include (1) the physical environment of an aircraft; (2) the juxtaposition of status roles between passenger and attendant; (3) the exercise of authority as a precipitating event; (4) the pervasiveness of sexual stereotypes; (5) the consumption of alcohol and drugs; and (6) psychological changes related to the experience of flying. In examining the responses to assaults we discuss (1) the statutory laws regarding aircraft assaults; (2) patterns in official statistics; (3) factors related to the underreporting of such incidents; (4) reactions by companies, unions, and the government, including the politics of deviance‐defining; and (5) changes in patterns of response. Unlike common assaults, the offenders are almost exclusively middle‐ and upper‐class persons. Suggestions for further research are offered. © 1983 Hemisphere Publishing Corporation.</abstract>']"

Recent studies have explored multi-biosignal fusion to monitor these states. Despite these efforts, existing methods fail to reflect the complexity and usefulness of various modalities, and do not consider the informativeness of biosignals based on signal quality or the contribution of each modality as biomarkers. To address this issue, we introduce dynamic multi-biosignal fusion (DMBF) to detect the mental states of drivers and passengers. DMBF employs a dynamic gate mechanism that estimates reliability based on data quality through confidence-aware learning, integrating this information into the learning process. Moreover, a spatial-temporal attention module is utilized to capture and combine key biosignal patterns across channels and time. Extensive evaluations were conducted on five datasets related to motion sickness, drowsiness, distraction, emotions, and sustained attention. Each dataset yielded F1 scores of 0.5569, 0.7187, 0.6647, 0.9378, and 0.8092, respectively, outperforming existing baseline models. The experimental results and ablation studies have demonstrated that DMBF is a more robust and versatile method for detecting the mental states of drivers and passengers.

Addressing these issues requires innovative approaches for optimizing road network utilization. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in dynamic scenarios like traffic management, their primary focus has been on single-agent setups, limiting their applicability to real-world multi-agent systems. Managing agents and fostering collaboration in a multi-agent reinforcement learning scenario remains a challenging task. This paper introduces a cooperative multi-agent federated reinforcement learning algorithm named FLDQN to address the challenge of agent cooperation by solving travel time minimization challenges in dynamic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios. FLDQN leverages federated learning to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among intelligent agents, optimizing vehicle routing and reducing congestion in dynamic traffic environments. Using the SUMO simulator, multiple agents equipped with deep Q-learning models interact with their local environments, share model updates via a federated server, and collectively enhance their policies using unique local observations while benefiting from the collective experiences of other agents. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FLDQN achieves a significant average reduction of over 34.6% in travel time compared to non-cooperative methods while simultaneously lowering the computational overhead through distributed learning. FLDQN underscores the vital impact of agent cooperation and provides an innovative solution for enabling agent cooperation in a multi-agent environment. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>Intelligent traffic management via personalized group consensus based on chimp optimization-guided random vector functional link and quantum theory: A perspective of randomization</title> <abstract>In urban traffic management, bike-sharing systems are crucial for green transportation. However, due to the uneven distribution of shared bikes and randomization of user behavior, the urban dockless bicycle sharing system (UDBSS) faces issues of randomization. Since rebalancing in UDBSS involves the opinion and preference of multiple stakeholders, it can be modeled as a group consensus problem. Nevertheless, mutual influence among users, changing preferences, and psychological inconsistencies, along with the absence of personalized strategies in traditional methods, adversely affect demand decisions for UDBSS. To address this issue, this paper innovatively combines random vector functional link (RVFL) networks, quantum theory (QT), and prospect–regret theory (P–RT), to construct a personalized two-stage group consensus framework. First, with the support of three-way decisions, an improved K-means++ algorithm based on Euclidean distances and Hausdorff distances is used for clustering, which reduces the uncertainty in the UDBSS problem. Additionally, to address the randomization issue, RVFL is used to calculate intragroup user weights, and the chimp optimization algorithm (CHOA) is applied for the hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, considering users’ psychological behavior, a two-stage consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed, and a personalized adjustment mechanism based on QT, P–RT, and hesitation degrees is proposed. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a shared bicycle deployment scenario, with experimental analysis using data from the Citi Bike system and survey data to verify its effectiveness and feasibility. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Emotion Transition Recognition Using Multimodal Physiological Signal Fusion</title> <abstract>Most existing emotion recognition studies rely on discrete stimulus paradigms under controlled laboratory conditions, failing to capture the inherently dynamic and transitional nature of emotional states encountered in real-world operational environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach for emotion transition recognition using multimodal physiological signal fusion. Thirty participants, including 10 licensed pilots and 20 non-pilots controls, were recruited to view 48 video stimuli de-signed to elicit six distinct emotional transitions. We introduce a two-stage progressive recognition framework to enhance performance in emotional transition modeling. In Stage I, differential entropy features extracted from EEG signals are integrated with Big Five personality traits to construct an occupation-based trait classification model, capturing cognitive-emotional patterns associated with occupational background and providing individualized priors. In Stage II, we develop the temporal spatial embed ding bidirectional cross-attention fusion network (TSE-BCAF), which employs parallel convolutional modules to extract deep spatial features from multimodal EEG and EOG signals. These features are fused via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to model inter-modal interactions, then processed by a Trans former-based temporal encoder to capture the evolving dynamics of emotional transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

In this paper, we introduce XGate, a novel explainable reinforcement learning framework designed specifically for API traffic management in sensor networks. XGate addresses the critical challenge of balancing optimal routing decisions with the interpretability demands of network administrators operating large-scale IoT deployments. Our approach integrates transformer-based attention mechanisms with counterfactual reasoning to provide human-comprehensible explanations for each traffic management decision across distributed sensor data streams. Through extensive experimentation on three large-scale sensor API traffic datasets, we demonstrate that XGate achieves 23.7% lower latency and 18.5% higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art black-box reinforcement learning approaches. More importantly, our user studies with sensor network administrators ( (Formula presented.) ) reveal that XGate’s explanation capabilities improve operator trust by 67% and reduce intervention time by 41% during anomalous sensor traffic events. The theoretical analysis further establishes probabilistic guarantees on explanation fidelity while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time sensor data management.

We demonstrate the relationship between voice parameters and cognitive performance in: 1) a task with psychological test character, and 2) performance in an operational, mission-relevant task. The central methodological aim was to verify the usefulness of voice commands and counting in providing anchor values for the step-function model of voice pitch. METHODS: During a 22-yr period, 42 cosmonauts participated in the Russian space experiment ""Pilot"", which was a hand-controlled docking maneuver. As reference the experiment included the cognitive task ""Manometer."" This task was controlled through voice commands. These voice commands were stored and are the basis for the present analysis. RESULTS: Cosmonauts differed in their working style and respective performance during the Manometer task. Clustered groups can be assumed to represent different effort. Importantly, these groups differed in the changes of voice pitch among mission phases and among task repetitions. However, there were no differences between these motivation groups and performance in the professional task. DISCUSSION: The differing effort is the effect of different motivation of cosmonauts for experimental test tasks vs. mission-relevant professional tasks. Latter ones provide a more reliable chance to assess the real actual state and skills of a cosmonaut.

The analysis reveals important differences in the information as compared to the task of tracking straight trajectories investigated in a companion paper (Mulder, 2003). The optical gradients of perspective and compression that support pilot control behavior in straight tunnels are less useful in curved tunnels. First, curved trajectories yield no vanishing point or any other stationary optical invariant that can act as a reference for the change in the optical information. Second, only the optical gradients conveyed by the nearby elements of the tunnel provide valuable information about the aircraft locomotion. Third, due to the limitations of using a perspective display, the projection of a curved tunnel results in a biased pilot perception of the aircraft position and motion relative to the trajectory. The lower information-content of the display makes curved trajectories more difficult to follow than straight trajectories, deteriorating pilot path-following performance.

Given the unfavorable road geometry and rapid cross-section transitions, drivers face significant safety concerns. This study aims to investigate drivers’ safety performance at closely spaced tunnel-interchange sections and determine how safety risks can be mitigated through improved traffic control devices design. Methods: Thirty-nine participants conducted an experimental study in a fixed-base simulator. The test scenario was modeled on the Xingyan Freeway-S3801 and accurately reproduced in the simulator. For each safety performance metric, the driving simulator experiments yielded a dataset with 780 observations. To address the idiosyncratic variation due to individual driver differences, a series of linear mixed effects models (LMM) were developed to analyze drivers’ behavior responses. Results: In closely spaced tunnel-interchange sections, a general impairment of both longitudinal and lateral performance was observed. This study identified potential critical impact variables in traffic control device systems. According to the LMM results: (a) Removing the 0.5 km interchange ramp exit advance guide sign located in the tunnel exit area reduces dangerous behavior in the corresponding impact area. (b) Replacing the 0.5 km interchange ramp exit advance guide sign with arrow pavement markers as an information source supports improved driver performance, promoting driver safety. (c) Adding tunnel exit distance signs within tunnels is recommended to enhance situation awareness for drivers. Conclusions: This study addresses the scientific issues related to traffic control devices setup for closely spaced tunnel-interchange sections, focusing on identifying potential critical impact variables.

While psychological and behavioural studies suggest limited user awareness of temporal changes, empirical evidence in transportation remains scarce. This study examines how drivers perceive and report stop times at signalised intersections and assesses their sensitivity to variations in delay. In addition, it explores how different signal displays – conventional signal devices (CSD), hourglass displays (HD), and continuous countdown timers (CCT) – shape drivers’ time perception. Data were collected through roadside interviews and field measurements at three intersections in Iran. Findings indicate that while drivers often overlook minor differences in stop times, they correctly discern broader trends. Notably, time reporting was more consistent among drivers exposed to CCTs, where stop times were under-reported by approximately 20%. In contrast, HD and CSD led to over-reporting by about 15%. The results highlight CCT’s superiority in improving time awareness and reporting accuracy compared to HD and CSD. These insights underscore the importance of signal display design in shaping driver perception and suggest that countdown timers could enhance traffic management strategies by aligning perceived and actual stop times more effectively. © 2025 ICE Publishing.

Methods: A driving simulator replicated 3 curve types by radius—200 m (sharp), 400 m (moderate), and 600 m (loose)—under day and night conditions. The focus of expansion (FOE) is the source point of optical flow, and an FOE model was established to linked the driver’s visual perception with vehicle dynamics. Data on eye movement and vehicle dynamics were collected from 24 drivers (mean age: 27 years, mean driving experience: 3.8 years). Results: The results indicate that driving at night on sharp curves significantly impairs the ability of drivers to align their perception with vehicle motion, leading to delayed steering adjustments and increased lateral errors. The most dangerous areas, identified as the back half of the test curves and corresponding to the minimum FOE radius, were where the misalignment between perception and motion was most significant. On loose curves, decreased driver vigilance was observed, potentially due to a perceived reduction in steering demands, underscoring the role of psychological and contextual factors during curve negotiation. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of optimizing curve radii and enhancing the alignment between drivers’ visual perceptions and vehicle dynamics to reduce accident risks. In real traffic, placing traffic guidance mid-curve may better prompt drivers to slow down, particularly at night. Integrating FOE-based feedback into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) could further enhance performance by offering real-time cues tailored to curve geometry in low visibility. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Bifurcation Analysis of Improved Traffic Flow Model on Curved Road</title> <abstract>Nonlinear analysis of complex traffic flow systems can provide a deep understanding of the causes of various traffic phenomena and reduce traffic congestion, and bifurcation analysis is a powerful method for it. In this paper, based on the improved Aw–Rascle model, a new macroscopic traffic flow model is proposed, which takes into account the road factors and driver psychological factor in the curve environment which can effectively simulate many realistic traffic phenomena on curves. The macroscopic traffic flow model on curved road is analyzed by bifurcation, first, it is transformed into a nonlinear dynamical system, then its stability conditions and the existence conditions of bifurcations are derived, and the changes of trajectories near the equilibrium points are described by phase plane. From an equilibrium point, various bifurcation structures describing the nonlinear traffic flow are obtained. In this paper, the influence of different bifurcations on traffic flow is analyzed, and the causes of special traffic phenomena such as stop-and-go and traffic clustering are described using Hopf bifurcation as the starting point of density temporal evolution.

Because LFI is frequently limited by pilots not reporting incidents voluntarily, we interviewed seven commercial aviation safety experts in a focus group to derive factors influencing the voluntary reporting behavior of pilots' self-inflicted incidents. As a result, we derived 36 factors and integrated them into a motivational framework by van den Broeck et al. (2019). Pilots pursue various goals when voluntarily reporting incidents, such as enabling safetyrelated change or organizational learning.

A better understanding of accident factors allows for better development of preventive measures. This study analyzes ultralight accidents with respect to significant factors related to active and latent failures, as referred to in Reason's Swiss cheese model of human error. Methods: There were 66 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ultralight accident reports that were examined from 1985-2004. Contextual information about active and latent failures was identified, compiled, and cross-referenced with pilot, aircraft, and accident information for evidence of significant relationships. Results: Pilots with less than 40 make/model-specific flying hours were significantly more likely to crash fatally (χ2 = 9.07; p < 0.005; df = 1) than other pilots and/or because of losing control (χ2 = 7.24; p < 0.05; df = 1) than other accident causes. In contrast, pilots with 40 or more make/model-specific flying hours were significantly more likely to crash as a result of engine failure (χ2 = 9.33; p < 0.005; df = 1). Loss of control as an active failure was usually associated with such latent failures as strong winds and insufficient mission planning, while the engine failure accidents involved inadequate maintenance. Conclusion: In order to reduce accident prevalence, ultralight self-regulation organizations should focus on training in mission planning, aircraft familiarity, and proper maintenance procedures. Further research should concentrate on explaining the prevalence of the active and latent failures shown here and determining the effects of the FAA's new light sport aircraft category. © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"", '<title>Why Learning Opportunities from Aviation Incidents Are Lacking: the Impact of Active and Latent Failures and Confidential Reporting</title> <abstract>The rising trend of fatal aircraft accidents since 2018 suggests a limited safety capability of airlines in terms of learning from incidents (LFI). We evaluated 2,208 voluntary incident reports from commercial European pilots using qualitatively driven mixed methods to investigate LFI bottlenecks. The results showed that the report frequency depends on the type of pilots active failure causing the incident (performance-based errors, judgment and decision-making errors and violations). Learning opportunities were lacking, especially for incidents caused by pilots inadequate decision-making. Confidential reporting has positive effects on LFI, as these reports contained more information about latent failures. Furthermore, we identified several latent failures that are risk factors for certain unsafe acts. Our results may support airlines in various LFI activities. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>', '<title>The attributes of medical event-reporting systems: Experience with a prototype medical event-reporting system for transfusion medicine</title> <abstract>Objective. - To design, develop, and implement a prototype medical event-reporting system for use in transfusion medicine to improve transfusion safety by studying incidents and errors. Methods. - The IDEALS concept of design was used to identify specifications for the event-reporting system, and a Delphi and subsequent nominal group technique meetings were used to reach consensus on the development of the system. An interdisciplinary panel of experts from aviation safety, nuclear power, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and education and representatives of major transfusion medicine organizations participated in the development process. Setting. - Three blood centers and three hospitals transfusion services implemented the reporting system. Results. - A working prototype event- reporting system was recommended and implemented. The system has seven components: detection, selection, description, classification, computation, interpretation, and local evaluation. Its unique features include no-fault reporting initiated by the individual discovering the event, who submits a report that is investigated by local quality assurance personnel and forwarded to a nonregulatory central system for computation and interpretation. Conclusions. - An event-reporting system incorporated into present quality assurance and risk management efforts can help organizations address system structural and procedural weakness where the potential for errors can adversely affect health care outcomes. Input from the end users of the system as well as from external experts should enable this reporting system to serve as a useful model for others who may develop event-reporting systems in other medical domains.</abstract>', '<title>Barriers and Facilitators to Voluntary Reporting and Their Impact on Safety Culture</title> <abstract>Objective: Determine barriers and facilitators to effective voluntary reporting system (VRS) operation. Background: As human error accounts for a larger portion of accidents and incidents in high-risk industries, federal agencies that define regulations and guidelines promote various safety management techniques, including more robust safety data collection. VRSs aim to identify and address “near misses” (errors identified before resulting in negative outcomes) through employee disclosure of committed errors and violations. Despite their value, VRSs are underutilized. Method: A literature review was conducted to understand successful safety management practices and challenges, and define reporting requirements for accidents, incidents, and near misses (which rely on voluntary disclosure). Variations in the policies, processes, and utility of several VRSs were explored, and common themes were identified. Interviews were then conducted with VRS developers, users, and managers to further explore these themes. Results: The literature review narrowed the focus to confidential, nonpunitive VRSs for process and product safety concerns, such as the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). Common themes exposed 8 categories of barriers and facilitators to effective VRS operation, participation, and use of report data. The literature review verified and elaborated on these barriers, and offered solutions (facilitators) based on personal observations and experiences. Conclusion: Consistent themes associated with effective and ineffective VRS operation can be used to improve VRS participation and the effectiveness of error prediction and prevention capabilities. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>']"

The overall task environment included tracking, resource management, and multiple monitoring subtasks. Slower, more accurate monitoring and better resource management were observed when the tracking subtask was automated. Although lower workload was reported when tracking was automated, fatigue increased equally during periods of manual and automatic tracking. When participants could control workload by shifting between manual and automatic tracking, participants with 7 hr of training switched between automatic and manual tracking. Their performance during optional automation periods was superior to their performance in conditions in which only manual control or only automated control was available.

Background: Trust is one critical factor that influences successful human-automation interaction. In the previous research, operators reported lower trust scores and made fewer fixation toward an automated system, which assisted a task, when competing task in the same workspace demanded more attention from the operator. However, it is unclear whether human-automation trust is influenced by frequent shift of attention away from a task assisted by an automated signaling system. Methods: Participants concurrently performed a tracking task, a system monitoring task, and a communication task. An automated signaling system was employed to assist the system monitoring task with 70% reliability. Task load was manipulated by the difficulty of the tracking task while interruption load was manipulated by the varying the frequency of auditory messages in the communication task. Results: Results demonstrated an effect of task load on human-automation trust and resource allocation, replicating previous findings. Further, participants responded faster to an auditory message that occurred less frequently when performing a tracking task at the low difficulty level but automation trust did not vary. Conclusion: While operators reported higher trust levels to imperfect automation under lower task load, number of interrupting events does not influence their trust. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Performance Consequences of Automation-Induced “Complacency”</title> <abstract>The effect of variations in the reliability of an automated monitoring system on human operator detection of automation failures was examined in two experiments. For four 30-min sessions, 40 subjects performed an IBM PC-based flight simulation that included manual tracking and fuel-management tasks, as well as a system-monitoring task that was under automation control. Automation reliability'the percentage of system malfunctions detected by the automation routine'either remained constant at a low or high level over time or alternated every 10 min from low to high. Operator detection of automation failures was substantially worse for constant-reliability than for variable-reliability automation after about 20 min under automation control, indicating that the former condition induced “complacency”. When system monitoring was the only task, detection was very efficient and was unaffected by variations in automation reliability. The results provide the first empirical evidence of the performance consequences of automation-induced “complacency”.

The objective was to examine how the type of automation imperfection (miss vs. false alarm) affects ATSP performance and attention allocation. Background: Research has shown that the type of automation imperfection leads to differential human performance costs. Method: Participating in four 30-min scenarios were 12 full-performance-level ATSPs. Dependent variables included conflict detection and resolution performance, eye movements, and subjective ratings of trust and self confidence. Results: ATSPs detected conflicts faster and more accurately with reliable automation, as compared with manual performance. When the conflict probe automation was unreliable, conflict detection performance declined with both miss (25% conflicts detected) and false alarm automation (50% conflicts detected). Conclusion: When the primary task of conflict detection was automated, even highly reliable yet imperfect automation (miss or false alarm) resulted in serious negative effects on operator performance. Application: The further in advance that conflict probe automation predicts a conflict, the greater the uncertainty of prediction; thus, designers should provide users with feedback on the state of the automation or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of the data underlying the conflict probe algorithm. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>']"

Methods: The subjects in PH1 were 30 students and 33 instructors, and in PH2 were 17 students and 15 instructors. Urine and saliva were collected approximately 30 min before and 20 min after the flights. The ratio (post/preflight) of the hormonal levels was calculated to compare the students with the instructors and/or PH1 with PH2. Results: In PH1, the levels of all three hormones for postflight were significantly higher than for preflight in students, and the ratios of all three hormones in students were significantly higher than in instructors. In PH2, the ratios of all three hormones for students and instructors did not differ significantly, and the ratios of Ad and Cor levels in students for PH2 were significantly lower than for PH1 (Ad: 1.64 ± 0.10 vs. 2.23 ± 0.14; Cor: 0.86 ± 0.16 vs. 1.68 ± 0.11, respectively). Conclusions: The results from PH1 clearly demonstrated that flight stress for students was significantly higher than for instructors.

The relationship between the hormonal response and flying performance was also investigated. Methods: Urinary zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), noradrenaline (NAd), adrenaline (Adr), and saliva cortisol (Cs) levels were determined in 67 pilot applicants and compared with NAd, Adr, and Cs levels in 30 instructor pilots during 4 flight tests. Results: Applicants had significantly decreased Zn concentrations following flight, but Cu concentrations remained unchanged. NAd, Adr, and Cs concentrations significantly increased following flight; the average ratio (post-/pre-flight) of the hormonal levels of the applicants was 1.52 (NAd), 3.57 (Adr), and 2.80 (Cs) compared with 1.86 (Adr) in instructors (NAd and Cs concentrations were not significantly changed in instructors following flight). Multiple regression analyses of post-flight levels of Zn for the hormonal levels revealed that Zn levels correlated significantly (p < 0.05) negatively with Adr levels. Hormonal responses for the best-rated and worst- rated applicant groups were greater than in the other groups, and post- flight levels of NAd and Adr in the best-rated group tended to return more rapidly to pre-flight levels. Conclusion: Flight test stress causes pilot applicants to change levels of urinary Zn, NAd, Adr, and Cs. Post-flight Zn decrement was likely related to an increase in Adr, suggesting that circulating Zn is sequestered by the liver in situations that induce hormonal changes.</abstract>', ""<title>Neuroendocrine responses and psychomotor test results in subjects participating in military pilot selection</title> <abstract>Background: Military flying sets high demands on the mental performance and stress tolerance of pilots. Neuroendocrine responses could be a method for evaluating stress tolerance. Methods: Psychological workload and neuroendocrine responses associated with the psychomotor Wiener's test were studied in 80 male volunteers. These personnel had applied for the basic military flying program of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). After the first blood sample at 0930 h, the subjects were randomly assigned to test (n = 40) and control groups (n = 40). The test group performed the psychomotor test, which lasted 10 min. The second blood sample was collected 1 min after the test. The control group was clinically examined and the blood sample was taken in the same way. Results: A high plasma ACTH level before the psychomotor test predicted (r = 0.36, p = 0.02) a poor overall result in the psychomotor test. After the psychomotor test, plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and β- endorphin levels were significantly higher than before the test. They were also higher than in the control group. Plasma cortisol and prolactin levels increased after the psychomotor test, but the increase was not statistically significant. High ACTH, cortisol and prolactin increments were specific to a high amount of delayed (over 2 s) psychomotor responses, as a marker of information overload. Conclusions: Elevated plasma ACTH, cortisol and prolactin levels, after the psychomotor test, were associated with a high amount of the delayed responses. This indicates that high neuroendocrine responses were connected with problems in stress tolerance during information processing. High neuroendocrine reactions under information load could, therefore, be used for identification of lowered stress tolerance.</abstract>"", '<title>Flight-associated cortisol dynamics and subjective assessments of pain and stress in fighter pilots: an exploratory study</title> <abstract>Purpose: Operating a high-performance fifth-generation fighter jet is a potential stressor in which hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dynamics may reflect the intensity of and adaptation to the stressor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate HPA axis activity in fighter pilots and explore whether indices of activity correlated with subjective indices of stress. Methods: We studied HPA axis dynamics in 20 experienced fifth-generation fighter pilots (18 men/2 women) by measuring salivary cortisol at various times from bedtime the night before a flight training to awakening the morning after the flight training. We also measured plasma ACTH and serum cortisol the day before the flight and immediately following the flight. These findings were correlated with prior pilot flight experience and subjective assessments of pain and stress. Results: Seven (35%) of the pilots demonstrated normal salivary cortisol levels at all time points despite one having a high index of pain. Lower pre-flight salivary cortisol was correlated with more flight hours in the year leading up to the flight exercise. Flight day awakening salivary cortisol was inversely correlated with pilot-reported post-flight stress. In general, there were no other major correlations suggesting a disconnect between an objective measure of stress via HPA axis dynamics and subjective indices of stress and pain. Conclusion: The acute HPA axis response in some experienced fighter pilots habituates to the stressor of flying a fighter jet during a training exercise. The experience of the pilot was a determinant of their HPA axis stress response. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>', ""<title>Neuroendocrine responses to real and simulated BA Hawk MK 51 flight</title> <abstract>The effects of psychological workload on the plasma levels of eight neuroendocrine hormones were studied in 5 undergraduate and 5 senior military pilots of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). All subjects performed the same short- term basic flight mission, which included the following: 1) start; 2) ILS- approach in minimum weather conditions; 3) visual approach; and 4) landing. The mission was performed twice: first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with a BA Hawk MK 51 let trainer with Gx- forces below +2. Blood samples were collected 30 min before and 10 min after the mission and were measured for adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, β- endorphin, prolactin, vasopressin (AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and cortisol. The plasma levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, β- endorphin, and cortisol did not change significantly in response to simulated or real flight. Plasma prolactin levels increased significantly (p = 0.037) in all subjects after the mission performed with jet trainer, and the increase was especially great in cadets. However, the same mission performed with the simulator did not raise plasma prolactin levels. This finding suggests that the psychological workload in a flight simulator does not correspond to the psychological workload in a real jet trainer, at least not in basic flying. Plasma AVP increased significantly (p = 0.032) after the mission performed with the simulator in cadets; this increase can be described as a 'first-time effect.' Plasma ANP also increased significantly (p < 0.05) after a real jet trainer flight. ANP generally maintains the electrolyte and water balance, but it is possible that elevated plasma ANP levels during a military flight are due to an increased workload of the heart and sympathetic stimuli. Because the psychological workload of the flight missions was not extreme, basic military flying had no effect off the usual stress hormones such as ACTH, β-endorphin, and cortisol in this study. Certain hormones, especially prolactin, and to a lesser degree ANP and AVP, appear to be sensitive to psychological workload.</abstract>""]"

It was hypothesized that the international nature of the job would be reflected in findings from all three groups of controllers. It was further hypothesized, however, that environmental and cultural factors would produce differences among the groups and that these would be greater between the Asian and the two ""Western"" cultures than between the two earlier samples studied. Results showed that the two Western cultures share 56% common variance in their perceptions of stressfulness, but this changes to 35% between the New Zealand and Singapore groups and only 21% between Canada and Singapore. Although comparison of the factor structure of the stress ratings of the Singapore and New Zealand samples again confirmed a general pattern of underlying stressors related to air traffic control (which fits general occupational models of stress), it also revealed culturally specific components. The nature of these suggests that they are embedded in the context of Asian environments and cultures.

Unfortunately, different experts define stress in strikingly different ways, allowing for a kind of shell game in which the very existence of stress can become problematical. In addition, the stress experts have been unable to offer more than weak data to support the theories that link difficult working conditions to pathological outcomes. Thus workers are likely to lose labor disputes that depend on the stress discourse.

The necessity for assessing a number of psychological dimensions in a single session often demands ""short"" tests capable of assessing individual differences in abilities such as vigilance and maintenance of high performance levels. In the present paper two tasks were selected as candidates for playing this role, the Abbreviated Vigilance Task (AVT) by Temple, Warm, Dember, LaGrange and Matthews (1996) and the Continuous Attention Test (CAT) by Tiplady (1992). However, when applied to a sample of 829 candidates in a job-selection process for air-traffic controllers, neither of them showed discriminative capacity. In a second study, an extended version of the CAT was applied to a similar sample of 667 subjects, but also proved incapable of properly detecting individual differences.

The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions. While PPP was poorer in the SART than in the TVF, that result could be accounted for by a loss of motor control rather than a lack of mindfulness. Identical high levels of workload were generated by the TVF and SART tasks, and observers in both conditions showed similar dynamic scanning of the visual scene.Conclusion: The data indicate that the SART is not an engine of mindlessness.Application: The results challenge the widespread use of the SART to support a model in which mindlessness is considered to be the principal root of detection failures in vigilance.</abstract>', '<title>The Role of State and Trait Self-Control on the Sustained Attention to Response Task</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to assess the plausibility of self-control depletion, or ego-depletion, as the underlying cognitive resource responsible for performance decrements on the sustained attention to response task. Background: Researchers suggested that self-control is a limited cognitive resource used to complete a myriad of processes, including sustained attention. Past research showed that trait self-control affects some sustained attention tasks. However, little research has investigated the effect of self-control as a limited cognitive resource that varies over time (i.e., as a state-dependent variable). Methods: This experiment investigated the effect of self-control (trait and state) on a sustained motor-inhibition task (e.g., sustained attention to response task; SART). State self-control was manipulated using a between-subjects design—participants in the experimental condition completed a task designed to deplete state self-control prior to performing the SART while the control condition completed a modified version that did not deplete self-control. Results: Trait self-control predicted performance on the SART, but the depletion task (state self-control) had no detectable effect. Conclusion: Given the evidence, it is unlikely that state self-control plays a causal role in performance decrements in the SART, but there appears to be some association between performance on the SART and trait self-control. Application: Trait self-control ought to be considered in future work for personnel selection in real-world tasks that the SART models such as long-distance driving, air traffic control, and TSA operations. © 2023 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>', ""<title>Measures and interpretations of vigilance performance: Evidence against the detection criterion</title> <abstract>Operators' performance in a vigilance task is often assumed to depend on their choice of a detection criterion. When the signal rate is low this criterion is set high, causing the hit and false alarm rates to be low. With increasing time on task the criterion presumably tends to increase even further, thereby further decreasing the hit and false alarm rates. Virtually all of the empirical evidence for this simple interpretation is based on estimates of the bias measure β from signal detection theory. In this article, I describe a new approach to studying decision making that does not require the technical assumptions of signal detection theory. The results of this new analysis suggest that the detection criterion is never biased toward either response, even when the signal rate is low and the time on task is long. Two modifications of the signal detection theory framework are considered to account for this seemingly paradoxical result. The first assumes that the signal rate affects the relative sizes of the variances of the information distributions; the second assumes that the signal rate affects the logic of the operator's stopping rule. Actual or potential applications of this research include the improved training and performance assessment of operators in areas such as product quality control, air traffic control, and medical and clinical diagnosis.</abstract>""]"

The FCMs then performed 3 minutes of a computer-based cognitive task called synthetic work environment (SYNWIN test battery). Task performance was compared with the questionnaire variables using correlation and regression analysis. Differences between the beginning and end of each shift were matched and compared using a paired Students t test. Results. SYNWIN performance was significantly worse at the end of a shift compared with the beginning of the shift (p = 0.028) primarily because of decrement in the memory component. The SYNWIN composite scores were negatively correlated to degree of irritability felt by the participant, both before (r = -0.25) and after (r = -0.34) a shift and were significantly correlated with amount of sleep (0.22), rest (0.30), and life satisfaction (0.30). Conclusions. Performance by FCMs on a simple, rapid, computer-based psychological test correlates well with self-reported sleep, rest, life satisfaction, and irritability. Although further studies are warranted, these findings suggest that assessment of the performance of FCMs on a simple, rapid, computer-based, multitasking battery is feasible as an approach to determine their readiness to perform critical safety tasks through the SYNWIN task battery. © 2011 National Association of EMS Physicians.</abstract>"", ""<title>Application of LC-MS-based global metabolomic profiling methods to human mental fatigue</title> <abstract>Mental fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for work and a loss of capacity to respond to stimulation and is usually accompanied by a feeling of tiredness and drowsiness. Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers' urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively. Three candidate biomarkers were selected on the basis of statistical significance, coefficient of variance, and compared with data of the three groups. The results suggest that urine metabolites may provide a complete new clue from biochemistry to understand, monitor, and manage human mental fatigue. © 2016 American Chemical Society.</abstract>"", '<title>Detecting fatigue in car drivers and aircraft pilots by using non-invasive measures: The value of differentiation of sleepiness and mental fatigue</title> <abstract>Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most crucial factors that contribute to a decrease of the operating performance of aircraft pilots and car drivers and, as such, plays a dangerous role in transport safety. To reduce fatigue-related tragedies and to increase the quality of a healthy life, many studies have focused on exploring effective methods and psychophysiological indicators for detecting and monitoring fatigue. However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and field studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, fitness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufficient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters. © 2020 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Examining the effects of combined stressors on dynamic task performance</title> <abstract>In this study, I examined the effects of sleep loss, time pressure, and workload on performance in a dynamic air traffic control (ATC) task.

In general, the findings revealed that ATC performance was susceptible to the effects of time pressure and workload. However, there was only partial support for the assumption that the effects of sleep loss on performance are dependent on the level of cognitive challenge posed by a task. Furthermore, I observed a dissociation between ATC performance and subjective assessments of workload (i.e., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index; Hart & Staveland, 1988), suggesting that the cognitive processes responsible for performance are not identical to those processes responsible for subjective assessments of workload.</abstract>']"

The data was collected from airline passengers by utilizing the convenient sampling method. A total of 488 surveys out of 520 participants were included in the analyses conducted using Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) software. The results show that the appearances and attitudes of uniformed cabin crews significantly affect the repurchase intention, and while the brand perception only mediates the effect of attitudes on repurchase intention, the brand imagery both appearances and attitudes of uniformed cabin crews. Results suggest that airlines need to pay attention to both the attitudes and the appearance of the cabin crew to make the passengers feel that the airline is their own extent and, in return, to increase passengers’ repurchase intention. Unlike previous studies, this research focuses on the interplay between visual branding through uniforms and passengers’ psychological mechanisms driving loyalty explained by Social Identity Theory and Aesthetic Labor Theory. This research demonstrates the strategic role of cabin crew in creating a brand experience that is different but reflective of their own identity. © 2025 The Author(s).

The study aims to analyze how cabin crew’s competency and professional identity affect their career success, with the aim of providing airlines with practical guidance on cabin crew training and human resource management. This study constructed a theoretical model based on competency theory, career identity theory, and career success theory, and tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling by distributing questionnaires to 500 cabin crew members of Xiamen Airlines, and analyzed the differences using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of the study showed that: (1) cabin crew’s competency has a significant positive effect on professional identity; (2) cabin crew’s competency has a significant positive effect on career success; (3) cabin crew’s professional identity has a significant positive effect on career success; (4) professional identity plays a mediating role between competency and career success; and (5) there are significant differences between cabin crew with different educational backgrounds in terms of competency, professional identity and career success. © 2024 The Author(s).

We also analyzed the effect of empathy on variables such as team performance, organizational atmosphere, and instances of irregularity. We analyzed 230 samples obtained from an online questionnaire and convenience sampling of full-service domestic and international carriers in South Korea. A structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that uncommonly attentive behavior, courteous behavior, connecting behavior, and information-sharing behavior showed a positive effect on empathy among colleagues, which in turn positively influenced team performance, organizational atmosphere, and possible irregularities. Moreover, we found that the presence of participants’ closest colleagues within the same team did not moderate the relationship between rapport-building and empathic behavior between airline crew members. Our study has important implications for crew members’ dignity and protection from emotional labor while working in high-pressure environments. Our findings can be used to revise the airline industry’s crew management guidelines and improve the crew’s psychological health and quality of life. © 2021 by the authors.

This study examined whether internship experience influences aviation students’ career motivation and professional attitude through the mediating role of professional identity. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 414 aviation service students using validated psychological measures. Mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS Model 4 with 5,000 bootstrap samples. Gender and first-choice major were included as covariates. Results: Higher-quality internship experiences significantly enhanced students’ professional identity, which strongly predicted both career motivation (β = 0.50***) and professional attitude (β = 0.48***). Professional identity partially mediated the effect of internship experience on career motivation (indirect effect = 0.30) and fully mediated its effect on professional attitude (indirect effect = 0.24**). Discussion: These findings demonstrate that internships shape students’ long-term career outcomes primarily by strengthening their professional identity rather than through direct experiential effects alone. Professional identity is therefore a critical psychological mechanism in aviation talent development, emphasizing the need for identity-supportive internship programs. © © 2025 Wang.</abstract>']"

They chose referents for sentences referring to a protagonist or minor character mentioned 1 sentence (recent character) or 3 sentences (distant character) before this target sentence. All groups chose referents less accurately for sentences about distant and minor characters than about recent and protagonist characters, perhaps because these referents were less likely to be in working memory. Young readers and pilots were more accurate for distant and minor character target sentences in aviation narratives, and recalled aviation narratives more accurately.

They read back each message, then answered a probe question about the aircraft's route. Pilots read back messages more accurately than did nonpilots, and younger participants were more accurate than older participants. Expertise and aging had similar effects on the probe task, suggesting that these groups were better able to interpret the air traffic control messages in relation to the chart, in order to create a situation model of the flight. Expertise did not moderate age-related declines on the aviation tasks studied here. There was, however, some evidence that more flying experience among older pilots (compared to younger pilots) helped buffer against age-related declines in cognitive resources, in order to maintain performance on the readback task.

Here, the authors examined whether decades of experience in a fast-paced demanding profession, air traffic control (ATC), would enable older controllers to perform at high levels of proficiency. The authors also investigated whether older controllers would show diminished age-related decrements on domain-relevant cognitive abilities. Both young and old controllers and noncontrollers performed a battery of cognitive and ATC tasks. Results indicate that although high levels of experience can reduce the magnitude of age-related decline on the component processes that underlie complex task performance, this sparing is limited in scope.

All pilots had difficulties in applying the correct recovery template, as their initial response was to counter the wing drop rather than to unload the aircraft. Reproduction of actual g-loads led to significantly longer recoveries, more secondary stick-shaker events, lower maximum load factors, larger altitude loss, and higher speeds.

Background: New flight-safety regulations for commercial aviation recommend the introduction of surprise and startle in upset prevention and recovery training. This calls for more evidence on the effects of surprise on pilot performance, as well as methods to effectively induce surprise in training simulators. Method: The study took place in a motion-base simulator with a poststall aerodynamic model. Using a within-subjects design, the recovery performance of 20 pilots was tested in 2 conditions: 1 anticipated condition, and 1 surprise condition. In addition to flight parameters, subjective and physiological data relating to surprise and startle were measured. Results: Pilots had significantly more difficulties with adhering to the recovery procedure in the surprise condition compared to the anticipation condition. The subjective and physiological measures confirmed that the manipulation mainly increased surprise, and to a lesser extent also startle. Conclusion: The results suggest that pilots have more difficulty in managing an upset situation (i.e., an aerodynamic stall) when this situation is presented unexpectedly, underlining that upset prevention and recovery training should include elements of surprise. ©, © The Authors.

Objective: Thus, we tested the effectiveness a new mnemonic-type procedure in a moving-base simulator with a non-linear model of a small twin-propeller aircraft flown single-pilot. Method: An experimental group of twelve line pilots was trained to use a four-item procedure: 1. Calm down: take a deep breath, sit up straight and relax shoulders and hands. 2. Observe: call out the basic flight parameters. 3. Outline: formulate a hypothesis about the problem. 4. Lead: formulate and execute a plan of action. A control group of twelve line pilots received a control training. Next, all pilots performed four scenarios with startling and surprising events. Data were obtained on pilot performance, stress, procedure application and evaluation. Results: Application of the procedure in the test scenarios was high (90.0% full, 100.0% partly), and pilots evaluated the procedure positively (median: 4 on a 1–5 point scale). There was significantly superior decision-making in the experimental group, but immediate responses were significantly less optimal. Pilots sometimes applied the procedure at inappropriate moments.

Two groups of 20 airline pilots received stall recovery training in a moving-base simulator. The “delayed-response” group induced the stall themselves. The “immediate-response” group was presented with paused situations and had to recover immediately after unpausing. In a surprising transfer test, the pilots in the delayed-response group showed less aggressive unloading, and experienced significantly more time pressure compared to the pilots in the immediate-response group. In a stall cue recognition test, the delayed-response group performed nearly significantly better. We conclude that experiencing the progression of an aerodynamic stall during training has positive effects on pilot performance, even if this requires unprocedural behavior. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>', '<title>Application of rTMS to the Motor Cortex in a Patient with Startle Reaction: A Case Report</title> <abstract>Startle reaction is a physiological muscle reaction that occurs to protect against an unexpected, sudden stimulus.

Residents' knowledge of how to respond to rare, yet potentially life-threatening events has been shown to deteriorate over time and thus cost-effective educational interventions are indicated. Previous research has shown that test-enhanced learning has the potential to strengthen both clinical knowledge and performance. We hypothesised that critical action procedures (CAPs) tests, similar to those employed by high-performance aircraft pilots, would help improve resident knowledge about how to respond to rare and potentially catastrophic events encountered during the perioperative period. Methods: Knowledge assessments were administered to 29 first-year anaesthesiology residents over the course of 9 months. Five-minute closed-book tests were administered with fill-in-the-blank questions regarding the American Society of Anesthesiologists' difficult airway guideline, advanced cardiac life support protocols, an institutional airway fire protocol and drug dosing for malignant hyperthermia. Inter-group comparisons were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The difference between the pre-test and final test scores for each subsection was determined with the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples. Results: Composite subtest scores, when compared with baseline pre-test scores and subsequent scores, and when adjusted for attrition, significantly improved over the course of 9 months (20.5% versus 80%; P ≤ 0.001). Likert-based survey data indicated a positive report for attainment of knowledge. Conclusions: In this longitudinal observational study of first-year anaesthesiology residents, CAPs testing helped improve knowledge about critical events. Although the study was limited by its small number of subjects, a significant attrition rate and the lack of a control group, it demonstrates a cost-effective educational intervention that improved resident knowledge.

We sought to evaluate the performance and preference of air medical personnel using a newer laryngeal tube airway device, the King LT, versus the Combitube in a simulator model. Methods. Participants included flight physicians, nurses, and paramedics in our air medical transport program. Twenty-seven subjects participated. Participants received a 10-minute instructional program, and then had individual practice with each device. Participants were tested on the insertion of each device in a Laerdal SimMan. Rates of successful placement, time to successful placement, and practitioner preference were recorded. Perceived ease of insertion was measured on a five-point scale (1 easy, 5 difficult). Results. All 27 participants correctly placed each device. Mean time to placement was 24.4 seconds (standard deviation [SD] of 4.7 seconds) for the King LT and 37.9 seconds (SD of 5.9 seconds) for the Combitube.

Introduction: Despite some progress, the air medical transport profession continues to experience widely publicized accidents that result in injuries and death to crew members and patients. An air medical crew member's experience, training and confidence may affect his or her ability to deal effectively with an in-flight emergency, and may also affect his or her behavior before and after the emergency. Setting: A hospital-based, rural rotor- and fixed-wing program flying approximately 890 flights per year. Seventy-seven percent of these flights are interfacility. Methods: A pretraining survey evaluated the experiences of air medical crew members and pilots. A 20-question assessment tool based on a 5-point Likert scale evaluated how confident the individuals were in their ability to react to in-flight emergencies. An extensive in-flight emergency training program was then conducted. Personnel were asked to complete the same questionnaire one month and six months after the training. Results: On the pretraining questionnaire, flight crew members with neither prior training nor actual experience in in-flight emergencies showed the lowest level of confidence. Those with prior training, actual in-flight emergency experience or both, responded with higher levels of confidence. The mean confidence scores of the study participants increased from 82 pretraining to 89 at one month post-training and remained at the increased level six months after training. Conclusions: A training program focusing on in-flight, aircraft-related emergencies can increase the crew's confidence during such situations. This increase in confidence is most noticeable in those without previous training or experience and is maintained for at least six months. Several other benefits occur from the training program. © 1994.</abstract>"", ""<title>Crisis management - Validation of an algorithm by analysis of 2000 incident reports</title> <abstract>Anaesthetists are called upon to manage complex life-threatening crises at a moment's notice.

Such an algorithm, based on the mnemonic 'COVER ABCD, A SWIFT CHECK', was developed and refined over 3 meetings, each attended by 60-100 anaesthetists and aviation psychologists. It was validated against 1301 relevant incidents among the first 2000 incidents reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study. It proved sufficiently robust and safe to recommend its general use as an initial response to any incident or crisis which occurs when a patient is breathing gas from an anaesthetic machine. It requires a limited knowledge base and is easily learnt and rehearsed during the anaesthetist's working day. It will provide a functional diagnosis in over 99% of cases and will correct 62% of the problems in 40-60 seconds. In the remaining 37% it will allow the anaesthetist to proceed with a 'sub-algorithm' confident in the knowledge that some important step has not been missed. In just over 30% of incidents this will be for a problem familiar to all anaesthetists (e.g. laryngospasm, bradycardia); in just over 6% it will be for a less common, more complex, but finite, set of problems (3% cardiac arrest, 1% air embolism, 1% anaphylaxis, 1% for the remaining desaturations); in less than 1% diagnosis and correction will require a more complex checklist (e.g. for malignant hyperthermia, pneumothorax).

Psychological well-being has been a popular research topic recently and has been shown to relate to mental health. The analysis of distinct population groups offers unique opportunities for the investigation of the interplay of the psychological, social, and physical elements of health. This study characterizes the psychological wellbeing of a unique, high stress occupational group, United States Air Force fliers (pilots and navigators). Data were obtained from a cross-sectional “Health Survey” of male fliers and nonfliers with 2485 respondents. Mental health was ascertained with an index of psychological well-being (PWB). Additionally, other data relevant to health status were collected. Results of the Alameda County, California, survey of PWB were also used for comparison. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression. Fliers were found to have significantly better PWB than nonfliers; this finding is in accord with clinical folklore regarding differences between fliers and nonfliers. Both Air Force groups had better PWB than that reported for Alameda County. There were no significant differences between pilots and navigators and no differences between pilots of different types of aircraft, results which contradict previous anecdotal reports. Young (age 21 to 28) active pilots were found to be a distinct group with significantly better PWB than any other group. Several variables made small but statistically significant contributions to explaining the variance in PWB. The best correlates of PWB were better self-reported overall health, lack of perceived time pressure, more competitive behavior, and a positive attitude toward physical fitness. The results are discussed in terms of the flier selection process, the intrinsic differences in those who select flying as a vocation, and the interaction of the flier’s developmental stage and his environment. © 1983 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.</abstract>', '<title>Pilot Work Related Stress (WRS), Effects on Wellbeing and Mental Health, and Coping Methods</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between sources of work-related stress (WRS) for pilots, effects on wellbeing, and coping mechanisms. Background: Recent studies have measured depression levels in pilots but not the relationship between depression levels and coping strategies. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted with commercial pilots. A regression model was advanced to analyze the relationship between each frequency level of each coping strategy and PHQ-9 Scores, and the Odds ratio was interpreted. Results: Sources of WRS impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Not all pilots are suffering. Over half met threshold for mild depression. Nearly 60% are using coping mechanisms to manage WRS and its impact on wellbeing. Pilots using coping mechanisms such as sleep management, taking physical exercise, and diet management were found to have lower depression severity levels. The findings of this study underscore the need to advance new tools to enable pilot self-management of their health and wellbeing. This includes new training tools, enhanced checklists, and new digital tools to support wellbeing awareness, stress coping, and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit. Conclusions: Airlines and pilots need the right tools to safeguard the wellbeing and mental fitness of pilots and ensure flight safety. Pilots, airlines, and aviation regulators can learn from the existing use of coping strategies by pilots. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Interventions to support the management of work-related stress (WRS) and wellbeing/mental health issues for commercial pilots</title> <abstract>Research indicates that sources of work-related stress (WRS) impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Furthermore, specific features of the job can increase a pilot’s risk in relation to developing a mental health (MH) issue. It is impossible to remove all stress from the work life of pilots. A high stress situation may not necessarily be detrimental to the person, once they have learned to cope with it in a healthy manner. Nonetheless, risk pertaining to WRS need to be effectively managed by a pilot’s employer. Therefore, it is important to identify solutions at an airline and pilot self-management level. This paper reports on the findings of human factors research undertaken with commercial pilots pertaining to work-related stress (WRS) and its impact on wellbeing, performance, and safety. The findings of a series of co-design workshops and a follow-up anonymous survey were analysed to identify potential solutions at (1) an airline and (2) pilot self-management level. Potential solutions are framed in relation to six impact scenarios. Furthermore, they are located within the existing regulatory framework, including the latest implementation rules (IR), acceptable means of compliance (ACM), and guidance material (GM) as outlined by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA 2019). Proposed interventions should promote wellbeing and positive mental health while also addressing suffering and mental ill health. Airline interventions might focus on enhancing existing Safety Management System (SMS) approaches to better manage risks pertaining to WRS, advancing new tools to enable wellbeing briefing, risk assessment, and reporting, and training pilots in relation to MH awareness, risk identifying behaviour, and coping strategies. Furthermore, new role/functions might be introduced to support the implementation and management of WRS/wellbeing/MH safety/risk processes at an airline level. Requirements for new digital tools to support pilot awareness of WRS/wellbeing/MH, self-management of WRS/wellbeing/MH and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit are also proposed. Some of recommendations arising in this research require changes to the existing rule-making and/or modification to existing AMC and GM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>', '<title>A Qualitative Study Exploring Well-Being and the Potential Impact of Work-Related Stress among Commercial Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>Increasing evidence suggests that commercial airline pilots can experience physical, mental, and social health difficulties. Qualitative interviews with commercial airline pilots explored the relationship between work-related stress and well-being. Participatory workshops involving pilots were conducted. The methodology of this action-based research involved a blend of person-centered design approaches; specifically, stakeholder evaluation and participatory design. The findings further support the hypothesis that pilot well-being is being negatively affected by the nature of their work. The biopsychosocial model of the lived experience of a pilot, as presented in this paper, provides a useful structure to examine pilot well-being, and to identify and scope potential coping strategies to self-manage health and wellbeing issues associated with the job of being a pilot. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>']"

Each subject listened at the speech intensity designated by him as yielded optimal intelligibility. Performance varied directly with the degree of attenuation provided by the headset. Mean intelligibility scores ranged from 73% through the loudspeaker to 92% through two of the headsets, although retesting through the loudspeaker at a higher signal level improved mean scores to 85%. Articulation functions obtained on four normally hearing listeners tested under the same conditions as the pilots revealed that, for situations when little or no attenuation was available (loudspeaker and one headset), greater signal-to-noise ratios were necessary to allow discrimination equivalent to that obtained under conditions of greater noise attenuation (two headsets). Although good intelligibility could be achieved through the loudspeaker given sufficient signal intensity (>100 dB SPL) some pilots preferred lower levels even though discrimination was reduced.</abstract>', '<title>Improving Pilot/Air Traffic Control Voice Communication in General Aviation</title> <abstract>The influence of the air traffic control (ATC) message format and message length was investigated on the ability of general aviation pilots to read back ATC instructions. While flying a simulator, 12 pilots heard altitude and radio frequency instructions spoken in grouped format (""forty-one-hundred""), and 12 heard them sequentially (""four-thousand-one-hundred""). Only limited evidence was found that grouped message format improved pilot memory. Specifically, pilots who received altitude and radio frequency instructions in the grouped, rather than the sequential, format produced fewer requests for clarification, especially for longer messages. Pilots were also more likely to read back the grouped instructions in sequential format, suggesting that prior experience with the sequential format influenced pilot communication involving the relatively novel grouped format in this study.</abstract>', '<title>Running Memory for Clinical Handoffs: A Look at Active and Passive Processing</title> <abstract>Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of domain-relevant expertise on running memory and the ability to process handoffs of information. In addition, the role of active or passive processing was examined. Background: Currently, there is little research that addresses how individuals with different levels of expertise process information in running memory when the information is needed to perform a real-world task. Method: Three groups of participants differing in their level of clinical expertise (novice, intermediate, and expert) performed an abstract running memory span task and two tasks resembling real-world activities, a clinical handoff task and an air traffic control (ATC) handoff task. For all tasks, list length and the amount of information to be recalled were manipulated. Results: Regarding processing strategy, all participants used passive processing for the running memory span and ATC tasks. The novices also used passive processing for the clinical task. The experts, however, appeared to use more active processing, and the intermediates fell in between. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicated that individuals with clinical expertise and a developed mental model rely more on active processing of incoming information for the clinical task while individuals with little or no knowledge rely on passive processing.

A total of 198 civil aviation pilots and 804 other civil aviation practitioners were recruited to complete surveys on mindfulness, SCL-90, job burnout, core self-evaluation, and psychological resilience. The network relationship between trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation was constructed. The results showed that trait mindfulness played an important role in the psychological adaptation network of civil aviation employees. Specifically, trait mindfulness was negatively correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and emotional exhaustion, and positively correlated with core self-evaluation. However, no significant difference was found in trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation network between pilots and non-pilots. These findings show that mindfulness has a unique positive effect on the psychological adaptation of civil aviation personnel. Specifically, the mindfulness trait may alleviate compulsive symptoms or reduce emotional exhaustion, enabling airline personnel to maintain a good self-evaluation.

Drawing upon self-determination theory, this study examines whether, how, and when the sense of calling influences pilot safety behavior from the perspective of occupational psychology. Using a sample of 321 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between sense of calling and pilot safety behavior was mediated by harmonious safety passion and moderated by safety climate. The results indicated that the sense of calling had a positive direct effect on pilot safety behavior and that this relationship was partially mediated by harmonious safety passion. Moreover, safety climate negatively moderates the positive relationship between sense of calling and harmonious safety passion as well as the indirect effect of sense of calling on safety behavior via harmonious safety passion. In particular, sense of calling had a stronger effect on harmonious safety passion and a stronger indirect effect on safety behavior when the safety climate was lower.

Findings: The results show that trust in an organization and trait mindfulness are negatively associated with the perceived stress of flight attendants. Their associations are also partially mediated by optimism. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis reveals that trait mindfulness intensifies the positive association between trust in organizations and optimism.

Furthermore, leader–member exchange (LMX) strengthens relationships between two dimensions of safety climate and pilots’ safety knowledge and motivation acquisitions. © 2025 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).</abstract>']"

In addition, there is scattered epidemiologic evidence and considerable clinical support that disturbed or inadequate sleep may be a risk factor for clinical emergence of cardiovascular disease and for total mortality. The role of sleep problems both as a precursor and as a sequela of disease states could be better delineated in large groups by the availability of a brief, reliable and standardized scale for sleep disturbance. Such a scale could also be used to evaluate the impact of different therapies upon sleep problems. This paper presents data from two study populations responding to three and four item self-report scales. From 9 to 12% of air traffic controllers reported various sleep problems to have occurred on half or more of the days during the prior month, whereas 12-22% of patients 6 months after cardiac surgery reported such frequent sleep problems. Utilizing data from the 6 and 12 month follow-ups, test-retest reliability of the three-item scale in cardiac surgery patients was found to be 0.59. Internal consistency coefficients for the three and four-item scales were 0.63 and 0.79 respectively. © 1988.</abstract>', '<title>Impossible meals? The food and meal situation of flight attendants in Scandinavia – A qualitative interview study</title> <abstract>The working conditions of flight attendants (FAs) often involve extended and irregular working hours, short rest periods, difficulties in planning for breaks and high demands of service provision. Moreover, work schedules including early check-in, shifts during circadian low and time-zone transitions imply constant exposure to alterations in circadian systems and related health risks. The aim of this explorative study was to investigate how the organisation of work, time and place influence the food and meal situation of FAs when at work, focusing on patterns, form and social context of meals. The research questions posed were how food and meals at work were characterised and perceived among the FAs, and what strategies were adopted to manage the food and meal situation. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen FAs working in Scandinavia. The results indicated that the organisation of work, time and place have a major influence on the meal situation at work, and how food and meals are perceived and managed by FAs. The work was defined as fragmented and inconsistent regarding time and place resulting in scattered meals and a more snack-based form of eating. The meal situation was characterised by irregularity as well as unpredictability. Eating took place when food was available and when there was enough time to eat, rather than being guided by hunger or social context. Various strategies such as eating in prevention, using emergency food, avoiding certain food and drinks or eating little or nothing at all were used to manage the unpredictability of the meal situation as well as the gap between organisational and individual times. The findings demonstrated the individual responsibility to solve the meal at work, e.g. to solve organisational times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Dietary Rhythmicity and Mental Health Among Airline Personnel</title> <abstract>IMPORTANCE Misaligned dietary rhythmicity has been associated with metabolic diseases; however, its association with mental health remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between dietary rhythms and the mental health condition of shift workers, specifically airline crew members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected from the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China, an ongoing large-scale health survey of pilots, flight attendants, and air security officers employed by major airline companies in China. Participants aged 18 to 60 years were invited through text messages to complete a web-based survey. The data collection period was December 2022 to March 2023. Statistical analysis was performed from July 24, 2023, to April 12, 2024. EXPOSURE Data on timing of breakfast and dinner on workdays and rest days, daily time windows for food intake, and meal and eating jet lags were collected and calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the associations of anxiety and depression with meal timing, eating window time, meal jet lag (ie, delayed meals), and eating jet lag (ie, delayed eating). All models were adjusted for individual socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS Of the 22 617 participants (median [IQR] age, 29.1 [26.3-33.7] years; 13 712 males [60.6%]), 1755 (7.8%) had anxiety and 2768 (12.2%) had depression. After controlling for confounding factors, having dinner after 8 PM on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.05) and depression (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.78-2.27), compared with consuming dinner before 8 PM. Similar results were observed on night-shift days and rest days. An eating window of less than 12 hours was associated with reduced odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) and depression (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89) on morning-shift days; the results remained significant on rest days. Delayed dinner on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54) and depression (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). On night-shift days, delayed dinner was associated with higher odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and depression (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36). On morning-shift days, delayed eating rhythms were associated with higher odds of depression (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.61), whereas advanced eating rhythms were associated with lower odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that meal timing, long eating window, and meal jet lags were associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the need for interventions and supportive policies that help mitigate the adverse implications of shift work and irregular working hours for the mental health of shift workers. © 2024 American Medical Association.

This study aimed to explore the effects of sleep problems on depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese commercial pilots. Methods: Adults who participated in the baseline assessment of the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China between December 2022 and March 2023 formed the study sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed using standardized scales. Sleep duration was measured with standardized questions. Logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to analyze the association between sleep problems and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 7055 pilots were included in this study. The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety among pilots was 23.3% (n = 1642; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.3%–24.3%) and 17.0% (n = 1196; 95% CI = 16.1–17.8%), respectively. Logistic regression analyses revealed that short sleep duration (<7 h) was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.491; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 2.555; p < 0.001), while poor sleep quality was also associated with a higher risk of depression (OR = 7.297; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 7.469; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, there was an inverse, J-shaped nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and both depression (inflection point: 7.64 h) and anxiety (inflection point: 7.48 h). Similarly, a J-shaped nonlinear relationship was found between sleep quality and depression/anxiety with an inflection point of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) = 4 points for both. The major limitation of the study was that causal relationships between variables could not be inferred due to the cross-sectional study design. Conclusion: This study found that depression and anxiety were common among Chinese commercial pilots. Insufficient length and poor quality of sleep were associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Implementing targeted strategies to improve sleep patterns is crucial for reducing the risk of depression and anxiety in this population. © © 2024 Pan Chen et al.</abstract>', '<title>Occupational risk factors for sleep quality among Serbian airline pilots</title> <abstract>Introduction: The ability of airline pilots to maintain a good level of sleep goes a long way in ensuring operational effectiveness with regard to safety as well as personal health. The study assesses the risk factors for sleep quality of airline pilots in Serbia with the objective of determining those factors, both occupational and lifestyle that are paramount in assisting with sleep health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 66 Serbian commercial pilots, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess their sleep quality. Demographic, occupational, lifestyle, biological and psychological variables were obtained through validated questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥5). Results: Overall sleep quality was poor in 65.2% of the participants. Significant factors associated with poor sleep quality included years of experience (OR\u202f=\u202f1.17, p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and levels of stress (OR\u202f=\u202f2.87, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Particular lifestyle variables, including factors such as coffee intake, had initial relationships with sleep quality but were not significant in the multivariate models. With regard to age, a significant univariate association was also revealed but was dropped in the final model because of collinearity with years of experience. Conclusion: Serbian commercial pilots have a relatively high risk of inadequate sleep associated with years of experience and levels of stress. There is a need to implement organization-wide changes such as stress management schemes in order to improve sleep quality among pilots, and foster prioritizing well-being. © © 2025 Stojanović, Nesic, Maksimović, Terzić-Šupić, Todorović, Topalović, Vlaisavljević and Ilić Živojinović.</abstract>']"

In two experiments, participants made rapid judgements about the number of items present in a visual display. Within each display, items were grouped into a canonical representation (e.g., triangle, square, and pentagon) or were arranged linearly. In both experiments, grouping information facilitated enumeration performance, replicating previous findings in the literature. In Experiment 2, the facilitative effect of grouping information was found to be greater for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) than for matched novices, though they were no better than novices on linear arrays. This may be because linear, like canonical arrays, hold unique numerosity information, but only when they contain the minimum number of points necessary to define a line (i.e., 2). So ATCs' performance on linear arrays containing more than two items does not benefit from a facilitative effect of grouping information. That their experience of being ATCs, in terms of years served, was shown to account for the expertise effect suggests that such visuospatial expertise is acquired through frequent exposure to spatial arrays. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Forty-eight subjects performed the monitoring task under relatively high taskload conditions for 2h. Two types of critical events were employed. Simple events consisted of a readily detectible alphanumeric change; complex events (detection of two aircraft at the same altitude on the same flight path) required considerable information processing for detection. Behaviours following detection of each type of event enabled acquisition of data on short-term memory, decision time and errors, procedural errors, and motor movement time. Time to detect aircraft at the same altitude was found to increase significantly over the 2 h as did failures to detect these events; detection time for the simpler type of event showed no evidence of impairment, nor was any impairment found for any of the other task behaviours that were measured. The results are discussed with reference to previous studies which suggest that the extent to which attentional decline impairs complex monitoring performance may be related to the amount of information processing required for event detection. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Linking task analysis to information relevance</title> <abstract>Objective: The main objective of this study is to present a methodology for computing information relevance. Background: Relevance is a pervasive term used in several domains, such as pragmatics, information science, and psychology. Quantifying the relevance of information can be helpful in effective display design. Displays should be designed so that the more relevant information is more easily accessed. Method: This procedure focuses on computing the relevance of a piece of information by taking into account three aspects of tasks that use the information: the number of different tasks that make use of the information, the frequency of occurrence of those tasks, and the criticality of those tasks. The methodology can be used to compute the aggregate relevance of a piece of information for a particular component of a system or for the entire system. This methodology was illustrated using the domain of air traffic control (ATC). Results: In support of the validity of the methodology, we were able to confirm the value of weather information and traffic information in ATC towers. Conclusion: The method can be used to derive information relevance, a characteristic of information that has implications for display design for any domain. Application: Designers can use information about aggregate relevance to design information displays that feature the most relevant information.

Disability data were taken from a 1978 U.S. health interview survey (n = 9855). Expert ratings of job activities (dimensions) were obtained from a job analysis database (n = 2485 occupations). The two databases were merged such that job dimension data were imputed to each occupation in the disability database. Odds ratios for cardiovascular disability were calculated for scores in the second, third, and fourth quartiles for each of the 32 job dimensions, using scores in the first quartile as the standard. Job dimensions associated with cardiovascular disability were (a) hazardous situations; (b) vigilant work and responsibility for others; (c) exchanging job-related information; and (d) attention to devices. Occupations identified with high scores on these job dimensions included transportation jobs (air traffic controllers, airline pilots and attendants, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), teachers (preschool, adult education), and craftsmen/foremen (machinists, carpenters, and foremen). © 1991.</abstract>', '<title>Cardiovascular changes at work: Relation with some individual risk factors</title> <abstract>Heart rate (HR) acceleration during work which is accepted as a main cardiovascular response to stress could be influenced not only by the work itself but also by some behavioural variables. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of several individual characteristics (age, body mass index, arterial blood pressure, Vo2max, leisure time physical activity, Type A behavior and neuroticism) on HR reactivity during work and rest. Sixty-nine male subjects practising several occupations (air traffic controllers, railway station controllers, managers, chemical operators, etc.) participated in the study. The common characteristic of all jobs was the presence of neuro-emotional strain of various degrees. The ECG Holter Medilog 4500 system was used for monitoring the HR during the working day. The HR at work was applied as a single dependent variable in the multiple regression analysis and the independent contribution of the following variables was evaluated: HR at rest, neuroticism and Type A behaviour pattern. They appeared to be the most significant determinants in this model and explained about 23% of the variation in HR during work. As second-rank predictors, age and leisure time physical activity led to a non-essential increase (up to 25%) of the multiple regression coefficient. In order to reduce the risk effects of health-related behaviours and individual patterns on the cardiovascular system it is recommended that a preventive approach based on behavioural modification should be adopted. © Freund Publishing House Ltd.</abstract>', '<title>Cardiovascular reactivity to work stress predicts subsequent onset of hypertension: The air traffic controller health change study</title> <abstract>Objective: The hypothesis that increased blood pressure reactivity to stress is an early risk marker of hypertension was tested in a 1994 follow-up of the 1974 to 1978 Air Traffic Controller Health Change Study sample. Methods: Assessments in 1974 to 1978 included physical examinations and recordings (every 20 minutes for 5 hours) of both workload (planes within controller airspace) and blood pressure reactivity. Individual differences in reactivity were used to predict 1994 self-report of ever having been told by a physician to take antihypertensive medication, assessed in a telephone survey of 218 respondents who were normotensive or stage 1 hypertensive in 1974 to 1978. Results: Each SD increase in baseline systolic reactivity was associated with a 1.7 (p < .019) increase in the relative-odds of 1994 hypertension, after controlling for age, body mass index, and clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure at clinical examination, with effects comparable for baseline normotensives and stage I hypertensives.

Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the use of PMR program in ATC by developing a model using biomarkers (saliva) tested on the cocorometer stress diagnostic tool and validity, including observing related determinants in the work environment. Methods: A quasi-experimental method was used, focusing on one group pre-post-test design for 92 respondents across six research areas in Indonesia. All respondents had received training in PMR methods conducted by psychologists. Subsequently, ongoing assistance was provided in implementing relaxation by a trained reminder team for eight weeks to maintain the precision and effectiveness of the intervention. Further analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the success of the intervention. Results: The implementation of PMR program in ATC reduced the incidence of stress levels after the observation. Statistically, the feeling of fatigue was a significant variable that decreased in mean value after the implementation of the relaxation program on the data review.

The novice nurse's contributions to the patient's care lie in her ability to manage expected behavioral responses to the CCU experience even with a basic working knowledge of normal sinus rhythm and CPR procedure. The expected responses to the CCU experience discussed are: anxiety, denial, depression, and aggressive sexual behaviour. These usual behavioral responses have, at times, been referred to as 'a disease of medical progress' or the so-called 'intensive care syndrome'. The nurse is in a key position to observe the patient's behavioral responses since she spends most of the time with the patient. When these behavioral patterns are considered as part of a normal pattern of adaption, the nurse can utilize these for effective management of the patient's hospitalization experience as well as an indicator to the patient standpoint in his process of adaption.

This study widens the scope of research from teams to MTS and empirically compares the mechanisms involved in speaking up within versus across teams in ad hoc MTS-aircrews. In a sample of 1490 aircrew members of a European airline, we found that crewmembers' individual level perceptions of psychological safety mediated both the relationship between status and speaking up and between perceived leader inclusiveness and speaking up within teams. Across teams, however, psychological safety and leader inclusiveness-as perceived by pursers in their role as boundary spanners-showed no effect. Instead, it was pursers' within-team perceptions of psychological safety that mediated between status and speaking up across teams. Teams in ad hoc MTS may thus serve as safe harbours supporting their members also in interactions across team boundaries.

This mechanism also identifies ethical leadership and traditionality as two moderators. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data from 621 flight attendants in Chinese private commercial airline companies. PLS-SEM (partial least square structured equation modeling) is used to examine the hypotheses proposed in the present study. Results: After data analysis, the results reveal that the underlying mechanism covering both mediating and moderating effects through which flight attendants’ voluntary and extra-role safety behavior could be improved. Discussion: The findings extend the existing literature regarding the antecedents of flight attendants’ mindful safety practices adoption and obstacles to employee voice participation.

Trust is considered as a mechanism for facilitating the effects of a leader on employee citizenship behaviors. Increasingly research has focused on the role of trust in a safety context; however, the role of coworker trust has been overlooked. OBJECTIVES: The mediating role of coworker trust in the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior is the focus of this field study. METHODS: Front-line employees from an air traffic control center and an airline maintenance department completed surveys measuring leader-member exchange, co-worker trust, and safety citizenship behavior. RESULTS: Structural Equation Modeling revealed affective and cognitive trust in coworkers is influenced by leader-member exchange. A trust-based mediation model where cognitive trust and affective trust mediate the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior emerged. CONCLUSION: Results of this study add to our understanding of the relationship between leader-member exchange and safety behavior. The effect of co-worker trust and the extent to which employees participate in workplace safety practice were identified as critical factors. The findings show that managers need to focus on developing cognitive and affective coworker trust to improve safety citizenship behaviors. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.</abstract>']"

Intracranial and paranasal imaging studies reveal no abnormalities. The etiology is still uncertain, although sinus barotrauma has been proposed as a possible mechanism. Case Reports: 1) A 26-yr-old woman presented with recurring headache during each air travel since she was 22 yr old. Severe bursting pain suddenly manifested in the bilateral orbits and temples during airplane descent, with no accompanying additional symptoms. She had no unusual medical history. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans showed no abnormalities except thickening of the nasal mucosa. Effective pain relief was obtained with over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray. 2) A 49-yr-old man presented with a 3-yr history of flight-related headache that appeared at airplane touchdown, when he had mental stress, or when he was suffering from a lack of sleep. Pain was of a severe jabbing quality, localized over the forehead with no additional accompanying symptoms. He had a past history of episodic tension-type headache. Intracranial and paranasal CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Headache ceased spontaneously within 40 min of the end of the flight and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug premedication did not prevent the headache. Discussion: Sinus barotrauma was thought to be a plausible explanation for the headache in Case 1. In Case 2, an anxiety disorder could be considered as an underlying etiology. The etiology of so-called airplane headache is probably protean and this should be taken into account when assessing cases of in-flight cephalalgia. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>A case of penetrating head wound due to helicopter rotor blade injury in a 34-year-old naval helicopter pilot who returned to active service 5 years later</title> <abstract>Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Head trauma, defined as damage to the brain, skull, or scalp when the head is hit by an external force, is a major cause of mortality in military personnel. Therefore, we report a novel case involving a naval helicopter pilot who sustained a helicopter propeller rotor blade injury. Case Report: We describe a case involving a pilot struck on the head by a helicopter rotor blade. He received care from medical staff shortly after the injury and was en route to the nearest trauma center. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a comminuted fracture of the right occipital bone, with bone fragment retention in the right cerebral hemispheres. We performed an emergency right occipital craniotomy. The visual field patterns demonstrated right homonymous hemianopia when the patient was discharged. The patient underwent delayed titanium mesh cranioplasty about 3 months after the right occipital craniotomy. From discharge to 5 years, the patient had performed rehabilitation exercise for at least 3 days every week. The patient’s continued recovery was confirmed at the 5-year follow-up in 2019. The bilateral visual acuity was 20/20, and the right homonymous hemianopia problem also disappeared. In the same year, after a physical and psychological assessment by an aviation doctor, he was able to resume flying. Conclusions: This report has shown that despite safety regulations for military and civilian helicopter personnel, which include the wearing of helmets, helicopter rotor blade injuries still occur and can have long-term consequences due to the severity of head injury. © 2021, International Scientific Information, Inc..

Decompression illness (either venous or arterial) and environmental conditions (e.g., abnormal gases and pressure) are the most likely adverse effects aircrew often face. Though symptomatic aircrew personnel may occasionally require hyperbaric oxygen treatment, it is rare to require more than one treatment before returning to baseline function. Case Report: This challenging aviation case details the clinical course and discusses the salient physiological factors of an F/A-18D pilot who presented with neurological symptoms following loss of cabin pressure at altitude. Discussion: Most crucial to this discussion was the requirement for multiple hyperbaric oxygen treatments over several days due to recurrence of symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence during and after future flights cannot be estimated with accuracy. This case illustrates a degree of recurrences for neurological symptoms in aviation (hypobaric exposure to hyperbaric baseline environment) that has not previously been described. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

Low probability of need satisfaction leads to negative emotions, actively minimized by the subject. Increased probability of satisfaction, as compared to earlier forecast, generates positive emotions, which the subject tries to maximize, i.e. to enhance, to prolong, to repeat. The informational theory of emotions encompasses their reflective function, the laws of their appearance, the regulatory significance of emotions, and their role in organization of behavior. The level of emotional stress influences the operator's performance. A decrease in the emotional tonus leads to drowsiness, lack of vigilance, missing of significant signals and to slower reactions. An extremely high stress level disorganizes the activity, complicates it with a trend toward incorrect actions and reactions to insignificant signals (false alarms).

In order to better understand the effect of stress on cognitive performance, and whether this effect is related to an autonomic response to stress, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used as a testing platform along with a 2-Choice Reaction Time Task. When considering the nature and importance of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) work and the fact that they are subjected to high levels of stress, this study was conducted with a sample of ATCs (n = 11). Linear Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features were extracted from ATCs electrocardiogram (ECG) acquired using a medical-grade wearable ECG device (Vital Jacket® (1-Lead, Biodevices S.A, Matosinhos, Portugal)). Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were also used to measure perceived stress. TSST produced statistically significant changes in some HRV parameters (Average of normal-to-normal intervals (AVNN), Standard Deviation of all NN (SDNN), root mean square of differences between successive rhythm-to-rhythm (RR) intervals (RMSSD), pNN20, and LF/HF) and subjective measures of stress, which recovered after the stress task. Although these short-term changes in HRV showed a tendency to normalize, an impairment on cognitive performance was evident. Despite that participant’s reaction times were lower, the accuracy significantly decreased, presenting more errors after performing the acute stress event.

Poor stress management, besides the lack of skills, can be a direct cause of poor performance under stress, both in the selection process of ATCOs and later in the workplace. 40 ATC candidates, within the final stages of their selection process, underwent a stimulation paradigm for elicitation and assessment of various generic task-unrelated physiological features, related to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), acoustic startle response (ASR) and the physiological allostatic response, which are all recognized as relevant psychophysiological markers of stress resilience. The multimodal approach included analysis of electrocardiography, electromyography, electrodermal activity and respiration.

Subject matter experts were used to generate a scoring key from the alternatives that the experts recommended for a typical GA pilot.

Results from that first study showed that the test had acceptable psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency and distribution. In Study 2, the test was administered to 467 participants over the Internet. Analyses resulted in the reduction of the test to 39 items, with an internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of .747. Construct validation was accomplished through correlation with a measure of the number of times the participant had been involved in an accident or other hazardous aviation event. Pilots who had higher (better) scores on the SJT were found to have experienced fewer hazardous events, which was taken as supporting the construct validity of the test. Evaluation of mode of administration (paper-and-pencil vs. Internet) showed that the 2 forms were equivalent.

These problems render certain research and engineering strategies more effective than others.

The effects of each additional flight sector during the work period was elevated reaction times (RT) both among cabin crewmembers (B = 5.05 ms, 95% CI 0.6, 9.5) and pilots (B = 4.95 ms, 95% CI 0.4, 9.5). Precision was unaffected. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots and cabin crewmembers seem to obtain satisfactory sleep before and during the period of 4 consecutive days. The association between multiple flight sectors and increased fatigue supports previous findings. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Sleep and fatigue differences in the two most common types of commercial flight operations</title> <abstract>Background: Sleep and fatigue management is one of the main challenges in airline operations scheduling. Our aim was to compare the differences regarding fatigue, sleep, and labor specificities between the two most common types of flight, short/medium haul (SM-H) and long haul (L-H), in a large sample of airline pilots. Methods: A self-report questionnaire was developed, composed of socio-economic and labor questions, and psychological assessment scales for fatigue and sleep. Associations of these variables and type of flight were tested. Results: Of the total sample of Portuguese airline pilots (N = 435), 313 (72%) were from SM-H and 122 (28%) were from L-H. For SM-H, the values obtained for sleep complaints were 34.2%, daytime sleepiness 61.6%, and fatigue 93.0%. For L-H, 36.9%, 53.3%, and 84.4%, respectively. Looking at labor variables, the differences between the two types of flights were evident, with SM-H pilots' having statistically significant higher mean values of duty and flight hours, numbers of sectors, and early mornings. Only the mean number of night periods was higher in L-H pilots. All values were reported for 28 consecutive scheduling days. Conclusion: Night periods and time-zone crossing may explain higher prevalence levels of sleep disturbances in L-H pilots. However, the values for daytime sleepiness were higher in SM-H pilots, which may be attributed to diminished sleep caused by a combination of frequent early starts and long duty periods. Taking into account the large differences between the two types of flights, different regulatory limits should be considered by aviation authorities. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"", '<title>Two-crew operations: Stress and fatigue during long-haul night flights</title> <abstract>Background: As part of a research program concerning legal aspects of two-pilot operations on long-haul routes, the purpose of the study was to investigate two-crew extended range operations during a flight roster with two consecutive night flights and a short layover. Hypothesis: Present flight time regulations may not be adequate for two-crew minimum operations. Methods: The study was conducted in cooperation with a German airline company on the route Frankfurt (FRA)-Mahe (SEZ). There were 11 rotations (22 flights) that were investigated by pre-, in- and post-flight data collection each time from the two pilots. Recordings included sleep, taskload, fatigue and stress by measurement of EEG, ECG, motor activity, and subjective ratings. The average actual flight times were 9:15 h (FRA-SEZ) and 9:53 h (SEZ-FRA). All flights took place at night. The layover duration in Mahe was 13:30 h during daytime. Results: During layover, sleep was shortened by 2 h on average compared with 8-h baseline sleep. The two consecutive night duties resulted in a sleep loss of 9.3 h upon return to home base. Inflight ratings of taskload showed moderate grades, but for fatigue ratings an increasing level was observed. Fatigue was more pronounced during the return flight and several pilots scored, their fatigue at a critical level. Motor activity, brainwave activity (occurrences of micro-events) and heart rate indicated drowsiness and a low state of vigilance and alertness during both night flights, but these effects were more pronounced during the second flight. Conclusions: From the findings it is concluded that a duty roster as conducted in this study, may impose excessive demands on mental and physiological capacity.</abstract>']"

The rarity of these alarms associated with their possible unreliability may play a role in this misperception. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we manipulated both audiovisual conflict and sound rarity in a simplified landing task. Behavioral data and event related potentials (ERPs) of thirteen healthy participants were analyzed. We found that the presentation of a rare auditory signal (i.e. an alarm), incongruent with visual information, led to a smaller amplitude of the auditory N100 (i.e. less negative) compared to the condition in which both signals were congruent. Moreover, the incongruity between the visual information and the rare sound did not significantly affect reaction times, suggesting that the rare sound was neglected. We propose that the lower N100 amplitude reflects an early visual-to-auditory gating that depends on the rarity of the sound. In complex aircraft environments, this early effect might be partly responsible for auditory alarm insensitivity. Our results provide a new basis for future aeronautic studies and the development of countermeasures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>', '<title>False alerts in air traffic control conflict alerting system: Is there a ""cry wolf"" effect?</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim is to establish the extent to which the high false-alarm rate of air traffic control midair conflict alerts is responsible for a ""cry wolf"" effect-where true alerts are not responded to and all alerts are delayed in their response. Background: Some aircraft collisions have been partly attributed to the cry wolf effect, and in other domains (health care and systems monitoring), there is a causal connection between false-alarm rate and cry wolf behavior. We hypothesized that a corresponding relationship exists in air traffic control (ATC). Method: Aircraft track and alert system behavior data surrounding 495 conflict alerts were analyzed to identify true and false alerts, trajectory type, and controller behavior. Forty-five percent of the alerts were false, ranging from 0.28 to 0.58. Results: Although centers with more false alerts contributed to more nonresponses, there was no evidence that these were nonresponses to true alerts or that response times were delayed in those centers. Instead, controllers showed desirable anticipatory behavior by issuing trajectory changes prior to the alert. Those trajectory pairs whose conflicts were more difficult to visualize induced more reliance on, and less compliance with, the alerting system. Conclusion: The high false-alarm rate does not appear to induce cry wolf behavior in the context of en route ATC conflict alerts. Application: There is no need to substantially modify conflict alert algorithms, but the conflict alert system may be modified to address difficult-to-visualize conflicts.

Background: Cockpit displays of traffic information (CDTIs) are being designed for use in airplane cockpits as responsibility for safe separation becomes shared between pilots and controllers. Of interest in this work is how characteristics of the alarm system such as threshold, modality, and number of alert levels impact concurrent task (flight control) performance and response to potential conflicts. Methods: Student pilots performed a tracking task analogous to flight control while simultaneously monitoring for air traffic conflicts with the aid of a CDTI alert as the threshold, modality, and level of alert was varied. Results: As the alerting system became more prone to false alerts, pilot compliance decreased and concurrent performance improved. There was some evidence of auditory preemption with auditory alerts as the false alarm rate increased. Finally, there was no benefit to a three-level system over a two-level system. Conclusion: There is justification for increased false alarm rates, as miss-prone systems appear to be costly. The 4:1 false alarm to miss ratio employed here improved accuracy and concurrent task performance. More research needs to address the potential benefits of likelihood alerting. Application: The issues addressed in this research can be applied to any imperfect alerting system such as in aviation, driving, or air traffic control. It is crucial to understand the performance consequences of new technology and the efficacy of potential mitigating design features within the specific context desired.

Such failure of auditory attention is thought to rely on top-down biasing mechanisms at the central executive level. A complementary approach to account for this phenomenon is to consider the existence of visual dominance over hearing that could be implemented via direct visual-to-auditory pathways. To investigate this phenomenon, thirteen aircraft pilots, equipped with a 32-channel EEG system, faced a low and high workload scenarii along with an auditory oddball task in a motion flight simulator. Prior to the flying task, the pilots were screened to assess their working memory span and visual dominance susceptibility. The behavioral results disclosed that the volunteers missed 57.7% of the auditory alarms in the difficult condition. Among all evaluated capabilities, only the visual dominance index was predictive of the miss rate in the difficult scenario. These findings provide behavioral evidences that other early cross-modal competitive process than top down modulation process could account for inattentional deafness. The electrophysiological analyses showed that the miss over the hit alarms led to a significant amplitude reduction of early perceptual (N100) and late attentional (P3a and P3b) event-related potentials components. Eventually, we implemented an EEG-based processing pipeline to perform single-trial classification of inattentional deafness. The results indicate that this processing chain could be used in an ecological setting as it led to 72.2% mean accuracy to discriminate missed from hit auditory alarms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>', '<title>Failure to detect critical auditory alerts in the cockpit: Evidence for inattentional deafness</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether inattentional deafness to critical alarms would be observed in a simulated cockpit. Background: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (e.g., alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking. Method: Twenty-eight general aviation pilots performed two landings in a flight simulator. In one scenario an auditory alert was triggered alone, whereas in the other the auditory alert occurred while the pilots dealt with a critical windshear. Results: In the windshear scenario, 11 pilots (39.3%) did not report or react appropriately to the alarm whereas all the pilots perceived the auditory warning in the no-windshear scenario. Also, of those pilots who were first exposed to the no-windshear scenario and detected the alarm, only three suffered from inattentional deafness in the subsequent windshear scenario. Conclusion: These findings establish inattentional deafness as a cognitive phenomenon that is critical for air safety. Pre-exposure to a critical event triggering an auditory alarm can enhance alarm detection when a similar event is encountered subsequently. Application: Case-based learning is a solution to mitigate auditory alarm misperception. © 2013, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>']"

Methods: Four recent reports of accidents occurring in 1997 in Indonesia, 1999 in Massachusetts in the United States, 2013 in Namibia, and 2015 in France related to commercial aircraft-assisted suicides were analyzed. This analysis relied on data extracted from the accident reports that supported aircraft-assisted suicide from the: (a) cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR), (b) medical history, (c) psychosocial history, (d) toxicology, (e) autopsy, and (f) any methodology that utilized aviation medicine. There are some limitations in this study. Although all analyzed accident investigations followed ICAO Annex 13 guidelines, there is variability in their accident investigations and reporting. In addition, accident investigation reports represent accidents from 1997 to 2015, and during this time, there has been a change in the way accidents are reported. The nature of this analysis is explorative. The aim was to identify how the various aircraft accident investigators concluded that the accidents were due to suicidal acts. Results: In all four accident reports, FDR data were available. CVR data were also available, except for one accident where CVR data were only partially available. Comprehensive medical and psychosocial histories were available in only one of four of the accident reports. Conclusion: To prevent accidents involving commercial aircraft, it is necessary to identify the causes of these accidents to be able to provide meaningful safety recommendations. A detailed psychological autopsy of pilots can and likely will assist in investigations, as well as generate recommendations that will substantially contribute to mitigating accidents due to pilot suicide. Airborne image recording may be a useful tool to provide additional information about events leading up to a crash and thus assist in accident investigations. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>Psychiatry and fitness to fly after Germanwings</title> <abstract>In March 2015, a co-pilot flying Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately pointed his airplane into a descent, killing himself, five other crew members, and 144 passengers. Subsequent investigation and review teams examined the incident and considered potential lessons to maximize air safety. In this article, aviation industry clinical leaders, including the U.S. Federal Air Surgeon and Chief Psychiatrist from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), along with a professional pilot and collaborating forensic psychiatrists, discuss suicide-by-plane, evolving themes related to public safety responsibilities for psychiatrists treating pilots, and forensic trends in pilot evaluation for medical certification from an aerospace psychiatric perspective. We explore how psychiatric aspects of pilot fitness and aviation safety are examined across perspectives, including unsafe acts, preconditions, organizational factors, and unsafe supervision. We explore practices for civilian pilots and offer information related to military pilot fitness. Lessons from Germanwings are presented, as is the need for increased support for pilots who might be concerned about revealing mental health challenges for fear of loss of medical certification and pilot employment.

Aims: To raise professional awareness of its complexities and difficulties and identify areas for developing research. Method: A Crime in Mind seminar was held in London in December 2018, with four expert presentations and discussion. This paper draws on that seminar and supplementary literature. Findings: Homicide/suicide is very difficult to predict and thus prevent. Victims and perpetrators may have a dependency relationship. Better training, especially of general practitioners, may increase the likelihood of detecting signs of despair and delusional ideas. Psychiatrists should be more alert to fixed delusions and homicidal thoughts. Individual assessment and management alone is unlikely to be sufficient. Public health strategies are likely to be important too. Weapons control is vital. Employers of people with great personal responsibility and special access to potentially lethal tools, such as airline pilots, and perhaps clinicians, should have regular, compulsory, mental health checks.

Airline pilots are exposed to psychosocial risks, and they may constitute a population at risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorders. However, mental health remains difficult to assess in this population due to the risk of being declared unfit to fly. Scientific studies on mental disorders in airline pilots are rare, and the results are heterogeneous. To date, no study has been conducted describing anxiety or depressive disorders among European airline pilots. Method: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study using an anonymous online self-questionnaire. Pilots were recruited from the National Union of Airline Pilots between September 1 and October 16, 2022. Findings: Out of the 1,220 pilots surveyed, 25.4% of them suffered from anxiety according to the Hospital and Depression Scale (HAD): 14.4% suspected anxiety disorders and 11.0% confirmed anxiety disorders. Additionally, 13.1% of subjects reported depressive symptoms, including 8.9% suspected depressive disorders and 4.2% confirmed depressive disorders, according to the HAD. More than a third of the sample (40.1%) showed alcohol misuse. Interpretation: This study represents a major advancement in understanding the mental health of European airline pilots. This work highlights the need to implement prevention programs targeting profiles at risk of developing anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

However, systematic research on the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots remains scarce, and the relationship between these symptoms and safety operation behaviors is unclear. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the interrelations among mental symptoms in pilots and to explore how these symptoms are associated with safety operation behaviors. A total of 612 male commercial pilots participated in a cross-sectional survey that assessed nine types of mental symptoms and safety operation behaviors. Descriptive statistics, network analysis, and latent profile analysis were utilized to examine their relationships systematically. The study revealed significant interconnections among mental symptoms in pilots, with obsessive-compulsive symptoms playing a pivotal role in the comorbidity network. Pilots were categorized into three groups based on symptom severity: high-, medium-, and low-level symptom groups. Pilots in the high-level symptom group exhibited significantly poorer safety operation behaviors. Nearly half of the mental symptoms are indirectly linked to safety operation behaviors through comorbidities, and these comorbidities have a direct association with these behaviors. In the low-level symptom group, there was greater integration among safety operation behaviors, whereas the high-level symptom group showed dissociation. In the high-level symptom group, interpersonal communication and cooperation played a key role, while the role of understanding the automated system was weaker, which may be related to compensation mechanisms, automation bias, and blind reliance. This study systematically analyzed the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots and their complex relationship with safety operation behaviors. The findings provide practical insights for airline management to promote pilots’ mental health and enhance aviation safety protocols.

However, research is scarce regarding what promotes and prevents pilots from approaching PPSP. Aims: To investigate if, and in which way, different organizational and individual factors are associated with pilots’ attitudes towards approaching PPSP, and to examine the prevalence of possible cases of depression and anxiety disorders among commercial pilots in Europe. Methods: Data were collected using an anonymous web-based survey (n = 4494), covering pilots’ work conditions, health and flight safety. Logistic regression was used to determine the impact of objective and psychosocial work environment factors, mental health factors, and demographic factors. Results: Key findings were that just culture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97, 3.56), type of employment (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.46, 0.78), minimum guaranteed pay (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.48, 2.65), and symptoms of depression (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.50, 0.76) and anxiety (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54, 0.80) significantly predicted pilots’ attitude towards approaching PPSP. The prevalence of pilots scoring above threshold for possible depression (18%) and anxiety disorders (23%) were determined. Conclusions: Pilot Peer Support in its current form appears to be an insufficient means to facilitate pilots’ mental health help-seeking, but could have an important preventive purpose.

Globally, 350 million people suffer from depression-a common mental disorder. This study provides further information on this important topic regarding mental health especially among female airline pilots. This is the first study to describe airline pilot mental health-with a focus on depression and suicidal thoughts-outside of the information derived from aircraft accident investigations, regulated health examinations, or identifiable self-reports, which are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline companies. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study via an anonymous web-based survey administered between April and December 2015. Pilots were recruited from unions, airline companies, and airports via convenience sampling. Data analysis included calculating absolute number and prevalence of health characteristics and depression scores. Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty seven (52.7%) of the 3485 surveyed pilots completed the survey, with 1866 (53.5%) completing at least half of the survey. 233 (12.6%) of 1848 airline pilots responding to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and 193 (13.5%) of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold-PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10. Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks. We found a significant trend in proportions of depression at higher levels of use of sleep-aid medication (trend test z = 6.74, p < 0.001) and among those experiencing sexual harassment (z = 3.18, p = 0.001) or verbal harassment (z = 6.13, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Hundreds of pilots currently flying are managing depressive symptoms perhaps without the possibility of treatment due to the fear of negative career impacts. This study found 233 (12.6%) airline pilots meeting depression threshold and 75 (4.1%) pilots reporting having suicidal thoughts. Although results have limited generalizability, there are a significant number of active pilots suffering from depressive symptoms. We recommend airline organizations increase support for preventative mental health treatment.

Background: Prior research identified the costs of such 3D perspective hazard displays, presented from an exocentric perspective, because of their ambiguity in presenting spatial relations in an unstructured 3D space. Research also supported the advantage of display overlay, particularly when both databases (traffic and weather) need to be integrated to make hazard avoidance judgments. The two variables had not been examined in conjunction. Method: Seventeen certified flight instructors flew a series of hazard avoidance maneuvers in a part-task simulator, with four displays, created by the combination of 3D versus 2-dimensional (2D) perspective and separate versus overlay hazard formats. Positioning of traffic and weather that would make it necessary to avoid hazards was designed to allow the study of both the strengths of overlay and weaknesses of 3D integration. Results: The data clearly indicated that hazard avoidance was worse with the 3D perspective display, for both traffic and weather hazards, and pointed to ambiguity as the cause. Display overlay was better than separation, but only when the task required consulting both databases. Conclusion: 3D perspective displays are not advised for hazard presentation on the flight deck.

The syllabi for flight training contains little information about specific educational techniques or instructions that may assist the flight instructor in his/her role. Matching the learning style of the student, to that of the teaching style of the educator/instructor has the potential to improve learning outcomes.

Results: The results revealed when the modality in which the feedback was provided matched the preferred learning style of the pilot, improvements in performance resulted. When there was a mismatch between the two, adverse effects were evident for auditory learners only. Conclusion: From a theoretical perspective, the results provide clear evidence of the link between learning and teaching styles. From an applied perspective, these results highlight the potential benefits of aligning teaching and learning styles in flight training. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>The Development and Evaluation of Right Instructors: A Descriptive Survey</title> <abstract>Results from a survey of flight instructors and flight training standards inspectors in Canada indicate that flight instructor training is still highly influenced by traditional methods of instruction, such as rote learning and the mimicking of another instructors patter. The quality of flight instructor training also varies greatly because there is no standardized syllabus for the instructor course. Both flight instructors and inspectors felt that flight instructor training should provide competency in teaching methods and a more thorough understanding of learning and evaluation theories. They also stressed the need for senior instructors who teach the flight instructor course to receive additional training before they are authorized to teach others how to teach because the quality of flight training rests with them. Flight instructors conveyed strong feelings about the methods used by Transport Canada to evaluate their teaching effectiveness. The main objections concerned the use of role playing as a means of assessing the teaching ability of flight instructors and the use of a flight test record to hold flight instructors accountable for the success or failure of their students. By far, the most contentious issue was the flight test record. Because flight instructors are not protected by tenure or a permanent teaching qualification, they saw the evaluation process, based on accountability, not so much as a useful tool for personal improvement, but as an interference or a threat to their livelihood. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

This study investigates the opportunities and challenges associated with backseating in an aircraft when another student is learning to fly. An ethnographic study of a flight school in Australia was conducted via observation and in-depth interviews. The results show opportunities such as learning from common mistakes, recognizing patterns, and reinforcing struggling areas in a stress-free environment, without any extra costs. The reported concerns included weight limits and regulatory issues, student nervousness when observed, and insufficient time to backseat flights. For backseating to be adopted, regulatory ambiguities should be addressed. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>', '<title>Flight Instruction: The Challenge From Situated Cognition</title> <abstract>A primary claim from the field of situated cognition is that learning is ineffective if removed from the context in which the target skills must be deployed. This claim is inconsistent with many of the mainstream approaches to education and cognition. I describe what it means to be situated, and I outline the central issues raised in the literature on situated cognition and situated learning. The ideas outlined here have several implications for the conduct of flight instruction. The most pervasive implications are that current and potential training practices in aviation can create a breach between instruction and practice and can lead to the development of inert skills. A recurrent theme for situated cognition is that there is a self-organizing character to learning. If adequately supported by the design of the workspace and the structure of the training program, this self-organizing character of learning will limit the possibility of a breach between instruction and practice and will ensure development of robust skills. A further implication of the research reviewed here is that the role of aviation specialists in the design of systems and training programs has been too limited for it to be fully effective. I introduce the procedure of participatory design as an alternative approach that may ensure the effectiveness of flight training. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The perceptual process has been modeled as the weighted average of the geometric relations in the scene that provide glide-slope information, with weights being adjusted during the approach to minimize the uncertainty in glide-slope perception. The model suggests that the optimum combination of relations providing glide-slope information is dependent on the range from the runway threshold and that there is a relation between the handling qualities of aircraft or flight simulators and the adjustment of the weights.</abstract>', '<title>An analysis of slant for guidance of landing approaches</title> <abstract>For landing without visual aids, judgment of slant angle from texture gradients may be the primary strategy used by pilots to maintain a constant angle of descent toward a runway aimpoint. A mathematical analysis was undertaken to assess whether 1 or more of the available texture gradients have the properties required to support this strategy. The analysis revealed that texture gradients in themselves could not be useful. A relative gradient proportionalized against size of texture elements could, however, support descent-path control. Although not mathematically invariant, the departures from invariance of these relative gradients are too small to be functionally significant. In addition, relative gradients are sensitive to minimum functionally significant changes in angle of descent, whereas absolute gradients are not. Thus, relative gradients satisfy the formal requirements of an invariant for control of action.</abstract>', '<title>Scene Content and Runway Breadth Effects on Simulated Landing Approaches</title> <abstract>Eight experienced pilots flew landing approaches in a light-aircraft simulator with a computer-generated landing display. Scene content and runway breadth were manipulated. Approaches were lower with reduced scene content and to the narrow runways, and trial-to-trial variability was higher with reduced scene content. There was no significant interaction between scene content and runway breadth. The data were used to evaluate two projective geometry models for prediction of glideslope control during an aircraft approach to landing. These models did not permit an entirely satisfactory account of the data.

Inadequate representation of texture or of ground detail and distortions in judgments of size from near accommodation to a display are two of the factors that have been thought to contribute to these biases. Addition of surface detail and magnification of the display have been suggested as corrective solutions. The research reported here was a preliminary investigation of the effects of factors that might induce biased landing approaches in a simulator and of a procedure for calibrating a simulator to eliminate biases. Scene content, display magnification, runway size, and start point all influenced glideslope control. With an appropriate start point and appropriate runway dimensions, there was a close correspondence between performance in an aircraft and performance in a simulator in which the display magnification had been set at unity and in which a moderate level of scene detail was presented. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction. © 2009 INFORMS.</abstract>', ""<title>Administrative Risk Management for Helicopter Operators</title> <abstract>Everyone who saw the fireball of high technology and humanity mushroom over Florida January 28, 1986, carries its memory. But one person, the NASA manager who gave final approval for the Challenger launch, especially has to feel a sense of grief and responsibility. Caught between the pressure to satisfy politicians, the American people, NASA's launch schedule, and a complicated array of possible system failures, he made a decision that proved fatal. On a much more routine but no less lethal scale, most aviation operations managers are caught between the pressure to run an efficient, lean, and responsive operation and the ever-present possibility that an overlooked or underestimated “O-ring” will fail. In the aviation business, the human element is the weak link or “O-ring” more often than not. As the NASA manager knows only too well, no matter who is the pilot-incommand, the manager who selects the pilot; sets crew standards and duty cycles; and establishes company weather minimums and other operating standards is ultimately responsible for operational safety. This article is intended to provide an easy reference to the operating pitfalls, the human frailties, and the risks associated with managing flight operations. Helicopter air-ambulance operators are used to illustrate specific problems and provide extreme examples. The analysis identifies the inherent risks based on the latest National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident data (NTSB, 1988) and describes techniques that can be used to balance the demands of running a business with the need for maintaining safety. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting the key concerns that should be carefully considered from a risk-management viewpoint. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This was tested in a scenario of an airline accident of uncertain cause, finding that respondents blamed the airline the most among a list of five blamable entities (pilots, mechanics-maintenance-inspectors, the weather, ground crew-air traffic control, and airline). Additionally, based on the virtue theory of ethics and the moral character perspective of blame psychology, it was hypothesized that manipulation of the virtue of the airline (mercenary versus altruistic) would result in less blame assigned to the altruistic airline in a quasi-experiment where the other factor was outcome of the accident (safe landing with a few injuries versus crash with many fatalities). However, the two factors significantly interacted in an unexpected way. The mercenary airline suffering a crash was blamed less than the altruistic airline that crashed, while the mercenary airline that safely landed was blamed more than the altruistic airline that safely landed.

The first experiment showed 12% faster response times when 3-D audio was used compared to mono sound. This was only observed when flight path error information was presented on a visual head-down display. No effect was observed when an auditory error display was used because this enabled pilots to pay more attention to the visual warning displays. In the second experiment, only a visual error display was employed, and the effects of 3-D audio and verbal directional information (e.g., ""up"") were tested.

The performance on several tasks improved when 3-D audio was present, whereas no negative performance effects were found. Furthermore, the frequency of eye movements to the HDD was reduced more than 50% in all 3-D audio conditions. Physiological measures were not affected, indicating that mental effort was the same in all conditions. Only a small reduction in subjective workload in some 3-D audio conditions was observed.

Background: This study follows an earlier study where 59 official safety reports of unsafe missed approach procedure (MAP) events were analyzed. Method: The current study utilized these reports to explore the relations between the aircrew’s specific flight experience (SFE) on the aircraft’s type rating that was involved in the incident and the aircrews’ performance during MAP safety incident. Results: There were significantly more incidents involving CAPs with intermediate level of SFE than incidents involving CAPs with high or low SFE. Furthermore, the interrelation between the SFEs of the CAP and the FO of the same aircrew showed that the number of incidents involving FOs with low SFE was significantly higher than that involving FOs with higher SFE. Furthermore, there were significantly more MAP events when the FO took the role of pilot monitoring compared to pilot flying. Discussion: It is suggested that CAPs with an intermediate SFE might feel that they have sufficient skills to operate the airplane, but in fact, they are not yet skilled enough.

Depression is often underreported, especially when subjects are aware they are reporting on depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether scores on a depression screening tool would vary if it was disguised as a “life stress” questionnaire in a sample of Australian commercial pilots. METHODS: A total of 109 subjects were assigned into either a “Life Stress” survey or a “Depression” survey, both containing the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales depression screening tool among other questions relating to either depression or stress to determine any variation in depression scores. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in which the covert group that completed a “life-stress” survey scored higher average depression scores than the control group completing an overt depression inventory. Prevalence of depression was consistent with the general population, with 25% of pilots meeting the threshold for depression within the control group, and this number increased to 41% when using a covert measure to assess depression.

Methods: This population-based study included 11,111 participants, with 7918 pilots in the training set and 3193 pilots in the external validation set. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Physiological, psychological, and lifestyle factors potentially associated with depressive symptom risk were collected. The optimal predictors for model development were selected using the Boruta algorithm combined with the LASSO method, and a nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression to predict depressive symptoms in pilots. The model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and accuracy measures, such as the Brier score and Spiegelhalter z-test. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to assess the model's clinical utility. Results: A total of 7918 pilots were included in the training set and 3193 were included in the external validation set. Five characteristic indicators were selected based on their significance in the prediction of depressive symptom risk: living status, alcohol drinking, family history of mental health disorder, subjective health, and subjective sleep quality. The model showed acceptable overall discrimination (AUC<inf>train</inf> = 0.836, 95%CI 0.818 to 0.854; AUC<inf>validation</inf> = 0.840, 95%CI 0.811 to 0.868) and calibration (Brier score<inf>train</inf> = 0.048; Brier score<inf>validation</inf> = 0.051). The decision curve analysis showed that the net benefit was superior to intervening on all participants or not intervening on all participants. Conclusions: This study provides a reliable tool for early prediction and customized management of depressive symptoms among commercial airline pilots. This approach promotes the development of the field by transitioning from passive mental health care to active mental health prevention, emphasizing personalized prevention strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2025.</abstract>"", ""<title>Psychological distress in Spanish airline pilots during the aviation crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and psychometric analysis of the 12-item general health questionnaire</title> <abstract>The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress of Spanish airline pilots, a group of professionals undergoing an unprecedented work situation as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. To do so, we administered the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). A total of 342 questionnaires were obtained, with the largest respondent age group being 41–50 years. The psychometric properties of the instrument were also evaluated, with an exploratory factor analysis revealing a unidimensional structure that explained 59.23% of the variance. The total score on the standard GHQ-12 was 4.54 ± 3.31 very close to the cut-off point established to determine psychological distress. The score increased among those unemployed and was also higher among pilots on furlough compared to those whose work situation was relatively normal. Furthermore, the reliability measured by the total Cronbach's alpha was above 0.8 of each across all employment status considered. These results show the desirability of conducting periodic psychological distress assessments of pilots so that effective measures can be implemented to ensure their psychological and socio-emotional well-being. Practitioner summary: This article evaluates psychological distress in a group of professionals that has received scant attention in the field. Moreover, it does so against the background of an atypical situation, evaluating the psychological distress suffered by pilots in different employment categories during the current severe crisis in the aviation sector.

Methods: A total of 88 participants (36 aerospace engineers and 52 undergraduate psychology students) participated in this experiment performing a standard drug-related contingency judgment task (with a fictitious drug that could be effective for a fictitious disease) and a novel analogue task with aerospace content. In both tasks, there was a null contingency between treatment and recovery. However, the chance of spontaneous recovery was 70%, a baseline rate which tends to produce strong illusion of control effects in null contingency setups. The participants were tasked to identify the treatment effectivity (the normative answer was no effectivity at all).

For instance, different reliance on proactive versus reactive control strategies could explain inter-individual variability. In particular, specific life experiences, like a highly demanding training for future Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs), could modulate cognitive control functions. A group of ATC trainees and a matched group of university students were tested longitudinally on task-switching and Stroop paradigms that allowed us to measure indices of cognitive control. The results showed that the ATCs, with respect to the control group, had substantially smaller mixing costs during long cue-target intervals (CTI) and a reduced Stroop interference effect. However, this advantage was present also prior to the training phase. Being more capable in managing multiple task sets and less distracted by interfering events suggests a more efficient selection and maintenance of task relevant information as an inherent characteristic of the ATC group, associated with proactive control. Critically, the training that the ATCs underwent improved their accuracy in general and reduced response time switching costs during short CTIs only. These results indicate a training-induced change in reactive control, which is described as a transient process in charge of stimulus-driven task detection and resolution. This experience-based enhancement of reactive control strategy denotes how cognitive control and executive functions in general can be shaped by real-life training and underlines the importance of experience in explaining inter-individual variability in cognitive functioning. © 2016 Arbula et al.

Background: Error-encouragement training is said to be more effective than error-avoidance training because active exploration and error encouragement promote better learning and transfer. Past research, which is limited by confounded experimental designs involving simple tasks with little consideration of individual differences, provides evidence for the value of active exploration but less so for error encouragement. Method: We randomly allocated 164 participants to receive error-encouragement, error-avoidance, or no error-related instructions in training on ATC-lab, a dynamic computer simulated air traffic control task. Active exploration and task information were controlled, and ability and personality were assessed. Results: Error encouragement yielded better transfer performance than did error avoidance but was no better than the control training. Higher- rather than lower-ability trainees benefited from training with an error orientation (positive or negative), suggesting that learning from errors in training requires greater cognitive resources. Trainees higher in openness to experience and agreeableness performed more poorly with error-avoidance training than with error-encouragement and control training. Conclusion: Error-avoidance training had a detrimental effect especially for those less open to experience, lower in agreeableness, and of lower ability. The significant benefits of error-encouragement training reported in previous research were probably attributable to confounding factors, such as active exploration and differential task information. Application: Although errors and active exploration can be useful learning tools in training, trainers should be mindful that focusing on errors, whether positively or negatively, may not suit everyone.

Air traffic control is one of the most sensitive and important jobs in the field of flight safety. Working in such a context requires the use of high levels of cognitive functions, which can be impaired or reduced in speed and accuracy under pressure and stress. Another issue is that cognitive functions interact with non-cognitive factors, one of which is personality traits. Through using a causal-comparative method, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive functions like situational awareness, short-term memory, sustained attention and planning ability, and personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and adventurousness, on air traffic controllers’ human error by controlling the effect of age. For this purpose, five tests were selected from the Vienna Test System, namely MR, CORSI, DAUF, TOL-F, and EPP6, to measure controllers’ cognitive functions and personality traits. By convenience sampling, 37 controllers from the air control center participated in the tests. Excluding outliers, the groups were as follows: 16 controllers with error history and 15 controllers without error history. To control the effect of age on cognitive functions and personality traits, the groups’ data were compared using the covariance analysis. According to the results, there is a difference between groups in situational awareness (sig = 0.008, P ≤ 0.05) and sustained attention (sig = 0.01, P ≤ 0.05), with error-free controllers showing higher scores in these functions. However, in other cognitive functions that were studied, namely short-term memory (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05) and planning ability (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05), no difference was shown between the two groups. Moreover, the study of personality traits showed that controllers with errors differ from controllers without errors (sig = 0.02, P ≤ 0.05), but in emotionality (sig = 0.7, P ≤ 0.05) and adventurousness (sig = 0.6, P ≤ 0.05) there are no differences between the two groups. With these results in mind, efforts can be made to minimize potential errors in sensitive occupations such as air traffic control by using cognitive and personality screening tools. © 2021</abstract>']"

Incorporating psychological, medical, and communication tools as well as aviation subject matter experts are imperative when building an effective education training program. Being able to quantify and demonstrate the level of knowledge needed in a peer with practical application is crucial in the foundation development.

This was initially aimed at pilots and formed part of the recommendations made after the pilot murder-suicide crash of Germanwings flight 9525 in March 2015. Pilot peer support is now considered vital in supporting crew well-being and in promoting aviation safety, alongside other initiatives (Federal Aviation Administration, 2024). To date, there has been scant published literature on the provision of pilot peer support beyond the rationale for its inception. This In Practice paper offers guidance for a competency-based framework for training and benchmarking pilot peers and draws on the familiar framework to pilots of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) pilot competencies (ICAO, 2013). This conceptualization of peer competencies offers a framework for pilot peers in the acquisition of core peer support skills, and for those training pilot peers, a yardstick by which skills acquisition can be assessed. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>', '<title>The Role of Peer Support and Its Contribution as an Effective Response to Addressing the Emotional Well-Being of Pilots: A Qualitative Study of South African Stakeholders</title> <abstract>The provision of pilot peer support in commercial aviation is a recent recommendation following the Germanwings pilot suicide?murder crash in 2015. Conducted in a South African aviation context, this study explored the phenomenon of peer support and its role and contribution as an effective response to addressing the emotional well-being of pilots. A qualitative phenomenological research design was followed using Rubin and Rubin?s in-depth, semi-structured interview technique to understand lived experiences of peer support. Nine interviews were held, six with airline pilots - a combination of peers and flight operations managers - and three with mental health professionals (MHPs). Braun and Clarke?s thematic analysis (TA) method elicited themes in relation to peer support and the mental health and well-being of pilots. Four themes emerged relating to (a) the conceptualization of peer support, the role of the peer, and the principles on which the process is founded; (b) pilots? experience of their workplace as emotionally ""unsafe"" and deficient in acknowledging the nature of different emotional stressors; (c) the well-being of pilots and medical certification of fitness for duty; and (d) the multidimensional contribution of peer support and factors critical to integrating successful and sustainable peer support. This study underscores the importance of developing a more integrated definition of safety in aviation that incorporates supporting the mental health and well-being of pilots.

Screening tools for mental health risks in airline pilots are needed. There is growing interest in pilot peer-support programs and how to incorporate them in a just culture, meaning that pilots can report mental health complaints without a risk of job or income loss. We combined findings from aviation accidents and incidents with a search of scientific literature to provide data-based recommendations for screening, peer-support, and a just culture approach to mental health problems. METHODS: Commercial aviation accidents and incidents in which a mental disorder of a pilot was thought to play a role were reviewed. Subsequently, PubMed and PsychInfo literature searches were performed on peer-support programs, just culture human resource management, and the risk of negative life events on developing suicidal ideation and behavior in comparable professional groups. RESULTS: Lethal accidents were mostly related to impaired coping with negative life events. Negative life events are clearly related to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completed suicide. A protective effect of peer-support programs on mental health problems has not been established, although peer-support programs are generally appreciated by those involved. We did not find relevant literature on just culture. DISCUSSION: Negative life events are likely a useful screening tool for mental health risks. There is still a lack of evidence on how peer-support groups should be designed and how management of mental health risks can be implemented in a just culture. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

Background: Various research results show variability between different generations’ abilities and achievements. It is unclear what differences emerge during the selection process to aircraft piloting studies. Methods: The admission process to aircraft piloting studies involves selecting the most capable young people between 18 and 20 years of age who have completed their secondary education and demonstrate that they possess the required abilities for such studies. Results: The tasks of the selection process are divided into four factors with the help of exploratory factor analysis–Initial information processing, 3D perception, 2D perception, and Level of analysis.

The results indicate that technology has a significant influence on the abilities of the candidates. Conclusions: Generation Y representatives excel in concentration and logical thinking, making fewer errors in such tasks. However, they demonstrate weaker performance in spatial thinking tasks.

The relationship of chronological age to self-rated changes in cognition has been studied extensively. However, the relationship of these changes to age-related changes in piloting skills is not well understood. Objective: This study aims to determine whether airline pilots report age-related changes in cognitive abilities, and whether these changes are related to self-rated changes in piloting skills. Methods: A total of 1310 airline pilots (28-59 yr, mean age = 45.5 yr; mean total flight time = 11,992 h) currently employed by a major U.S. commercial air carrier participated in the study. A 13-item Aviation Experience Survey (AES) was completed by each pilot, using 5-point Likert ratings and yes/no responses comparing current cognitive abilities (e.g., concentration, reaction speed) and piloting skills (e.g., piloting in adverse weather, decision making while flying) with those of 10 yr ago. Results: Cognitive abilities and piloting skills were more likely to be rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" than 10 yr ago by pilots age 39 or under than by pilots in their 40s and 50s, who were more likely to rate their abilities and skills as ""the same."" Fewer than 20% of pilots in any age group rated their cognitive abilities or piloting skills as ""worse"" or ""much worse"" than 10 yr ago. Pilots who reported more anxiety or stress while flying reported more negative changes in abilities, skills, and health status regardless of age. Conclusions: Self-ratings of cognition and piloting skills vary by age, but older pilots are not more likely to report negative changes in their abilities and skills than younger pilots. Further research is needed to verify whether these self-appraisals reflect true changes in skills over time.</abstract>', '<title>Initial cognitive performance predicts longitudinal aviator performance</title> <abstract>Objectives. The goal of the study was to improve prediction of longitudinal flight simulator performance by studying cognitive factors that may moderate the influence of chronological age. Method. We examined age-related change in aviation performance in aircraft pilots in relation to baseline cognitive ability measures and aviation expertise. Participants were aircraft pilots (N = 276) aged 40-77.9. Flight simulator performance and cognition were tested yearly; there were an average of 4.3 (± 2.7; range 1-13) data points per participant. Each participant was classified into one of the three levels of aviation expertise based on Federal Aviation Administration pilot proficiency ratings: least, moderate, or high expertise. Results. Addition of measures of cognitive processing speed and executive function to a model of age-related change in aviation performance significantly improved the model. Processing speed and executive function performance interacted such that the slowest rate of decline in flight simulator performance was found in aviators with the highest scores on tests of these abilities. Expertise was beneficial to pilots across the age range studied; however, expertise did not show evidence of reducing the effect of age. Discussion.

The assessment included tests of psychomotor speed, information processing speed, attention and executive ability, verbal learning and memory, and visual learning and memory. Pilot age was between 28 and 62 with a mean age of 48 years. Test performance was regressed on pilot age to determine the function (linear or nonlinear) of age-related differences in cognition. Individual performance was also examined by assessing outlier test scores (> 2 SD) relative to the overall group mean. Age was significantly associated with test performance across several domains; when significant, a linear function best described the association. Pilot age was not associated with immediate verbal recall or recognition or with immediate visual recall. Almost all performance outliers occurred in pilots over 40 years old. Implications of a gradual decline in pilot cognition are discussed as well as the consideration of a subgroup of relatively poor cognitive performing pilots and the potential importance of assessing individual differences.

Objective: To compare the difference of mental health between aircrew and ground crew of army airmen and provide reference data for implementing corresponding norms. Design: Chester sampling investigation and paired design were applied. Setting: the 71687 Force of Chinese PLA, the 71521 Force of Chinese PLA, Department of Epidemiology, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA Participants: By chester sampling, 122 aircrew and 122 ground crew of one army airmen in one stationed training troop were randomized in February 2001. The pairs were made at ratio of 1:1 according to age difference less than 3 years and same sex and nationality. The investigated persons were all male, of Han and aged varied from 23 to 52 years. Methods: Cornell health questionnaire was adopted respectively in investigation of aircrew and ground crew of army airmen. The investigated persons finished and handed in questionnaire independently on the spot in manner of secretion and centralized filling-up. Cornell health questionnaire is composed of 18 sections, including 195 questions, involving 4 aspects, named somatic symptoms, medial and family history, general health and habit and mental symptoms. The total score of Cornell health questionnaire ≥ 30 indicates somatic and mental disturbance and the score of mental section ≥ 10 indicates mental disturbance, both of which are taken as the criteria in comparison of psychological health in receptors of two groups. Main outcome measures: Every factor score and total score in somatic and mental sections in Cornell health questionnaire for aircrew and ground crew. Results: The tested results of each 122 cases in either aircrew group or ground crew group entered result analysis. Evaluated results of somatic and mental symptoms in receptors of two groups: the total score was low in Cornell health questionnaire (0-14 scores), of which, the total score in aircrew group was higher than that in ground crew group (81.5% and 59.8%, P < 0.05); the score in mental section was low (0-9 scores), of which, that in aircrew group was higher remarkably than that in ground crew group (99.2% and 91.8%, P < 0.01); the score for the receptors with somatic and mental disturbance (total score ≥ 30, score in mental section ≥ 10) in aircrew group was lower than those in ground crew group (4.1% and 12.3%, P < 0.05); the score for the receptors with mental disturbance (score in mental section ≥ 10) in aircrew group was lower remarkably than ground crew group (0.8% and 8.2%, P < 0.01). For somatic section in aircrew group, except the factors of muscle, skeleton and skin, their scores were higher than those in ground crew group (P > 0.05), the scores of the rest factors were all lower than those in ground crew group, of which, the difference was significant in evaluation of factors of eye, ear, nervous system, urinary reproductive system and fatigue in comparison of two groups (P < 0.05). The score of every factor in mental section of aircrew group was lower than those in ground crew group. Except tension factor, in comparison of the rest factors in two groups, the significant difference was present (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Overall psychological health state in Cornell questionnaire of aircrew in army airmen was superior to ground crew. Aircrew still presents a part of psychological health questions, mainly in somatic section and inadaptability was the most positive response in mental section, suggesting that aircrew probably presents inadaptable phenomena.</abstract>', '<title>Prevalence and trigger factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders among male civil pilots in China</title> <abstract>Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common among the aircrew due to their arduous working environment. This study investigated the prevalence of FGIDs in Chinese male pilots and assessed the effects of trigger factors on the FGIDs. A cross-sectional study including 212 male pilots was performed in a Chinese large civil airline company. FGIDs were diagnosed according to the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The psychological performance, dietary pattern, sleep\xa0situation, and physical activity of the respondents were assessed. Logistic regression analysis and structural equation modeling were used to explore the association between these trigger factors and FGIDs. FGIDs were observed in 83 (39.22%) respondents, of which 31 (37.35%) had overlap syndromes. Age, flight level, flight time, high-salt food pattern, anxiety, and sleep performance were found to be associated with FGIDs (all P < 0.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the flight level (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31–0.080), high-salt food pattern (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.28–4.16), and sleep performance (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.11–5.14) were the influencing factors associated with FGIDs. Structural equation modeling confirmed the correlations between FGIDs and the occupational, dietary, and psychological factors with a reasonable fit.

The crews are responsible for working seamlessly together to provide 24/7 real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and precision-strike weapons capabilities for a wide range of global combat operations. Due to the rapid increase in global demands and operational tempo, there is growing concern from military leadership about the impact of operational stress on the health and psychological well-being of remote warriors. Previous assessments from 2011 and 2015 have demonstrated a significant increase in the reported rates of operators experiencing suicide ideation. The current study examined two protective factors expected to reduce the risk of suicide ideation–team member social support and leader social support. A total of 905 active duty remote warriors participated in occupational health assessments conducted in 2018. Risk factors for suicide ideation included being unmarried, worsening relationship problems, occupational burnout, and increased operational stress. Results indicated that team member and leader social support were significant protective factors for shift workers and those who reported being less likely to seek mental healthcare.

Perceptions and impacts of reconstitution among United States Air Force remotely piloted aircraft personnel</title> <abstract>United States Air Force remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) aircrew and support personnel perform critical missions in support of military operations around the world. The high value placed on the work of these individuals has resulted in increased workload and heightened risk of adverse psychological health outcomes. The impact of this can be detrimental to the health of the individual as well as the success of the RPA mission. To address these concerns, a combat-to-reconstitution policy was developed to provide additional downtime and recovery to RPA personnel, and recently piloted in some units within the RPA community. A total of 397 RPA personnel, of which 26% (n = 103) indicated their schedule was either internal or external reconstitution, completed an anonymous occupational health assessment sometime between November 2021 and July 2022. Responses included a mixture of both positive and negative experiences during the implementation of reconstitution, along with recommendations for improvements. Certain reconstitution-related sources of stress (e.g. work overload, lack of resources), were found to increase risk of burnout or psychological distress. Overall, this preliminary study provides a foundational landscape for the scientific and operational understanding of reconstitution as an operational intervention to improve recovery. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Factors such as exposure to visually traumatic events compounded by long working hours and blurred boundaries between military and civilian life have been cited as potential stressors. Robust research into the well-being of RPAS operators is scarce and mostly samples US personnel. Aims: To provide mental health and well-being data relating to UK RPAS operators. Methods: UK RPAS operators completed mental health questionnaires to assess levels of post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms, alcohol use and occupational functioning. Respondents were also asked about work patterns. Results: Forty-one per cent of the sample reported potentially hazardous alcohol use. Ten per cent met psychiatric symptom criteria for moderate or severe anxiety, and 20% for moderate depressive symptoms. While there were no cases of probable PTSD, 30% of the sample reported sub-clinical PTSD symptoms likely to impair occupational functioning. Overall, 70% of the sample reported that psychological symptoms significantly impaired their functioning. Conclusions: Compared to UK military sub-groups, RPAS operators were not at increased risk of mental health problems. However, a high proportion of the sample reported significant functional impairment, which has not been explored in other comparable studies. The most frequently highlighted work-related stressors were timing of RPAS work and operator shift patterns. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The objective was to assess factors that affect their job satisfaction and retention. The results will help guide development of Realistic Job Preview (RJP) videos for new recruits considering an RPA SO career. Background: Despite burgeoning demand and insufficient manning for RPAs to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities, research on the factors that contribute to operator job satisfaction and retention has been limited. Method: One hundred ten RPA SOs were surveyed to assess factors thought to affect person-job fit. Thematic content analysis by independent raters was done to provide insight into factors that (1) may make the RPA career field a good or poor fit, (2) unique challenges and rewards of the career field, (3) misconceptions about the career field, and (4) job characteristics influencing retention decisions. Results: A high level of agreement (mean Cohen’s kappa\xa0= 0.73) occurred across pairs of raters. The strongest content themes indicated having a direct effect on the battlefield was rewarding (65.1%), adjusting to shift work was challenging (64.7%), and the job entailed a high level of responsibility (56.3%).

The majority (45) of these were unsuitable for psychological reasons. Medical disability accounted for approximately 20% of the pilots separated from the company during the period of study. Age-specific disability rates increased rapidly after age 45 years, with cardiovascular disease responsible for more than 50% of these medical losses.

Any misadventure in either of their working worlds can lead to death. Yet the pathways to certification and implicit attitudes toward training are quite different in these 2 disciplines and provide an opportunity to compare and contrast the methodologies employed. At the 5th annual Innovations in the Surgical Environments Conference, senior and junior aviators and surgeons shared their experiences from the perspective of trainee and trainer and in the process presented an interesting study in parallels and contrasts. The US Navy follows a highly regimented training syllabus with graduated levels of responsibility designed to create the safest possible flying environment. Extensive preflight and postflight effort is required for each mission flown. Surgical training is also hierarchal in responsibility, but graduates demonstrate greater variability in their training experience. The surgical field can only fortify its emphasis on safety by seeking to provide the optimal training experiences necessary in the high-stakes environment of the operating theater.

In an effort to decrease pilot judgment-related accidents, the Federal Aviation Administration teaches new pilots about hazardous attitudes that are believed to be incompatible with safe flight: macho, impulsive, worry, resignation, self-confidence, and antiauthority. If these attitudes are hazardous for pilots and their passengers, they may also be incompatible with the reliable and safe delivery of surgical care. Questions/purposes: The purposes of this study were (1) to ascertain to what extent surgeons harbor hazardous attitudes; and (2) to determine their relationship, if any, to reoperation and readmission rates. Methods: We selected validated aviation psychology tools that are used to measure these attitudes in pilots. We converted the aviation scenarios to analogous situations for surgeons and invited all surgeons from one academic program to participate in this study. A total of 41 surgeons were eligible to participate; 37 (90%) completed the attitude prevalence protocol and 31 (76%) had complete reoperation and readmission data for the correlation and regression analysis. Attending orthopaedic surgeons completed the Modified Surgeon Hazardous Attitude Scale as well as a series of additional instruments. Results: Levels of macho thought to be hazardous in pilots were present in nine (24%) surgeons. Similar, elevated levels of self-confidence were found in three (8%) surgeons. High levels of impulsivity were found in 5% (two surgeons) and high levels of antiauthority were found in 3% (one surgeon). Only one (3%) surgeon reported elevated levels of worry and no surgeon reported hazardous levels of resignation. Thirty percent (11 surgeons) of surgeons harbored at least one elevated attitude level. In a regression model, macho attitude levels predicted 19% of the variation in surgeons’ rate of readmissions and reoperations. Conclusions: High levels of hazardous attitudes may not be consistent with the routine delivery of safe surgical care in a teamwork setting where human factors and safe systems are the key to success. Further research is needed to determine if abnormally high levels of these hazardous attitudes impact patient care. Level of Evidence: Level II, prognostic study.

There are reports of prominent physicians who practiced after becoming dangerous in old age, but the profession has not demonstrated the ability to prevent this. A mandatory retirement age could be discriminatory and take many competent physicians out of practice and risk a physician shortage. An increasing body of evidence regarding the relationship between physicians' age and performance has led organizations, such as the American College of Surgeons, to revisit this challenge. OBSERVATIONS: Since 1975, the number of practicing physicians older than 65 years in the United States has increased by more than 374%, and in 2015, 23% of practicing physicians were65 years orolder. Research shows that between ages40 and 75 years, the mean cognitive ability declines by more than 20%, but there is significant variability from one person to another, indicating that while some older physicians are profoundly impaired, others retain their ability and skills. There are age-based requirements for periodic testing and/or retirement for many professions including pilots, judges, air traffic controllers, Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, and firefighters. While there are not similar requirements for physicians, a few hospitals have introduced mandatory age-based evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: As physicians age, a required cognitive evaluation combined with a confidential, anonymous feedback evaluation by peers and coworkers regarding wellness and competence would be beneficial both to physicians and their patients. While it is unlikely that this will become a national standard soon, individual health care organizations could develop policies similar to those present at a few US institutions. In addition, large professional organizations should identify a range of acceptable policies to address the aging physician while leaving institutions flexibility to customize the approach. Absent robust professional initiatives in this area, regulators and legislators may impose more draconian measures. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.</abstract>""]"

Pilots’ age, total flight hours of B737-800, and exceedance data from 2016 to 2018 were collected. The results showed that exceedance rates increased rapidly among pilots aged 21–40, regardless of their flight exposure levels. In addition, flight exposure mediated the association between age and exceedance rates among pilots aged 21–35; age moderated the association between flight exposure and exceedance rates among pilots aged 26–35. Age directly affected exceedance rates among pilots aged 41–45 and 56–60.

During the 11-year follow-up period, a total of 12.9 million cumulative flight hours and 71 violations were recorded, yielding a rate of 5.5 violations per million pilot flight hours. Violation rate increased significantly with age from age 40 to the late 50s. Pilots who were 50 to 54 years old at baseline experienced almost twice the rate of violation involvement as pilots who were 45 to 49 years old at baseline. Total flight time at baseline, an indicator of flight experience, showed a significant protective effect against risk of violation. With adjustments for age, pilots who had 5,000 to 9,999 hr of total flight time at baseline were at significantly lower risk of violation than their less experienced counterparts (relative risk 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.85).

This investigation was a longitudinal study of U.S. Air Force security forces assigned to a year-long high-threat ground mission in Iraq to determine the degree to which airmen's emotional and behavioral health and committed relationships were adversely impacted by an extended deployment to a warzone. Participants were a cohort of 164 security forces airmen tasked to a 365-day deployment to train Iraqi police. Airmen completed study measures both prior to and 6-9 months following deployment. Rates of deterioration in individual and interpersonal adjustment were both significant and medium to large in magnitude of effect, d = 0.43 to 0.90. Results suggest that the negative effects of deployment are related to levels of traumatic experiences and do not spontaneously remit within the first 6-9 months following return from deployment-particularly among those service members having relatively lower levels of social support.

Results were analyzed to determine long-term consequences of the war imprisonment experience. We hypothesized that individuals experiencing the greatest stress and frustration might believe they gained more psychologically than those less stressed. The questionnaire results indicated a distinct subgroup of POWs for which this was particularly true, although the subjective sense of feeling somehow “benefited” by the experience was by no means universal. This study supports the hypothesis that the subjective sense of having benefited from the experience of war imprisonment is positively correlated with the harshness of the experience. © 1980, American Medical Association.

Employing an exploratory, concurrent, mixed-methods design with an electronic survey consisting of several valid instruments and single, face-to-face interviews; data were gathered from 119 surveys and 22 interviews. Four qualitative themes aligned with the Post-Deployment Readjustment Inventory items. Findings from interviews support and illuminate the outcomes of the Post-Deployment Readjustment Inventory. Behavioral health usage was high in the quantitative sample. Nearly 74% (n = 88) of respondents indicating they had used Military Behavioral Health services following deployment. Statistically significant differences were noted among all subscales except Intimate Relationship Problems. Combined results indicated en route care nurses encountered difficulties when attempting to return to predeployment roles; behavioral health problems mirrored those of combat warriors. Interventions to assist post-deployment reintegration of en route care nurses should be conducted at the peer, leader, and health care provider levels. Embedding military mental health providers into en route care units is needed.

Background: mindfulness-based training (MBT) have been used as a personal stress management tool in stressful working environments, including military aviation. There is little knowledge about the interpersonal mechanisms involved when engaging in MBT. Method: Adhering to Grounded Theory (GT), we conducted post-intervention interviews with 42 programme participants. We selected 30 interviews with evidence of interpersonal effects for in-depth analyses to build a theoretical model of the pathways through which interpersonal effects might develop. Results: The majority of the interviewees (30/42\xa0= 71%) experienced significant interpersonal effects from MBT. The in-depth analyses revealed an increase in the common theme “Sense of Fellowship” (SOF). SOF comprised three primary change processes: “Attention to others,” “Self-observation” and “Reflection.” In addition, five behavioral changes emerged: “Direct communication,” “Increased patience,” “Decreased anger expression,” “Calmness,” and “Acceptance.” Finally, four contextual factors appeared to have particular importance for the development of SOF: “Plenary sessions,” “Sharing experiences,” “Doing something new together,” and “Sitting in silence.” Conclusion: These findings indicate that MBT has prosocial effects in a military aviation setting, and the constructed model contributes theoretically by suggesting how these psychosocial effects may arise and develop. © 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: 98 flight attendants from Xiamen Airlines in China were recruited and randomly assigned to the LKM training group (n = 49) or the waiting control group (n = 49). The LKM training group underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention, and the control group did not undergo intervention. The three main variables (SWB, mindfulness, and spirituality) were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. Results: In the experimental group, SWB and spirituality increased significantly. In the control group, no significant differences were observed for the three variables between the pre-test and post-test. Conclusions: Our results indicated that LKM may help to improve SWB and spirituality. However, the mechanisms which underlie the effects of the LKM on mindfulness, spirituality, SWB, and other psychological constructs require further elucidation. © 2020 by the authors.

Background: Periods of persistent, intensive work demands are known to compromise recovery and attentional capacity. The effects of 4-month MT on salivary cortisol and performance on 2 computer-based cognitive tasks were tested on a military helicopter unit exposed to a prolonged period of high workload. Methods: MT participants were compared to a wait list control group on levels of saliva cortisol and performance on a go–no go test and a test of stimulus-driven attentional capture. Participants also reported mental demands on the go–no go test, time of wakeup, sleep duration, quality of sleep, outcome expectancies, physical activity level, self-perceived mindfulness, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The results from a mixed between–within analysis revealed that the MT participants compared to the control group had a larger pre to post increase in high- and low-cortisol slopes, and decrease in perceived mental demand imposed by the go–no go test.

However, studies in space or in space-analog environments struggle to find a consensus on the affective impact of these stressors. Also, there is a lack of research using multiple measures to assess affective states in these conditions (e.g., positive and negative measures and physiological parameters). More research is needed to understand the psycho-physiological mechanisms during long-duration space-like missions. Our study was conducted during a space-analog confinement (SIRIUS-19). Throughout the mission, we assessed variations of affective states using subjective and physiological parameters. We expected interindividual variability, with transitory and chronic changes on the psychological and physiological dimensions of affective states. METHODS: Six subjects (three men/three women; four Russians/two Americans; age = 33.83 ± 6.37) performed the protocol once a month during the 4-mo confinement. Subjects completed various psychometric scales about their affective states (Self-Assessment Manikin, Positive and Negative Affective Schedule) and provided hair cortisol samples. Due to the small sample size, only individual values and descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Psychometric measures remained positive and stable. Hair cortisol levels increased at the beginning of the mission (from 31.79 ± 18.05 pg · mg−1 to 62.25 ± 31.99 pg · mg−1). Most of the measurements showed interindividual variability. DISCUSSION: T he subjective affective states remained positive and relatively stable throughout the mission. The initial increase of hair cortisol is attributed to an adaptation phase of the crew. No affective variation seems to be related to this phase. Our results indicate effective affective adaptation to the confinement. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>Facial Expression Perception and Psychological Changes During Space Analogs</title> <abstract>Facial expression perception is the process by which someone can interpret the emotion of another individual using their facial cues. Below-average scores on tests designed to measure facial expression recognition (FER) accuracies are associated with inappropriate behavioral responses and are often linked to mental or neurological disorders. Head-down bed rest microgravity analog studies show changes in facial emotion processing that may indicate a behavioral health risk during spaceflight. METHODS: During short-duration space analog missions at two separate facilities, 15 subjects took daily FER tests before, during, and after the mission. Each test was accompanied by questionnaires measuring either potential causal or impacted variables: stress, depression, loneliness, irritability, risk-taking, empathy, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS: Analysis of variance and post hoc t-tests showed that during the mission, the subjects were less likely to identify angry, sad, or fearful faces as disgusted compared to the baseline. Also, interest/enjoyment and perceived competence increased throughout the mission lifecycle. Multiple regression analyses were able to account for greater than 20% of the variance for depression and health/safety risk-taking using the FER data. DISCUSSION: Changes in FER during space mission simulations show that perception changes are not limited to microgravity analogs. A perceptual change was observed during the short-duration missions, but there is not sufficient evidence to show behavioral health impacts. However, associations between FER and the questionnaires show a potential to develop predictive models, countermeasures, or psychological monitoring tools using FER. Additional research is required to determine the efficacy of such tools during long-duration spaceflight. © (2024), (Aerospace Medical Association).

These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6\xa0g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2\xa0days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment. © © 2024 Ouchi, Kono, Satou, Kurashima, Yamaguchi, Kimura and Shibukawa.</abstract>', ""<title>Changes in stress hormones and metabolism during a 105-day simulated Mars mission</title> <abstract>Background: The Mars-105 project was aimed at simulating crew ' s activities, workload, and communication during a mission to Mars, evaluating the homeostatic adaptations to prolonged confinement and cohabitation. Methods: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin, C-peptide, leptin, cortisol, and NGF and BDNF plasma levels were monitored in six healthy nonsmoking male subjects taking part in a 105-d Mars mission simulation. Samples were collected from each subject before (0 wk), during (2.5 wk; 5 wk; 10 wk; 15 wk), and after confinement (+1 wk). Results: Confinement resulted in impaired glucometabolic parameters, since FPG increased during the first 5 wk (baseline: 85.2 ± 10.8 mg · dl-1; 2.5 wk: 98.4 ± 4.7 mg · dl-1; 5 wk: 92.5 ± 6.0 mg · dl-1) and insulin dropped at 2.5 wk (baseline: 14.4 ± 4.8 mU · L-1; 2.5 wk: 7.7 ± 2.1 mU · L-1), subsequently returning to baseline values. HOMA-IR paralleled plasma insulin, dropping to 1.8 ± 0.5 at 2.5 wk (baseline: 3.0 ± 1.2).

It is known from the works of Ch. Osgood that the semantic differential scale is a reliable way to obtain objective information on the emotional attitudes towards a topic of interest. Within the frame of the Russian space experiment “Interactions” on the International Space Station (ISS), a computerized survey, the Personal Self-Perception and Attitudes (PSPA), was developed for analyzing the subjects’ emotional attitudes toward their social environment. In the course of the PSPA procedure, the crewmembers rate each other and themselves (in the past, present, and future) using the criteria previously personally chosen. These criteria should be regarded as their personal values. A total of 30 subjects have already completed the study on board the ISS. The main tasks of the study are: (1) to define individual and group values and the extent of group identification reflected in sharing these values; (2) to determine the impact of cross-cultural factors on mutual perceptions and self-perceptions in space crews and with the Mission Control Center (MCC); (3) to study changes in the space crews’ group cohesiveness and structure as they are exposed to the stress of the extended space mission environment. The data obtained indicate an increase in a “psychological distance” between the crew and the MCC personnel versus increased crew cohesion. The results gained made it possible to identify the most significant categories of values common to the subjects from the professional cosmonaut group. The priority of these shared values for each subject is an important condition for the formation of a cohesive crew. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>', '<title>Crewmember and ground personnel interactions over time during Shuttle/Mir space missions</title> <abstract>Background: Anecdotal reports from space and results from simulation studies on Earth have suggested that space crewmembers may experience decrements in their mood and interpersonal environment during the 2nd hall of the mission and that negative emotions may be displaced to outside monitoring personnel. Methods: To evaluate these issues, we studied 5 American astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 American and 16 Russian mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir space program. Subjects completed questions from the Profile of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale (GES), and the Work Environment Scale (WES) on a weekly basis during the missions. Subscale scores from these measures were analyzed using a piecewise linear regression approach that analyzed normally distributed subscales using a mixed model and non-normally distributed subscales by dichotomizing the variables and using a generalized estimating equation. Results: After protecting against possible Type I errors due to multiple significance tests, only weak support was found for the biphasic model: the only significant findings in favor of the hypothesized 2nd hall decrements in the interpersonal environment were in crewmember GES Leader Support and astronaut WES Work Pressure. Strongly consistent confirmation was found on all six tested measures for the hypothesized displacement of tension and dysphoria from crewmembers to mission control personnel. The hypothesized displacement of tension and dysphoria from mission control personnel to management was found on five of the six tested measures. Conclusions: The absence of moderate to strong support for the biphasic model suggests that crewmember interpersonal functioning does not depend appreciably on 1st half/2nd hall time effects. The consistent support found for the displacement of tension and dysphoria suggests that countermeasures need to be developed to deal with this phenomenon in both crewmembers and mission control personnel.</abstract>', '<title>Crewmember and mission control personnel interactions during international space station missions</title> <abstract>Introduction: Reports from astronauts and cosmonauts, studies from space analogue environments on Earth, and our previous research on the Mir Space Station have identified a number of psychosocial issues that can lead to problems during long-duration space missions. Three of these issues (time effects, displacement, leader role) were studied during a series of long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Methods: As in our previous Mir study, mood and group climate questions from the Profile of Mood States or POMS, the Group Environment Scale or GES, and the Work Environment Scale or WES were completed weekly by 17 ISS crewmembers (15 men, 2 women) in space and 128 American and Russian personnel in mission control.

These problems stem from crewmember tension and its displacement to the outside monitoring personnel, and from disruptions in crew cohesion and unclear leadership roles. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that crew tension and dysphoria would transiently increase following stressful events and be greater in the second half of a mission; that cohesion would be less during the second half of a mission; that tension and dysphoria would be displaced to the outside monitoring personnel; and that high levels of leader support and control would produce high levels of cohesion. Methods: We tested these hypotheses during a 135-d Mir space station simulation study in Moscow. At weekly intervals, the three crewmembers completed items from two group climate questionnaires, a mood questionnaire, and a log of stressful events. Results: Contrary to expectations, there was significantly (p < 0.05) more total mood disturbance and tension during the first 9 wks than during the subsequent 10 wks of the simulation. Although levels of cohesion remained the same over lime, cohesion scores dropped at a significantly greater rate during the last third of the seclusion. There was evidence for the displacement of tension and dysphoria to the outside monitoring personnel. There were significant correlations in the predicted direction between leader support and control and crew cohesion, as well as evidence of status leveling in the mission commander. Conclusions: Crewmember tension, cohesion, and leadership are important issues affecting people working in secluded environments, and they need to be studied further in space.</abstract>']"

Background: The barrage of data in the GCS visual interface has the potential to isolate the operator from detecting system hazards that threatens the ability of the operator to operate the UAS effectively. Method: The pitch of the UAS’s engine revolutions per minute was mapped to a sonification, and excessive attitude upset of the UAS was mapped to a tactification in order to present a continuous awareness of the system’s health without being invasive and obtrusive. Participants with and without flying experience were required to monitor system health, while carrying out a secondary task. Results: Regardless of flying experience, sonification enhanced hazard detection compared to a visual-only GCS interface, but tactification did not aid performance. Conclusion: While multimodal displays have been studied in remotely piloted vehicles, this is the initial effort to demonstrate that sonification can influence perceived urgency leading to greater warning compliance. Further research is warranted to develop guidelines to ensure that non-visual signals can convey different levels of urgency for a continuous awareness of a system’s health, and thereby permit the operator to establish the appropriate level of priority to address the alarmed condition. © 2019, © 2019 Crown Copyright.</abstract>', '<title>Cognitive Response Efficiency Under Varying Audiovisual Display Modalities of Flight Deck Warnings</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Warning information is mainly transmitted to pilots through visual and auditory forms in flight, with only a small portion transmitted through vibration.

Flight simulator tests were carried out with four types of warnings triggered randomly for comparison with simulation results and thereby performed model validation. Statistical tests were performed to examine the significant differences and effect sizes. RESULTS: Both cognitive models (response time 0.82 ± 0.06 s with voice vs. 1.37 ± 0.09 s without voice in static forms; 1.35 ± 0.56 s with voice vs. 1.83 ± 0.32 s without voice in flashing forms) and subjects’ response time (1.42 ± 0.37 s with voice vs. 1.53 ± 0.42 s without voice in static forms; 1.43 ± 0.44 s with voice vs. 1.65 ± 0.43 s without voice in flashing forms) suggest the benefits of using voice prompts to improve performance, while flashing forms of warnings may impose an extra burden on cognition even though they bring the benefit of attracting attention. DISCUSSION: By carrying out a joint analysis with cognitive modeling and flight simulator tests, this work shows that designers can make use of alternative sensory channels for achieving a timely transfer of attention, but with a risk of increasing cognitive load. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', '<title>A psychophysiological evaluation of the perceived urgency of auditory warning signals</title> <abstract>One significant concern that pilots have about cockpit auditory warnings is that the signals presently used lack a sense of priority. The relationship between auditory warning sound parameters and perceived urgency is, therefore, an important topic of enquiry in aviation psychology. The present investigation examined the relationship among subjective assessments of urgency, reaction time, and brainwave activity with three auditory warning signals. Subjects performed a tracking task involving automated and manual conditions, and were presented with auditory warnings having various levels of perceived and situational urgency. Subjective assessments revealed that subjects were able to rank warnings on an urgency scale, but rankings were altered after warnings were mapped to a situational urgency scale. Reaction times differed between automated and manual tracking task conditions, and physiological data showed attentional differences in response to perceived and situational warning urgency levels. This study shows that the use of physiological measures sensitive to attention and arousal, in conjunction with behavioural and subjective measures, may lead to the design of auditory warnings that produce a sense of urgency in an operator that matches the urgency of the situation. © 1995 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Synthesized warning messages: effects of an alerting cue in single- and multiple-function voice synthesis systems</title> <abstract>The present study examined the effectiveness of preceding synthesized voice warning messages with an alerting cue as a function of the amount of information presented by the voice synthesizer and the workload level in the primary task.

Dynamic allocation is a way, for example, to avoid human workload peaks. Depending on whether tasks or functions are allocated, the demands made on human-machine co-operation design are different. Task and subtask allocation assume that both the human operator and the machine (or its designer) share the same decomposition of the overall task into subtasks. Function delegation is less demanding, provided that the human operator delegates functions to the machine explicitly, and within the context of a task representation transmitted by the human. This paper discusses these principles on the basis of experimental results taken from a series of studies on human-machine cooperation in air traffic control.</abstract>', '<title>On-the-fly scheduling as a manifestation of partial-order planning and dynamic task values</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a computational account of the spontaneous task ordering that occurs within jobs as work unfolds (""on-the-fly task scheduling""). Background: Air traffic control is an example of work in which operators have to schedule their tasks as a partially predictable work flow emerges. To date, little attention has been paid to such on-the-fly scheduling situations. Method: We present a series of discrete-event models fit to conflict resolution decision data collected from experienced controllers operating in a highfidelity simulation. Results: Our simulations reveal air traffic controllers\' scheduling decisions as examples of the partialorder planning approach of Hayes-Roth and Hayes- Roth. The most successful model uses opportunistic first-come-first-served scheduling to select tasks from a queue. Tasks with short deadlines are executed immediately. Tasks with long deadlines are evaluated to assess whether they need to be executed immediately or deferred. Conclusion: On-the-fly task scheduling is computationally tractable despite its surface complexity and understandable as an example of both the partial-order planning strategy and the dynamic-value approach to prioritization.

Background: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance. Method: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to ""adaptable"") automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a ""level of automation"" as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook® is described. Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team\'s ""playbook."" Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles. Conclusion: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level. Application: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate.

Understanding adaptive allocation and its effects on operator performance and workload is limited by sparse systematic research and an underdeveloped theoretical framework for implementation. The purpose of this research was to determine the efficacy of adaptive allocation by implementing adaptive allocation in a multiple task aviation simulation based on a taxonomy with facets of invocation philosophy and allocation strategy. Pilot performance was evaluated to determine benefits and costs for the implementation of adaptive allocation in a multitask aviation simulation with tracking, system monitoring, and target identification tasks. The results provide support for the implementation of adaptive allocation based on a hybrid model comprising elements of operator performance and mission relevant variables. Implementation of adaptive allocation was an effective countermeasure to the predictable decrease in tracking performance associated with the initial presentation of a surface target. Benefits were also identified for monitoring task performance despite the fact that the monitoring task was not modified by the implementation of automation. Secondary benefits included improved time estimates. Potential costs of adaptive allocation included performance variability in the tracking when task partitioning was the adaptive strategy. Implications of results for design, philosophy, and theory are presented.</abstract>', '<title>Functional Allocation of Roles Between Humans and Automation for a Pairing Tool Used for Simultaneous Approaches</title> <abstract>Aircraft operations on parallel runways continue to motivate research into tools that can improve capacity safely by defining and automating procedures. However, there is no formal process or automation tool today to assist the air traffic controller with pairing aircraft for simultaneous approaches. To address this need, a controller-based aircraft pairing tool to assist controllers in pairing and aligning aircraft for simultaneous arrivals to parallel runways 750 ft apart was developed. Two simulation studies conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center evaluated different stages of evolution of this tool.

We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Are crews empowered with all the resources needed to successfully address an inflight emergency? Checklists, a necessary but insufficient tool</title> <abstract>Although safety in aviation has increased exponentially in recent decades, sadly, plane crashes will always be associated with the operation of the aviation world. The efforts should be directed towards the pursuit of “zero accidents”, providing aircrews with the necessary resources to minimize risks. One of the most important flight operation resources used in aviation is the checklist. However, when faced with an emergency, the crew cannot always make use of them, either because the huge diversity of potential emergencies does not allow to collect all of them in these manuals, or because the time available to react is so short that it makes it impossible to utilize them. This paper shows how aircraft checklists are a necessary but insufficient tool to solve complex, unpredictable, and novel emergencies. Furthermore, based on successfully solved critical events, the authors suggest the implementation of specific techniques for the learning and development of problem-solving programs focused on innovation and divergent thinking to decision making, as part of flight training, in order to increase the crews’ capability to face such emergencies. © 2018 The Author(s).</abstract>', ""<title>An Alternative Method for Identifying a Failed Engine in Twin-Engine Propeller Aircraft</title> <abstract>Twin-engine propeller aircraft accidents occur due to mechanical reasons as well as human error, such as misidentifying a failed engine.

Background: Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Black Hole Illusion (BHI), with differing predictions. The Constant Visual Angle hypothesis predicts that short runways should cause greater BHI. Meanwhile, several other hypotheses predict that longer runways should cause more severe BHI. In addition, there is debate whether lack of ground cues promotes BHI via autokinesis or by biasing pilots’ perception of the runway. Method: Nineteen qualified pilots flew 27 simulated nighttime approaches in a fixed-base flight simulator. Participants flew under different combinations of runway length, starting distance from the runway, and starting altitude. We analyzed glideslope error, defined as a weighted sum of the error above or below a prescribed 3° glideslope, as well as RMSE around the approach path. Results: We found that pilots tended to demonstrate worse BHI effects during approaches to longer runways and when starting at low altitudes compared to high altitudes. Daylight and nighttime flights showed a similar variance around the glideslope. Conclusion: The constant visual angle hypothesis is not supported by our findings. We observed consistent glideslopes across starting locations and similar variance during day/night conditions, leading us to favor biased perception of the runway over autokinetic effects to explain the influence of contextual features on BHI. ©, The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Navy, Department of Defense, nor the U.S. Government.

Background: BHI occurs when impoverished visual conditions at night cause pilots to fly too low on landing approaches. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain BHI, without clear consensus in the literature. Method: We conducted multiple experiments in which participants judged the intersection point of dotted lines on a computer screen. In Experiment 1, participants placed a horizon line where they believed two converging dotted line segments should intersect. In Experiments 2A and 2B, participants estimated the intersection point of single dotted line segments with a separate solid line. Results: Participants in Experiment 1 tended to place the intersection point of two converging lines too low on the computer screen. Participants in Experiments 2A and 2B tended to respond as if the stimulus lines were more horizontal than actually presented. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pilots misjudge the location of an implicit horizon based on the runway edge lines. In the context of a visual spatial strategy that assumes a stable horizon, such a misperception may cause pilots to adopt a low flight path. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Investigating a Computational Explanation of the Black Hole Illusion</title> <abstract>Objective: We investigated the role of Perrone’s algorithm in the Black Hole Illusion (BHI). After analyzing the algorithm and identifying two of its predictions, we empirically tested them with two on-line experiments. Background: In 1983, Perrone proved that in daylight conditions it is possible to compute the descent angle using a ratio of retinal distances corresponding to the runway and surrounding context. Using the algorithm in nighttime conditions, with just the visible runway, pilots would overestimate the descent angle, leading to the BHI. Method: Mathematical analysis indicates the algorithm predicts a large BHI; perhaps too large if there are no mitigating factors. As Perrone noted, the BHI illusion magnitude should be affected by runway width; we also found that some conditions predict a reverse BHI (pilots should underestimate their descent angle). In our experiments, participants observed a cockpit view of a runway during five seconds of steady approach. In a subsequent still image, participants indicated where they believed the plane would land if it continued its flight path. We measured the accuracy of the landing positions for various runway widths and various background contexts. Results: The experiments did not show a BHI for any conditions; so the experiments do not validate the model predictions. Conclusion: Based on our analyses, Perrone’s algorithm does not provide an adequate explanation of the Black Hole Illusion. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', ""<title>Quantitative analyses and empirical tests of perceptual theories of the Black Hole Illusion</title> <abstract>The Black Hole Illusion (BHI) is a nighttime aviation landing illusion where pilots overestimate their descent angle. This dangerous illusion can cause pilots to compensate by flying lower than intended, which can result in them crashing into the ground or obstacles in front of the runway. A common interpretation of the BHI is that it is a perceptual illusion, and two quantitative perception based theories have been proposed. The first theory was developed by Perrone (1983), and it assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to the loss of contextual information surrounding the runway, such as ground texture, during nighttime landing conditions. Adapted from work by Galanis et al. (1998) and Robinson et al. (2020), the second (eye-level) theory assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to loss of the horizon during nighttime landing conditions. Quantitative analyses of Perrone's theory suggest that the magnitude of the illusion should vary with runway width and length in nighttime conditions, but in daylight conditions there should be no illusion and no effect of runway width or length. Analyses of the eye-level theory predict no impact of runway width or length for any condition. Across two empirical laboratory studies, we do demonstrate a BHI for nighttime evaluations of descent angle, but the data do not support either theory. Thus, the two algorithms analyzed here are not sufficient to explain the BHI; and the BHI may reflect general disorientation due to limited information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>""]"

Although significant differences were found between groups for Fleet Replacement Squadron flight grades and Training Command composite grades, no significant differences were found between the groups for Training Command carrier qualification grades or Fleet Replacement Squadron carrier qualification. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that SERGRADS have more problems or are poorer aviators than F/A-18 students from other sources.</abstract>']"

Background: Subjective workload measures such as the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) and NASA Task Load Index are sensitive to single-task parameters and dual-task loads but have not attempted to measure workload in particular mental processes. An alternative is the MRQ. Method: In Experiment 1, participants completed simple laboratory tasks and the MRQ after each. Interference between tasks was then correlated to three different task similarity metrics: profile similarity, based on r2 between ratings; overlap similarity, based on summed minima; and overall demand, based on summed ratings. Experiment 2 used similar methods but more complex computer-based games. Results: In Experiment 1 the MRQ moderately predicted interference (r = +.37), with no significant difference between metrics. In Experiment 2 the metric effect was significant, with overlap similarity excelling in predicting interference (r = +.83). Mean ratings showed high diagnosticity in identifying specific mental processing bottlenecks. Conclusion: The MRQ shows considerable promise as a cognitive-process-sensitive workload measure. Application: Potential applications of the MRQ include the identification of dual-processing bottlenecks as well as process overloads in single tasks, preparatory to redesign in areas such as air traffic management, advanced flight displays, and medical imaging.

Over the course of the flight, pilots flew along specified routes while scheduling and performing several flight-related secondary tasks. The first phase of flight was flown under low-workload conditions, whereas the second phase of flight was flown under high-workload conditions in the form of increased turbulence and a disorganized instrument layout. Six pilots were randomly assigned to each of three workload preview groups. Subjects in the no-preview group were not given preview of the increased-workload conditions. Subjects in the declarative preview group were verbally informed of the nature of the flight workload manipulation but did not receive any practice under the high-workload conditions. Subjects in the procedural preview group received the same instructions as the declarative preview group but also flew half of the practice flight under the high-workload conditions. The results show that workload preview fostered efficient scheduling strategies. Specifically, those pilots with either declarative or procedural preview of future workload demands adopted an efficient strategy of scheduling more of the difficult secondary tasks during the low-workload phase of flight. However, those pilots given a procedural preview showed the greatest benefits in overall flight performance. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Predictive models of workload are valuable at the early stages of system design to identify potentially excessive demands on the human operator before major system development commences. This paper describes the early development of a task-based predictive workload method. It utilizes a scenario-based timeline analysis supplemented by characterizations of the cognitive nature of the pilot's tasks using Wickens' multiple resource theory, followed by the identification of likely task conflicts and estimates of the influence of the task environment. Workload predictions were made for a manual approach, landing and roll-out scenario in a modern airliner. Predictions were compared against corresponding Bedford scale workload estimates. Results show that the predictive workload technique produced comparable estimates of cognitive workload measured using the Bedford scale. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"", '<title>Role of Multiple Resources in Predicting Time-Sharing Efficiency: Evaluation of Three Workload Models in a Multiple-Task Setting</title> <abstract>The goal of our study was to assess the validity of the assumptions underlying three prominent workload models: the Time-Line Analysis and Prediction workload model (Parks & Boucek, 1989), the VACP workload model (Aldrich, Szabo, & Bierbaum, 1989), and the W/INDEX model (North & Riley, 1989). Sixteen subjects flew a low-fidelity flight simulation. Subjects were required to perform a two-axis tracking task, a concurrent visual-monitoring task, and a discrete decision task. The decision task had 16 variations defined by two levels on each of the following dimensions: input modality (visual vs. auditory), processing code (spatial vs. verbal), difficulty (easy vs. hard), and response modality (manual vs. voice). Dual-task costs were found only for the tracking task. The tracking data were then analyzed using two approaches: a traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a correlational analysis of tracking performance versus model predictions. The ANOVA revealed that performance on the tracking task was better when the concurrent decision task was responded to vocally and was easy. Input modality and processing code of the concurrent decision task had no significant effect on tracking performance. The correlational analysis was used to evaluate each of the three models, to determine what features were responsible for improving the models’ fit, and to compare their performance with a pure time-line model that makes no multiple-resource assumptions. All three models did a good job of predicting variance between experimental conditions, accounting for between 56% and 84% of the variance in our data and between 10% and 40% of an earlier data set. Different features of each model that affect the fit are then discussed. We conclude that it is important for models to retain a multiple-resource coding, although the best features of that coding remain to be determined. Coding tasks by their demand level appears to be less critical. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>']"

In order to treat fear of flying most efficiently, it is important to find out which aspects are related to flight anxiety. The objective of the present study was to examine the extent to which various cognitive coping strategies in response to a flight were used by airline passengers and their relationship with anxiety symptoms. Method: A total of 261 persons who were all seeking treatment for fear of flying filled in the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the anxiety subscales of the Symptom Check List (SCL-90), the Flight Anxiety Situations questionnaire, and the Flight Anxiety Modality questionnaire. Results: Respondents reported using refocus on planning, rumination, putting into perspective to the highest extent, and catastrophizing and other-blame to the lowest extent. Furthermore, respondents who reported using self-blame, acceptance, rumination, and/or catastrophizing to a higher extent, also reported significantly higher levels of anxiety. Discussion: As the present study suggests that several cognitive coping strategies are related to anxiety, intervention programs should pay attention to these aspects. The present study gives important clues about which cognitive coping strategies should be challenged in treatment of flight anxiety.</abstract>', '<title>Phobic fear of flying in aircrews: Epidemiological aspects and comorbidity</title> <abstract>Background: Phobic fear of flying may affect aircrew members during any phase of their flying careers. Symptoms are beyond voluntary control and may lead patients to avoid flying and seek medical advice. Methods: Of 1101 psychiatric files from our institute for 1985-2002, 1 50 represented cases of fliers who suffered from phobic fear of flying. Data collected from those files included assessment of fear-evoking situations, type of aircraft, class of aircrew duties, aircraft accident history, past medical history, age, and associated psychiatric comorbidity. Results: We compared a group of 56 pilots with 94 other aircrew members. Results included 143 cases of flight phobia behavior and 7 cases of anxiety about parachuting. Flight phobia was less frequent among pilots (37.4%) than the other aircrew members (62.6%). We found a history of aircraft accident to the patient or an acquaintance in 25% of the cases. Observed comorbid psychiatric disorders (54%) consisted of depressive disorders (22%), anxiety disorders (16%), and personality disorders (7.4%). Fixed-wing pilots and aircrews members had a higher incidence of depression than did rotary-wing pilots and crew-members (p < 0.05). Rotary-wing pilots and crewmembers had a higher rate of anxiety disorders (p < 0.05). Discussion: Flight phobia encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical origins that may lead pilots or other aircrew members to refuse to fly. We recommend a careful psychiatric evaluation and close follow-up to adequately diagnose fliers with flight phobic reactions, as well as establishing adequate medical and/or psychological treatment.

In spite of a random relationship between all slide categories and outcome (illusory correlation), flight phobics exhibited a covariation bias and showed higher CEs for the contingency between FR slides and shocks than for the contingency between FI slides and shocks in a first experimental block. The CEs of flight phobics for FR slides and shocks was significantly higher than that of non-flight-phobic individuals, while high- and low-fear participants did not differ in their CEs for the other slide- shock combinations.

Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background: The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method: A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results: Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board. Conclusion: PAV manufacturers, operators, and policymakers can utilize these findings to incorporate crucial design elements needed for PAVs to satisfy user expectations. These findings identify priorities that should be targeted in relative timeframes to satisfy near-term and long-term PAV users appropriately. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>User acceptance of autonomous combined transport systems in Germany: a cross-conceptual view</title> <abstract>The concept of autonomous combined transport utilizes autonomous vehicles for simultaneous passenger and goods transportation and is associated with a reduction in road traffic through bundling effects and economies of scale. Yet, its potential benefits particularly hinge on penetration and utilization rates. To date, few studies have explored user acceptance of systems that integrate passenger and freight flows. In this context, a research gap that is particularly evident pertains to the user acceptance of different concepts within autonomous combined transport. Extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), this paper examines the effects of six psychological constructs on the behavioral intention to use an autonomous combined transport system. Surveying 1040 respondents from Germany, two distinct combined transport concepts—scheduled and on-demand—were examined to identify key acceptance factors and operational peculiarities. Results from structural equation modelling show that the acceptance of autonomous combined transport systems depends on both, the operational concept as well as the purpose of use, with socio-demographic characteristics featuring different indirect effects per concept. Moreover, we find that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, price value, personal attitude, and trust are significant predictors of behavioral intention across both concepts, while the average order frequency of a potential user has a negative indirect impact on behavioral intention. Results show that an extended UTAUT2 model can conceptualize factors influencing autonomous combined transport acceptance, emphasizing the importance of investigating a user’s behavioral intention based on the specific operational concept. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>', '<title>Cars are Ready to Fly: Urban Air Mobility and Psychological Process of Sustainable Travel Mode Choices</title> <abstract>Objective: This study is designed to predict individuals’ pro-social behavior in their choice of travel modes.

Background: Urban air mobility, the next generation urban transport system, is all set to fly. Urban air mobility is a notable disruptive innovation in aviation and mobility system as a sustainable means of transportation. Method: Using a quantitative procedure, we developed the theoretical framework based on the existing theories and examined hypotheses using structural equation modeling and invariance test. Results: The findings indicate that the adoption intention toward urban air mobility is driven by problem recognition, awareness, interest, evaluation, ascribed responsibility, and personal norms. In addition, the relative advantage of urban air mobility moderates the relationships between interest and evaluation, and between ascribed responsibility and personal norms.

A problem with decelerating approaches, however, is that they typically lead to increased spacing, which in turn results in a significant reduction of runway landing capacity. A possible solution to this problem might be to delegate the task of separating the aircraft during the approach to the pilot. To aid the pilot, an algorithm has been developed that predicts the trajectory of the preceding aircraft and optimizes the flap schedule based on this prediction. Offline simulations indicate that using this system runway throughput numbers of up to 98% of the capacity of a conventional instrument landing system (ILS) approach can be achieved (Ren & Clarke, 2003). To assess practical implementation issues and to investigate pilot appreciation, a piloted experiment was conducted, for which a pilot support interface has been developed that presents the future separation information in an intuitive fashion. The experiment showed that it is indeed possible for pilots to perform the spacing task while flying a TDDA. The pilot support interface significantly reduces pilot workload when compared to a baseline display. Also the effects of off-nominal lead pilot behavior on pilot performance are reduced by the use of online flap schedule optimization and separation prediction. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Automatic dependent surveillance - Broadcast/cockpit display of traffic information: Innovations in pilot-managed departures</title> <abstract>An operational evaluation of the automatic dependent surveillance system and cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) was performed in October 2000.

Departure profiles were established to evaluate the ability of flight crews and air traffic controllers to manage long (6 nautical miles [nm]) and short (4.5 nm) spacing intervals between departing aircraft. Approximately 4% of the departures conducted when CDTI was not used and 9% when it was involved communication problems. Fortunately, controllers and pilots detected and corrected these problems in midstream. When pilots executed CDTI departures, there was an overall increase in time on frequency, more time spent under local control during the day, and departures were completed in less time when assigned the short spacing interval.</abstract>', '<title>Design Factors of Guiding Aircraft Through Continuous Descent Operations: Pilot and Controller Perspectives</title> <abstract>Objective: This survey identifies the design factors needed to guide aircraft through continuous descent operation (CDO) procedures.

Method: One hundred and twenty surveys were distributed and 61 pilots and 49 controllers responded. Eight pilots and 25 controllers had experience implementing CDOs. Results: All respondents ranked altitude control as the most important design factor. Pilots with CDO experience preferred to reduce the frequency of communication in the procedure, whereas experienced controllers expected to know the approach path as early as possible.

The common goal for both studies was to achieve visual meteorological capacity under instrument meteorological conditions, when landing aircraft on parallel runways 750 ft apart. Using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, both studies investigated procedures related to breakout maneuvers on final approach during off-nominal conditions. The first study investigated procedures for 2 parallel runways (involving a leading and trailing aircraft) and the second study examined 3 parallel runways separated by 750 ft, investigating procedures for 3 simultaneously arriving aircraft (leading, center, and right aircraft). In both studies, off-nominal events were introduced during the approach. In some cases the wake of the leading aircraft drifted too close to the aircraft behind. In others, the leading aircraft deviated off its course and blundered toward the trailing aircraft. Statistical analysis examined the effects of approach echelon (2-runway vs. 3-runway), breakout cause, and breakout location on the dependent measures of breakout trajectory cross-track error, breakout trajectory track angle error, pilot workload, and pilot situation awareness. Although revealing differences between the study conditions, results also show accurate cross-track and track angle error levels (i.e., high levels of breakout trajectory accuracy), manageable pilot workload, and high levels of pilot situation awareness across all conditions in both studies.

Background: Nontechnical skills of pilots are crucial for the conduct of safe flight operations. To train and assess these skills, reliable expert ratings are required. Literature shows to some degree that interrater reliability is influenced by factors related to the targets, scenarios, rating tools, or the raters themselves. Method: Thirty-seven type-rating examiners from a European airline assessed the performance of 4 flight crews based on video recordings using LOSA and adapted NOTECHS tools. We calculated r<inf>wg</inf> and ICC(3) to measure within-group agreement and interrater reliability. Results: The findings indicated that within-group agreement and interrater reliability were not always acceptable. It was shown that the performance of outstanding pilots was rated with the highest within-group agreement. For cognitive aspects of performance, interrater reliability was higher than for social aspects of performance. Agreement was lower on the pass–fail level than for the distinguished performance scales. Conclusion: These results suggest pass–fail decisions should not be based exclusively on nontechnical skill ratings. We furthermore recommend that regulatory authorities more systematically address interrater reliability in airline instructor training.

However, current head-worn systems provide limited effective fields of view. Wide field of view alternatives promise to increase transfer of training effectiveness through enhanced situation awareness. To test this proposition, this experiment manipulated the pilot's effective field of view and examined subsequent flight performance, which was measured primarily by runway alignment error and vertical track error. Results indicated a significant and quantifiable change in visual scan pattern, head movement, and flight control performance as the effective field of view was sequentially decreased. As field of view decreased, the average visual scan pattern changed to focus less out the window and more on the instruments inside the cockpit. The head range of movement significantly increased below an 80° horizontal × 54° vertical effective field of view as well as significantly decreasing runway alignment and vertical track performance, which occurred below 120° horizontal × 81° vertical effective field of view. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>""]"

To better understand the nature and significance of this process, we conducted 3 empirical studies: a review of National Transportation Safety Board aircraft accident reports, a review of Aviation Safety Reporting System aircraft incident reports, and a simulator experiment. In the accident report study, we determined that CTM errors occurred in 76 (23%) of the 324 accidents we reviewed. We found CTM errors in 231 (49%) of the 470 incident reports we reviewed. In the simulator study, we found that CTM performance was inversely related to workload. We conclude that CTM is significant to flight safety and recommend that this realization be reflected in pilot training, in cockpit procedures, and in research to develop pilot aiding systems.

They must make sure that tasks are started arid stopped at the right times and that undue attention to lower priority tasks does pot prevent the correct and timely completion of higher priority tasks. Just as failure to perform tasks correctly can lead to accidents, failure to manage tasks correctly can have catastrophic consequences as well.

The current luminous efficiency functions are derived from human sensitivity experiments taken at low light levels compared with the outdoor day-time environment. The amount of error induced by extrapolating from low light level data to high light level applications is not known. We sought to determine whether standard luminous efficiency curves CIE V(λ) and CIE Heterochromatic Brightness Matching are appropriate for measuring day-use optical equipment such as display phosphors, lasers, LEDs, and laser eye protection, which are becoming more common in aviation. Methods: Flicker photometry and successive heterochromatic brightness matching were used to measure changes in luminance efficiency functions with increasing levels (1, 10, 100, and 1000 ft.) of light adaptation. Results: Luminous efficiency was found to depend on both the method and the reference intensity with which the measurements were taken. For heterochromatic brightness matching, luminous efficiency increased for longer wavelengths as reference intensity increased. Peak luminous efficiency shifted from approximately 540 nm to greater than 600 nm with increasing intensity. Peak luminous efficiency was constant for flicker photometry across all intensities, but the function narrowed slightly at 100 fL. Conclusion: Luminous efficiency curves measured at high reference intensities are substantially different from the standard luminous efficiency functions. Caution should be used when measuring spectrally narrow and bright sources such as lasers and LEDs with a V(λ) corrected photometer because the measured luminance may correlate poorly with perceived brightness.</abstract>', '<title>Perceived brightness of incandescent and LED aviation signal lights</title> <abstract>Introduction: Aviation signal lights using light emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly perceived as brighter than those using incandescent sources, even at the same measured intensity. In general, saturated colors, like those produced by LEDs, appear brighter than less saturated lights, like those produced by incandescent sources. Methods: We describe a series of experiments quantifying the brightness of simulated blue, white, and green LED signal lights relative to incandescent signal lights of the same hue. Simulated signal lights and arrays were compared against dark and against dimly lighted backgrounds, and through simulated fog. Results: The results confirm that LED signal lights are brighter than incandescent signals at matched luminous intensities. Brightness relationships were unaffected by background light level, and by the number of signals viewed, but the simulated fog reduced the brightness difference between the incandescent and LED signal lights. Conclusions: The present results could not be accurately predicted by several previously published models of brightness appearance, probably because of differences in experimental conditions. We present a new model that can be used to predict signal light brightness for blue, white, and green signal colors. Except for very short-wavelength blue signal lights, the model was able to accurately predict the present brightness data as well as those from previously published independent experiments. This validation lends confidence to the generality of the model for predicting blue, white, and green signal light brightness, but different colors (e.g., yellow or red) remain to be tested and modeled using this approach.

An automatic luminance control for electronic cockpit displays could remove the unnecessary burden of manual display adjustment. This article discusses a research project that investigates the effects of forward field of view (FFOV) luminance and ambient illumination on luminance settings of a liquid crystal display. Forward-looking infrared radar sensor images and a grayscale pattern were presented to pilots. Pilots adapted to the FFOV luminance and were required to adjust the display luminance under various levels of ambient illumination until they could just see the target in the sensor image, or until they could see all 16 levels of the grayscale pattern. A regression analysis was performed and multiple linear regression models were created for both sensor and grayscale data. The models fit the data well, and the equation for sensor data can be used for the development of an algorithm to automatically control luminance. The results are compared with a Boeing automatic brightness control.</abstract>']"

Mean serum cholesterol levels were elevated at three times - during the first week of training, after the first month of the first academic year, and during a week of intense military training in the following spring. Apparently, urate and cholesterol levels were elevated by different aspects of stress. Elevations of uric acid level appeared to reflect stress that excited fear or insecurity.

Methods: Nocturnal HR and HRV and urinary stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline) as well as HR and HRV responses to an orthostatic test on the morning of a parachute jump day or control day were analyzed from 14 novice and 7 experienced parachute jumpers. Results: There were no differences in any HRV indices during the night or the orthostatic test between the jump and control situations. The novices had higher HR than experienced jumpers in the orthostatic test in the morning and also during the jump, but no differences were found between the groups in nocturnal HR and HRV indices or HRV indices during the orthostatic test.

Heart rate was significantly higher among the novice compared to the experienced parachutists, especially during takeoff (125 ± 11 vs. 95 ± 17 beats · min-1, respectively), and upon exit or free fall (184 ± 12 vs. 164 ± 17 boats · min-1, respectively). However, due to the difference in ages between the groups, when expressed relative to maximal heart rate, there was no difference in the heart rote response between groups (e.g., exit/free fall: 93.0 ± 5.5% vs. 88.4 ± 7.8% for novice and experienced, respectively).

A significant correlation (r = 0.72) was observed between heart rate upon landing and the state anxiety scores. These results demonstrate a high psychophysiological stress response to parachuting among both novice and experienced parachutists. It is likely that novice parachutists are stressed to a higher degree and may therefore be mare prone to performance-related injury (e.g., upon landing). However, since both groups reached a similar percentage of their maximal heart rate, they may be at a similar risk of cardiac injury.</abstract>']"

Background: Workload in highly demanding environments can be influenced by the amount of information given to the operator and consequently it is important to limit potential overload. Methods: Participants (highly trained military pilots) completed simulated helicopter flights, which varied in visual conditions and the amount of information given. During these flights, participants also completed a DRT as a measure of cognitive workload. Results: With more visual information available, pilots’ landing accuracy was improved across environmental conditions. The DRT is sensitive to changes in cognitive workload, with workload differences shown between environmental conditions. Increasing symbology appeared to have a minor effect on workload, with an interaction effect of symbology and environmental condition showing that symbology appeared to moderate workload. Conclusion: The DRT is a useful workload measure in simulated helicopter settings. The level of symbology-moderated pilot workload. The increased level of symbology appeared to assist pilots’ flight behavior and landing ability. Results indicate that increased symbology has benefits in more difficult scenarios. Applications: The DRT is an easily implemented and effective measure of cognitive workload in a variety of settings. In the current experiment, the DRT captures the increased workload induced by varying the environmental conditions, and provides evidence for the use of increased symbology to assist pilots. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>']"

Crew performance and co-operation between two pilots are compared in three occurrences of the same task: the results are coherent with the hypothesis of a parallel evolution of the crew performance and its internal co-operation, and show that prescribed explicit co-operation is more present on action than on information about the 'state of the world'. Methodological issues are discussed about the possible effects of the specific situation of training, and about the psychological meaning of the results.</abstract>"", '<title>Analysing human activity development through (work)spaces in a human-centered design project for commercial airline pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper conducts a co-design framework, thanks to different kinds of interviews with expert pilots in different space contexts for each stage of the technical development of the system. Design/methodology/approach: To speak about the question of “spaces” and especially spaces in the design process, this paper is focussed on the transdisciplinary design research for commercial airline pilots. This design research combined a “Human-Centred Design” approach (Boy, 2015) with an occupational psychology, including a “Clinic of Activity” perspective (Kloëtzer et al., 2016). It integrates experts within the research process to design a new technological tool for indicating weather conditions in flight (Boulnois, 2018). Findings: This study explains how the crossed self-confrontation interview under special space conditions allows dialogue to take place between the designers and the pilots for imagining the future workplace by using an emergent workspace. Practical implications: The physical, psychological and social “space” conditions were worked on throughout the design process – including during the work analysis and design testing phases – and were revisited. Originality/value: In this way, the occupational psychologist organised the framework for dialogue about the present situation and future workspaces, to anticipate changes in work organisation, enhance inter-professional collaboration and, finally, increase health and safety benefits for pilots, and potentially other workers, at the same time. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>', '<title>The role of soci(et)al relations in a technology-rich teaching | learning setting: The case of professional development of airline pilots</title> <abstract>Teaching and learning tend to be predominantly investigated in formal (school-like) settings; and many investigations focus on either teaching or on learning.

Workload conditions were created by varying time pressure and external communications requirements. Our interest was in how the pilots strategically managed or adapted to the increasing workload. We independently assessed the pilot's ranking of the priority of different discrete tasks during the approach and landing. Pilots were found to sacrifice some aspects of primary flight control as workload increased. For discrete tasks, increasing workload increased the amount of time in performing the high priority tasks, decreased the time in performing those of lowest priority, and did not affect duration of performance episodes or optimality of scheduling of tasks of any priority level. Individual differences analysis revealed that high-performing subjects scheduled discrete tasks earlier in the flight and shifted more often between different activities. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

One of the most important elements of these courses is a pseudo-pilot (PP) who has active tasks during simulator training. At Eskisehir Technical University (ESTU) PP assignments are made manually to meet the demand of related courses by considering the availability of PP. Even where it is attempted to assign each PP equally in terms of period, personal workloads differ due to the different psychological (mental) and physiological requirements of the simulator tasks. In this study, the PP assignment problem is investigated using mixed-integer programming (MIP). For this purpose, firstly, an equal period assignment to pilots was attempted with a mathematical model, called the Equality of Periods Model (EPM). Then, simulator tasks were weighted using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and an Equality of Workload Model (EWLM) was created based on these weights. Finally, these models were combined to make fair assignments with the Fair Model (FM). The results indicate that the proposed models significantly reduce the differences of workload and working period compared to manual assignment (MA). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>', '<title>Predicting pilot task demand load during final approach</title> <abstract>This research aims at developing a method to assess the safety of airport approaches from the perspective of airline pilots. The main hypothesis is that safety is inversely proportional to the task demand load (TDL) experienced by the pilots conducting it. The TDL is the mental workload imposed by the system to be controlled, and is not to be mistaken for the mental workload experienced by the operator, referred to as mental load. This article presents the results of preliminary research that focused on how some of the environmental factors that determine the approach, such as the type of aircraft and the meteorological conditions, affect the TDL. A paper pilot model, consisting of a scanning model, mental model, and control model, was used to quantify how hard an average pilot has to work to conduct the specified approach. Offline computer simulations with this model revealed some clear trends in pilot scanning rate, task error, and control activity, as a function of the environmental factors, which will eventually allow for a prediction and quantification of the TDL. Depending on the approach performance requirements on the one hand, and the pilot scanning capacity on the other, increasing turbulence intensity showed a change in trend for all TDL-related parameters at a particular turbulence intensity. Results from a pilot- in-the-loop evaluation, conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator, supported the main trends of the offline simulation trials. They also indicated that through adopting different scanning strategies, pilots can leverage their workload; more research is necessary to clarify this result, however. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Workload during approaches: Comparison of simulated standard and noise-abatement profiles</title> <abstract>duction: A new noise-reduced landing approach was tested-a Segmented Continuous Descent Approach (SCDA)-with regard to the resulting workload on pilots. Methods: Workload of 40 pilots was measured using physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blink frequency, saliva Cortisol concentration) and psychological (fatigue, sleepiness, tension, and task load) parameters. Approaches were conducted in A320 and A330 full-flight simulators during night shift. SCDA was compared to the standard Low Drag Low Power (LDLP) procedure as reference. Results: Mean heart rate and blood pressure during the SCDA were not elevated, but were partly, even significantly, reduced (on average by 5 bpm and 4 mmHg from the flying captain). Cortisol levels did not change significantly with mean values of 0.9 to 1.2 ng • ml-1. Landing was the most demanding segment of both approaches as indicated by significant increases in heart rate and decreases in blink frequency. Subjective task load was low. Discussion: Both approach procedures caused a similar workload level. Interpreting the results, methodological limitations have to be considered, e.g., the artificial and controlled airspace situation in the flight simulator. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that under these ideal conditions, the SCDA is operable without a higher workload for pilots compared to the common LDLP.

In some cases, they could even cause an accident. Our study examines the causes of sudden in-flight incapacitation in Air France pilots and flight engineers from 1968-88. Ten cases were reported out of a population of 1,800 cockpit crew, each flying an average of 600 h/year. These incapacitations were due to cardiac disorders (1 atrial fibrillation, 1 sinus tachycardia), epileptic attacks (2 generalized seizures), duodenal hemorrhages (2cases), infection (1 case of severe vertigo due to viral labyrinthitis), metabolic disorders (1 case of hypoglycemia), and sometimes disorders affecting the whole crew (1 case of hypoxia due to a pressurization deficiency, 1 case of CO<inf>2</inf> intoxication caused by the inadequate packaging of a container refrigerated in dry ice) Seven times out of ten, incapacitations occurred during cruising, twice during approach, and once on the ground before starting up, with closed doors (CO<inf>2</inf> intoxication). Two of these incapacitations led to flight diversions. None of them caused an accident. In this series, incapacitations of a cardiac nature were rarer and less serious than those caused by gastrointestinal or neurological disorders. Prevention is based on detection during systematic medical check-ups, and on crews being trained to recognize subtle incapacitations early and to ensure that the flight continues safely when such a case occurs.</abstract>', ""<title>Panic with a twist: An unusual presentation of combined psychiatric and neurologic symptoms in a tactical jet aviator</title> <abstract>A 28-yr-old Naval F-14 aviator presented with complaints of flight- related anxiety occurring intermittently over an 18-mo period. Symptoms included sensation of strangeness, concern over the welfare of his radar intercept officer, flushing, nausea, and intense need to immediately land the aircraft. He also described a 6-mo history of episodes wherein he would see 'shooting stars' in the periphery of his vision, accompanied by dizziness and disorientation. These latter attacks were always precipitated by head turning, usually in combination with positive Gz maneuvers, and were relieved by head straightening. The anxiety symptoms were consistent with a form of panic attack, but the neurological symptoms provoked further workup. Magnetic resonance cerebral angiogram demonstrated a dominant right vertebral artery and hypoplastic left vertebral artery. All symptoms resolved once the aviator was removed from flying the aircraft. After a year of follow-up with an aviation psychiatrist, he remained asymptomatic and was reassigned to maritime patrol aircraft. This case illustrates a difficult diagnostic, therapeutic, and disposition challenge.

To realize alternations in technicians’ cognition and habit in executing routine checks is vital to identify and set training principles during starting stages of type changes. Method: This study compiled possible alterations for A350XWB maintenance from senior practitioners and then conducted a comprehensive survey of China Airlines A-check crew members. A ranked pair-wise comparison (RPC) approach distinguished the priorities of gaps in crew cognition differences and habit changes. Results: Fuselage anti-collision regulation resulted in larger gaps in cognition and habits. Procedures for powering the electrical system on and off, concepts for fuselage structure and materials, and reports of visual inspection procedures after collisions were the sub-criteria with the most significant changes for all respondents. Senior technicians presented more significant cognition differences with juniors in regulations for safety ranges between ground equipment and fuselage. Crew accumulating specific working experience performed more cautiously and carefully. Conclusion: New knowledge and procedures generated alternations of the crew’s cognition and habit in implementing A350XWB A-checks than previous types.

In this study, respondents\' self-categorization of personal cultural identity, as opposed to passport nationality, was used to determine whether there were cultural diferences in airline pilots\' behaviors. METHOD: A survey with items imported from established scales was distributed to pilots of an international airline to measure pilots\' work values, light management attitudes, and cultural dimensions, with respondents segregated into Western, TCK, or Asian cultural groups. RESULTS: TCKs shared similar work values with Westerners, were similarly individualistic, had comparable preference for shallow command gradients, were similarly pragmatic in self-evaluation of performance under stress, and both had lower dependency and preference for rules and procedures. TCKs scored in the middle between Westerners and Asians in automation preference attitudes, and on the cultural dimensions of power distance and uncertainty avoidance. TCKs did not share any similarities with Asians at all. DISCUSSION: The results show that TCKs were neither assimilated into a mainstream culture, nor culturally ""middle of the pack"" as may be expected from their ""East meets West"" backgrounds. Having identiied TCK pilots\' unique values, attitudes, and dimensions, practical implications include changing training design to better suit TCKs\' cultural characteristics and the adaptation of airline management to cater for TCKs\' work values. © Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>']"

According to prior research on metacognition, the accurate checking of learning is a critical part of improving the quality of human performance. However, only rarely have researchers studied the learning effects of the accurate checking of retrospective confidence judgments (RCJs) during a computer-based military training simulation. In this study, we provided participants feedback screens after they had completed a warning task and identification task in a radar monitoring simulation. There were two groups in this experiment. One group (group A) viewed the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft and the triangular graphs of both RCJ scores and human performance together. The other group (group B) only watched the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft. There was no significant difference in performance improvement between groups A and B for the warning task (Day 1: group A – 0.347, group B – 0.305; Day 2: group A – 0.488, group B – 0.413). However, the identification task yielded a significant difference in performance improvement between these groups (Day 1: group A – 0.174, group B – 0.1555; Day 2: group A – 0.324, group B – 0.199).

However, there have been concerns voiced regarding issues, such as automation surprises, associated with the use of adaptive automation. This study examined the use of psychophysiological self-regulation training with adaptive automation that may help pilots deal with these problems through the enhancement of cognitive resource management skills. Eighteen participants were assigned to 3 groups (self-regulation training, false feedback, and control) and performed resource management, monitoring, and tracking tasks from the Multiple Attribute Task Battery. The tracking task was cycled between 3 levels of task difficulty (automatic, adaptive aiding, manual) on the basis of the electroencephalogram-derived engagement index. The other two tasks remained in automatic mode that had a single automation failure. Those participants who had received self-regulation training performed significantly better and reported lower National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores than participants in the false feedback and control groups.

Methods: The study population consisted of 502 pilots who participated in the MORE Energy study. Included risk factors were either measured through an online questionnaire or provided by the company. The outcome of this study, fatigue, was assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and was defined as scoring more than 76 points on this questionnaire.

Results: Of the participating pilots, 29.5\xa0% scored more than 76 points on the CIS and were classified as being fatigued.

Aims: This study attempted to ascertain how much subjective fatigue short-haul pilots reported, and makes comparisons between low-cost and scheduled airline pilots. Methods: Pilots completed anonymous questionnaires (encompassing aviation factors, flight experience and a fatigue scale) posted on the Professional Pilots' Rumours Network website.

This study attempts to demonstrate an empirical relationship between pilot schedules and aviation accidents. Method: Data for human factors-related accidents and pilot work patterns were identified. The distribution of pilot work schedule parameters for the accidents was compared to that for all pilots using a chi-square test to determine if the proportions of accidents and length of duty exposure were the same. If the distributions are the same, then one could infer that pilot human factor accidents are not affected by work schedule parameters. Results: The proportion of accidents associated with pilots having longer duty periods is higher than the proportion of longer duty periods for all pilots. Discussion: There is a discernible pattern of increased probability of an accident as duty time increases for commercial aircraft pilots in the United States. Impact on Industry: The analysis suggests that establishing limits on duty time for commercial pilots would reduce risk. Such a rule is likely to be expensive and could substantially impact the commercial airlines. In return, there is likely to be a reduction in the risk of commercial aviation accidents due to pilot fatigue. © 2003 National Safety Council and Elsevier Science Ltd.

The mental health of airline pilots plays a significant role in their occupational health and overall performance. It is also vital for ensuring the safe operation of aircrafts. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that may improve the mental health of pilots. This study investigates the relationship between proactive coping, perceived stress, social support, and mental health among airline pilots during China's regular prevention and control of COVID-19. Using a sample consisting of 285 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model to explore whether, how, and when proactive coping affects the mental health of pilots. The results show that proactive coping has a direct and positive effect on pilots' mental health, as well as an indirect effect on mental health through its influence on perceived stress. Social support was found to weaken the relationship between perceived stress and mental health. It also weakened the indirect relationship between proactive coping and mental health through perceived stress. These findings advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that affect the mental health of pilots.

Eighteen commercial pilots voluntarily participated in a 2-day training course on QCT followed by 2 months of self-regulated QCT practicing during controlled rest in the flight deck and day-to day life. There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots’ psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots’ mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique. Practitioner summary: QCT breathing has been proven to increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental/physical capacity and sustaining positive emotions to deal with the challenges both on the flight deck and in everyday life.HIGHLIGHTS Pilots have suffered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across many factors including social, economic, mental, physical, emotional, and operational issues Biofeedback training can increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental and physical capacity Self-regulated practicing QCT to form a habitual behaviour is required to sustain the maximum benefits either in the flight or day-to-day life QCT is an effective intervention for aviation authorities and airline operators to develop peer support programs to increase pilots’ fatigue resilience. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although pilots’ physical and mental health problems have become increasingly prominent, their health has not been taken seriously. This study aimed to clarify challenges and support needs related to psychological and physical health among pilots to inform development of a more scientific and comprehensive physical and mental health system for civil aviation pilots. Methods: This qualitative study recruited pilots from nine civil aviation companies. Focus group interviews via an online conference platform were conducted in August 2022. Colaizzi analysis was used to derive themes from the data and explore pilots’ experiences, challenges, and support needs. Results: The main sub-themes capturing pilots’ psychological and physical health challenges were: (1) imbalance between family life and work; (2) pressure from assessment and physical examination eligibility requirements; (3) pressure from worries about being infected with COVID-19; (4) nutrition deficiency during working hours; (5) changes in eating habits because of the COVID-19 pandemic; (6) sleep deprivation; (7) occupational diseases; (8) lack of support from the company in coping with stress; (9) pilots’ yearly examination standards; (10) support with sports equipment; (11) respecting planned rest time; and (12) isolation periods. Discussion: The interviewed pilots experienced major psychological pressure from various sources, and their physical health condition was concerning. We offer several suggestions that could be addressed to improve pilots’ physical and mental health. However, more research is needed to compare standard health measures for pilots around the world in order to improve their physical and mental health and contribute to overall aviation safety. © © 2024 Xu, Bao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Li, Jin, Chen, Duan, Shi, Wang, Lu, Chen, Gao, Han, Ren, Su and Xiang.</abstract>']"

Background: Previous research has focused on human trust of automation during simulated ground combat and human trust of civil aviation automation. Those studies largely consisted of subjective measures of trust analyzed post-hoc. Human trust of autonomy in high-risk situations such as dogfighting had not yet been studied. Method: Nine evaluation pilots participated in an experiment that consisted of nine operationally relevant live-flight vignettes during which they conducted a mission manager task while simultaneously monitoring an autonomous agent controlling their own-ship in an aerial dogfight. Eye tracking, objective real-time mental workload, and mission manager task performance were all recorded. Results: Potential indicators of trust were objectively measured in real-time as a function of autonomy disengagement, human cross-check ratio of autonomy, and real-time objective mental workload, as validated by traditional subjective trust measures. Measured trust still needs to be categorized as appropriate trust, overtrust, or undertrust in future work. Conclusion: This first-ever real-time measure of objective indicators of trust in operationally relevant live-flight paves the way for determining appropriate human trust of autonomy in high-risk situations such as dogfighting. These measures could have utility in high-risk manned-unmanned teaming applications such as working with robots and automated trading. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Trust of an automatic ground collision avoidance technology: A fighter pilot perspective</title> <abstract>The present study examined the antecedents of trust among operational Air Force fighter pilots for an automatic ground collision avoidance technology.

The 5-factor model includes organizational commitment, management involvement, pilot empowerment, reporting systems, and accountability systems as they pertain to safety within an airline. The Commercial Aviation Safety Survey, designed around these 5 factors, was distributed to pilots and managers of a large U.S. airline for anonymous completion. A total of 503 completed surveys were obtained for further analysis (29% return rate). Results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the original 5-factor model of safety culture did not fit as well as hypothesized. Additional exploratory analyses were then conducted to determine specific areas of misalignment of the data with the model. Results from these analyses and respondent comments informed a conceptual revision of the model and survey. The new model contains 4 main factors and 11 subfactors.

We examined (i) whether safety culture can be reliably measured within a single industry operating across different cultural environments, and (ii) if there is an association between safety culture and national culture. The psychometric properties of a safety culture model developed for the air traffic management (ATM) industry were examined in 17 European countries from four culturally distinct regions of Europe (North, East, South, West). Participants were ATM operational staff (n = 5,176) and management staff (n = 1,230). Through employing multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, good psychometric properties of the model were established. This demonstrates, for the first time, that when safety culture models are tailored to a specific industry, they can operate consistently across national boundaries and occupational groups. Additionally, safety culture scores at both regional and national levels were associated with country-level data on Hofstede's five national culture dimensions (collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation). MANOVAs indicated safety culture to be most positive in Northern Europe, less so in Western and Eastern Europe, and least positive in Southern Europe.

One hundred eighty-eight international pilots responded to a questionnaire that assessed overall fatigue and the symptoms pilots associated with fatigue on duty. The questionnaire also assessed the methods used by pilots to cope with fatigue before a duty as well as on the flight deck. Analysis showed that these symptoms could be grouped into five factors: sleepiness, cognitive dysfunction, emotional disturbance, boredom, and physical effects. Pilots reporting high levels of overall fatigue differed from other pilots in terms of noticing symptoms related to cognitive difficulties and emotional disturbance. The most common coping strategies used prior to a duty involved napping and conserving energy. Coping strategies used by pilots on the flight deck could be grouped into five factors: planning energy use, active coping, mental withdrawal, communicating with other crew, and coffee drinking. In their coping strategies during flights, high-fatigue pilots differed from other crew in their higher use of energy planning. The study suggests that pilots reporting high levels of fatigue may use different sensations to monitor when they are tired. Modifying some of the less functional coping strategies used by high-fatigue pilots may be a useful point of intervention to reduce fatigue.</abstract>']"

Duration of martial discord ranged from 1-10 years with an average of 2.25 years. The most frequent problem noted was one of communication, with authoritarian or controlling styles predominating. The second most frequent conflict concerned occupational demands; both pilots and spouses complained about frequent work-related separations. Nine of ten distressed outcomes (i.e., separated or divorced) were initiated by the wife.

The presence of clutter inhibited detection of command changes and traffic in both head-up and head-down conditions. Lowlighting the task-irrelevant clutter did not facilitate detection of commanded changes, however, the clutter cost for detecting traffic was diminished if the added information was lowlighted in the head-down location.

Six commercial pilots flew simulated approaches under varied workload conditions with low-, medium-, and high-clutter head-up displays, rating the perceived clutter and subjective mental workload associated with each display configuration. Results revealed that high-clutter displays produced elevated reports of perceived clutter and workload due to information density or redundancy, whereas low-clutter displays were perceived as less cluttered but challenging to use due to lack of relevant information typically used during flight. A multidimensional measure of clutter was found to be more sensitive to display differences than an overall perceived rating of clutter, and low-level visual display properties were successful in predicting clutter perceptions and pilot performance.

Hypothesis: Over-accommodation is caused not by the presence of a head-up display per se, but rather by the cognitive demand of the task. Methods: The effect of increasing the task cognitive load and the use of forward looking infra-red imagery (FLIR) on the ocular accommodative response and task performance was assessed with a realistic head-up display assisted flying task. FLIR increases cognitive load due to its poor resolution and the need for interpretation of the images. Results: Over- accommodation was found to be small in magnitude (0.17 ± 0.03D; range - 0.02-0.45D) occurring only with cognitively demanding tasks and with forward looking infrared imagery. Response times to detect tanks in the outside world scene were slower with increased cognitive load and forward looking infra- red imagery, along with a reduced detection rate, decreased accuracy of tracking tanks in the outside world and poorer control of the head-up display pitch ladder. When discrimination was added to detection in an outside world task, decisions were delayed until they could be accurately made, rather than performance degraded. Conclusion: The use of a virtual head-up display in a simulated aircraft environment did not adversely affect ocular accommodation. However, increased cognitive demand or FLIR imagery caused significant inward shifts of accommodation.</abstract>']"

Although there is no gold standard tool for its assessment, Yoshitake's Feeling of Fatigue Scale (FFS) appears promising for application to fighter pilots as it has already been validated for Brazilian commercial airline pilots. The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the FFS in Brazilian fighter pilots. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, carried out between March-August 2023, with 58 fighter pilots operating F-5M and JAS 39E aircraft. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the FFS, and the Samn-Perelli Scale were applied in two moments with a maximum interval of 7 d between them. The reliability/reproducibility and agreement of the instrument were evaluated using Cronbach's α, Cohen's κ test (for categorical variables), and the intraclass correlation coefficient for numerical variables in the test-retest. Criterion validation was carried out using the Samn-Perelli Scale. Data were also analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences statistical software, version 25.0. RESULTS: The instrument presents good reliability, being suitable for evaluating the domains of drowsiness [a = 0.840, F = 6.241, confidence interval (CI): 0.576-0.827], concentration (a = 0.907, F = 10.739, CI: 0.726-0.894) and physical discomfort (a = 0.747, F = 3.948, CI: 0.385-0.730). The criterion validity analysis showed that the FFS is valid and accurate for assessing mental fatigue in Brazilian fighter pilots.

Despite the rigorous selection of military pilots, those factors predispose to failures in physiological compensatory mechanisms and metabolic flexibility. Objectives: We compared through NMR-based metabolomics the metabolic profile of Brazilian F5 fighter pilots with different flight experiences vs. the control group of non-pilots. We hypothesized that combat pilots have metabolic flexibility associated with combat flight time. Methods: We evaluated for the first time 34 Brazilian fighter pilots from Santa Cruz Air Base (Rio de Janeiro, RJ) allocated into three groups: pilots with lower total accumulated flight experience < 1,100\xa0h (PC1, n = 7); pilots with higher total accumulated flight experience ≥ 1,100\xa0h (PC2, n = 6); military non-pilots (CONT, n = 21). Data collection included anthropometric measurements, total blood count, lipidogram, markers of oxidative stress, and serum NMR-based metabolomics. Results: In comparison with controls (p < 0.05), pilots exhibited decreased levels of white blood cells (−13%), neutrophils (−15%), lymphocytes (−20%), alfa-glucose (−13%), lactate (−26%), glutamine (−11%), histidine (−20%), and tyrosine (−11%), but higher isobutyrate (+ 10%) concentrations. Significant correlations were found between lactate vs. amino acids in CONT (r = 0.55–0.68, p < 0.001), and vs. glutamine in PC2 (r = 0.94, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Fighter pilots with lower experience showed a dysregulation in immune-metabolic function in comparison with controls, which seemed to be counteracted by the accumulation of flight hours. Those findings might have implications for the health preservation and operational training of fighter pilots. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract>', '<title>Variations in mood states among Brazilian air force pilots: a crossover analysis between operational and aerobatic flight missions</title> <abstract>Background: Aerobatic flight maneuvers expose military pilots to a confluence of physiological and psychological stressors—including sustained G-forces, vestibular disorientation, and neuromuscular fatigue—that may acutely modulate emotional states and compromise cognitive performance. However, the differential psychometric impact of routine operational flights versus high-intensity air demonstrations remains poorly characterized. Purpose: To examine and compare mood state fluctuations elicited by distinct aerial mission profiles—operational maintenance (OM) flights and aerobatic demonstrations (AD)—within a specialized military pilot cohort. Methods: In this within-subject, crossover experimental design, nine elite male aviators (mean age: 32.1 ± 1.8 years) from the Brazilian Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron (EDA), each with >1,000 cumulative flight hours, were assessed across two mission contexts. Mood states were measured pre- and post-flight using the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), which evaluates six psychological dimensions: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Paired comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Results: OM flights were associated with a statistically significant increase in depression scores post-flight (p = 0.031), alongside a non-significant trend toward decreased tension (p = 0.098). Other subscales showed no statistically significant variation, though intra-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Emotional reactivity among high-performance military pilots varies according to mission typology. Incorporating continuous affective monitoring and routine psychological assessments may bolster both operational readiness and mental health preservation in high-demand aviation environments. © © 2025 Santana, Pivetta, Da Silva, Campos, Farinatti, Almeida, Verame, Brandão and Figueira Junior.</abstract>']"

We studied this assumption in 170 flight surgeons who varied in age, experience, and whether or not they were presently in training or had already completed training in flight medicine. Measures of interest in psychiatry and self-assessed ability in seven areas of psychiatric skills and knowledge were obtained. Results indicate that age and experience are unrelated to interest in psychiatry, while being in training has a significant negative impact.

Background: Aircraft maintenance is a vital aspect of aviation, with failures in aircraft maintenance linked to one third of aircraft malfunctions. Research within other high-risk industries indicates the importance of non-technical skills in ensuring effective performance and reducing the risk of error. Method: A mixed-methods approach was used: Aircraft maintenance workers from 2 locations (Scotland and England, n\xa0=\xa024) were interviewed using the critical incident technique. A short survey was then distributed (n\xa0=\xa031) to further explore worker perceptions of non-technical skill usage across different organizational locations. Results: The interviews identified team-based non-technical skills as Situation awareness, decision making, leadership, teamwork and communication, and task management. Lone worker non-technical skills were identified as Situation awareness, decision making, and task management. The questionnaire study indicated that perception of task management was significantly more negative than for situation awareness, leadership, teamwork, and communication. Moreover, participants from Scottish units were significantly more positive about situation awareness and teamwork than their English counterparts. Conclusion: The results indicate that non-technical skills are an important aspect of aircraft maintenance workers’ work performance and safety, mirroring the findings reported within other high-risk industries.

Background: Effective communication can have a positive contribution to safety in the aviation maintenance industry. In concert with trust, communication can also influence the detection of failures during the practice of maintenance in a civil and military aviation environment. Method: This study explores the association between three factors: communication satisfaction, interpersonal trust and trust toward aviation maintenance maintenance software. To this end, a survey was conducted to diverse set of aviation maintenance professionals. A quantitative analysis was performed on the data collected, to identify possible interrelations among the three factors examined. Results: For managers and subordinates, results showed that a substantial proportion of their communication satisfaction was explained by their levels of interpersonal trust. Differences in the communication satisfaction and software trust, between military and civil employees were also observed. The results of civil employees exhibit higher mean scores than that of military for all three factors. Overall, communication satisfaction was found to have a stronger association with interpersonal than with software trust.

In particular, cabin crew members who must deal with foreign passengers and a team of foreign coworkers are more prone to develop job burnout from their cross-cultural encounters. Therefore, having cross-cultural competence, which can help them to deal effectively with such situations, is crucial to preventing the problem of burnout. Cultural intelligence (CQ) was proposed in this research as a cross-cultural competence, essential for cabin crew members. The objective of the research was to examine the relationship between the CQ of the cabin crew members and the level of job burnout which they experience. Survey data were collected from a sample of 320 Thai cabin crew members, from seven non-Thai national airlines. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results supported the negative relationship between the CQ of cabin crew members and their job burnout. The moderating effect analysis also showed that the negative effect of CQ on burnout was particularly strong for cabin crew members with greater job tenure than those with lower job tenure. The results not only provide additional insight regarding the contribution of CQ to employee wellbeing in the airline industry, but also suggest some moderating conditions that could make CQ particularly essential for cabin crew members.

Empirical data were collected from 183 flight attendants with over 1 year of experience in the airline industry. Initial responses were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, revealing that burnout symptoms are driven by four factors: physical, emotional, socio-relational, and attitudinal. Subsequent data analysis indicated that all four factors significantly impact absenteeism and turnover intentions. Furthermore, emotional intelligence was found to play a significant moderating role in the relationship between burnout symptoms and absenteeism. As burnout symptoms increase, absenteeism levels rise, leading to higher turnover intentions. Finally, absenteeism was found to lead to turnover intentions.

Results: The data revealed that flight examiners used the documentary method, where initial observations are treated as documentary evidence of underlying phenomena (e.g., situational awareness, decision making) while presupposing these phenomena for making and categorizing the observations. Flight examiners, using a variety of techniques, actively create situations for obtaining additional observations that further substantiate the presupposed underlying phenomena.

This wonderful progress, which should continue at an exponentially increasing pace as we move into the 21st century, sets the stage for another revolution - in the scientific formulation of intentional behavior. Just as applied sciences such as fluid mechanics and solid-state electronics benefitted from breakthroughs in physics, so it may be expected that social psychology and economics, for example, will similarly benefit from our expanding knowledge of psychosomatic and psychological function. Economics, however, with its basic concepts dating from the nineteenth century, must endure an extensive renewal. Toward this end, a new mathematical theory of behavior was formulated in the early 1990s based on the contributions of prominent psychologists and economists over the past two centuries. Presentation of the new approach at international conferences continued in 2000 with attention moving beyond the fundamentals into macroeconomic concerns including business cycles, productivity, and unemployment.</abstract>"", '<title>Conceptions of cognition for cognitive engineering</title> <abstract>Cognitive processes, cognitive psychology tells us, unfold in our heads. In contrast, several approaches in cognitive engineering argue for a shift of unit of analysis from what is going on in the heads of operators to the workings of whole socio-technical systems. This shift is sometimes presented as part of the development of a new understanding of what cognition is and where the boundaries of cognitive systems are. Cognition, it is claimed, is not just situated or embedded, but extended and distributed in the world. My main question in this article is what the practical significance is of this framing of an expanded unit of analysis in a cognitive vocabulary. I focus on possible consequences for how cognitive engineering practitioners think about function allocation in system design, and on what the relative benefits and costs are of having a common framework and vocabulary for talking about both human and technical system components. I argue for what I call an expansive but deflated conception of cognition, primarily on pragmatic grounds. In addition, I claim that the important lesson of the ""boundaries of cognition"" debate in cognitive science is the negative claim that there is not anything special about the biological boundary of the skin and skull per se, rather than some positive claim about where the boundaries of extended or distributed cognitive systems really are. I also examine the role of the concept of cognition in the theoretical frameworks of distributed cognition, joint cognitive systems (also known as cognitive system engineering), and cognitive work analysis. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>', '<title>Industry Application of Behavioral Science</title> <abstract>One of the more significant errors in the history of science occurred during the ""marginal revolution"" in economics near the end of the nineteenth century. Rather than explicitly recognize in basic theory that the happiness we seek to maximize in life originates within oneself, the early theorists formulated their equations as though human satisfaction resided in external things - as in so much utility (economist\'s term for satisfaction) per pound of sugar. Over the past 125 years, economists have developed mainstream mathematical economics on this incorrect basis resulting in the ill-founded neoclassical Equilibrium Theory. Because of this error economic theory is fundamentally timeless. The present theory, in its canonical form, corrects the early marginalist\'s error by identifying utility (time-integrated pleasure) exclusively with the stream-of-consciousness attending (expected) mental and physical activity. Time is now explicit in basic theory, thereby allowing, for the first time, the substantive computer-modeling of time-dependent, small- and large-scale economic systems. Furthermore, this new approach is methodologically compatible with mainstream sociology and institutional economics, allowing increased interdisciplinary cooperation that may influence policy -and thereby affect industry and markets. And safety engineering stands to benefit from the accommodation of neuropsychology in understanding human error in the supervision and control of technology.</abstract>']"

U.S. Army aviators undergo a rigorous initial screening process followed by annual medical evaluations governed by published standards of medical fitness which are updated periodically. An aeromedical summary is submitted for disqualifying conditions, resulting in either a waiver of the standard or suspension of flight status. This study aimed to identify the most common disqualifying medical conditions in U.S. Army aviators in recent years and analyze trends over time. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed using 5 yr of data from the U.S. Army’s Aeromedical Epidemiological Data Repository. Incidence rates for the 10 most common disqualifying conditions, and the waiver approval rate for those conditions, were calculated. Annual incidence was calculated for hypertension aeromedical summary submissions. RESULTS: L umbar and cervical spinal disorders (101.55 and 39.26 per 10,000 aviator-years, 81.6% and 79.1% waived, respectively), obstructive sleep apnea (62.00 per 10,000 aviator-years, 93.4% waived), hearing loss (27.96 per 10,000 aviator-years, 98.0% waived), and hypertension (26.13 per 10,000 aviator-years, 97.3% waived) were the most common conditions submitted. Psychological diagnoses were also common, with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and phobias, adjustment disorder, and mood disorders having a cumulative incidence of 44.20 per 10,000 aviator-years and a waiver rate of 45.4%. Submissions for hypertension substantially decreased starting in 2019. DISCUSSION: S pine disorders are among the leading disqualifying conditions in U.S. Army aviators and metabolic conditions were submitted less often than previously reported, likely due to changes in aeromedical policy with respect to hypertension. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>', ""<title>Medical Suspension in Female Army Rotary-Wing Aviators</title> <abstract>Introduction Female aviators with health conditions may face a variety of occupational impacts. Outcomes may include a waiver for continued flight or a permanent suspension, in which flight is no longer possible. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of medical diagnosis among female U.S. Army aviators over a ten year period and identify associations of clinical diagnoses leading to waiver or permanent suspension. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary data analysis; data were retrieved on 1,282 female, rated aviator patients from an Army Aviation epidemiological database. The archival dataset was composed of a total of 6,856 cases between June 2005 and June 2015. Age ranged from 19 to 58 years. The data were examined in terms of raw ICD-9 diagnostic codes, grouped system diagnoses (diagnosis categories), and occupational consequence. Spearman's rho correlations were used to determine associations between diagnosis, waiver and permanent suspension. Results The leading diagnoses were pregnancy, normal delivery, and allergic rhinitis. The systems approach yielded pregnancy, orthopedic disorders, and spinal disorders as the leading diagnosis categories. Leading waivered conditions included spinal, psychiatric, and neurological disorders. In terms of permanent suspension, the leading cause was depression, followed by migraine and post-traumatic stress disorders. In almost all diagnostic groupings, the Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between age and diagnosis were positively related. However, age was not associated with negative occupational outcome (permanent suspension), generally. Conclusions A variety of conditions negatively impact the health and occupational status of female aviators, with disparate occupational impacts. Prevalent conditions differed from those reported previously for all aviators in a predominantly male population. The absence of cardiovascular disease is a significant change from 20-30 years ago. Among all medical diagnoses, a minority are responsible for a greater occupational burden. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.</abstract>"", '<title>Panic disorder in military aviators: A retrospective study of prevalence</title> <abstract>Introduction: The occurrence of panic disorder (PD) among military pilots and navigators poses questions with respect to medical care and waiver policy, but the prevalence of such disorders is unclear. We studied the epidemiology of PD in a USAF aircrew population. Methods: Occurrence of PD during the period 2001-2008 was determined using the USAF Aeromedical Information Management Waiver Tracking System, a database containing medical disqualifications and waivers for the entire population of both qualified and disqualified (grounded) USAF aviators. Results: The mean annual USAF pilot and navigator population averaged 17,727 during the study period. The database yielded nine cases labeled as PD. After records review by two experienced aeromedical psychiatrists, only three of the nine cases met diagnostic criteria for PD. Estimated annual PD prevalence was 0.002% (2/100,000) in USAF pilots and navigators. Annual prevalence of PD was 2.7% in the general U.S. population 18 yr of age and older and 2.4% in a group of manager/professionals. Odds ratios were 1228 (55/27,269) and 1089 (49/24,175) for the general population and manager/professionals, respectively. Discussion: One of three individuals with PD received a waiver to resume flying after successful treatment. Five of the six cases not meeting criteria for PD (but suffering from varying degrees of situational and/or stress related anxiety) were flying with waivers. The negligible annual PD prevalence in USAF pilots and navigators likely reflects lower aircrew vulnerability to PD because of selection and training processes and does not pose a disease burden upon force strength. © by the Aerospace Medical Association,.</abstract>']"

To meet this requirement, airlines often use prerecorded briefings, in the form of audio or video, which can sometimes be supplemented with a live demonstration. Method: One hundred and sixty-two participants were randomly divided into 5 groups—control (no briefing), audio only, audio plus live demonstration, video only, and video plus live demonstration—and exposed to a prerecorded safety briefing. Recall performance in terms of key safety messages was analyzed postbriefing, as well as changes in mood from pre- to postbriefing. Results: Recall of certain key safety information is related to both cabin crew members and the medium in which the safety material is delivered.

Slightly more than one-third of the AL cards (n=460) included an incentive for making the announcement. Results: Without the incentive, compliance to give the buckle-up reminder was 35.5% of 798 flights. With the incentive, compliance was significantly higher (i.e., 53.3%).

Background: The pre-flight safety briefing is a required presentation that must be administered to all passengers before conducting a flight. This briefing is most commonly delivered via a live demonstration by flight attendants or through the aircraft’s in-flight entertainment system, such as a seatback video. Method: Using a sample of 876 participants from the United States, we examined the influence of familiarity, anticipatory flight anxiety, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and frequency of flying on willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing. The study used a quantitative correlational design with structural equation modeling techniques for data analysis. Results: The results supported 5 of the 7 hypotheses. High levels of flight anxiety resulted in less willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing. Significant positive relationships were found between familiarity, conscientiousness, agreeableness on the willingness to watch. A strong relationship between willingness to watch and stated actual watching also was found. Conclusions: The study’s findings provide insight into what factors influence a passenger’s willingness to watch and examine the role personality factors have on willingness.

These changes have been attributed to workload and to psychological or emotional stress. This paper examines a number of test pilots' heart rate responses recorded during various flight trials involving different types of aircraft. Examples include ramp takeoffs in a VTOL fighter, automatic landings in fog, supersonic flight through monsoon rain, and a sortie in which the pilot developed acute appendicitis. It is concluded that heart rate responses in experienced pilots are influenced almost entirely by workload-related factors and not by emotional stressors, such as risk and anxiety.

Marijuana is used for its euphoric and relaxing properties. However, marijuana use has been shown to result in impaired memory, cognitive skills and psychomotor function. The Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute conducts toxicological analysis on aviation fatalities. Due to severe trauma associated with aviation accidents, blood is not always available; therefore, the laboratory must rely on specimens other than blood for toxicological analysis in ~30-40% of cases. However, the postmortem distribution of cannabinoids has not been well characterized. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the distribution of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and its metabolites, 11-hydroxytetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) and THC-COOH, in postmortem fluid and tissue specimens from 11 fatal aviation accident cases (2014-2015) previously found positive for cannabinoids. Specimens evaluated, when available, included: blood, urine, vitreous humor, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, muscle, brain, heart and bile. We developed and validated (following SWGTOX guidelines) a sensitive and robust method using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH in postmortem fluids and tissues. The method readily identified and quantified these cannabinoids in postmortem fluids and tissues below 1 ng/mL. Qualitative cannabinoid results within each case were comparable between blood and non-blood specimens. However, there was no consistent distribution of the cannabinoids between blood and any other fluids or tissues.

Future work will explore the use of real-time eye-tracking data to deliver immediate feedback, guiding pilots visual focus during training. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>', '<title>Visual scanning and pilot expertise: The role of attentional flexibility and mental model development</title> <abstract>In order to examine differences in flying expertise, 12 novice and 12 expert pilots flew a 7-segment simulation pattern under specific: attentional constraints while cockpit instrument visual scan was recorded. Flight segments involved various combinations of maneuvering of heading, altitude and airspeed. Expert pilots performed better than novices on vertical and longitudinal, but not lateral control. They accomplished their superior vertical tracking by allocating more control resources to the vertical control. Analyses of scanning strategies revealed that experts: a) had shorter dwells and more frequent visits to most instruments; b) adapted their visiting strategy more flexibly in response to changing task demands; c) demonstrated a better mental model of cross-coupling and predictive relations between and within axes; and d) showed more frequent checking of axes whose values remained constant. The data is discussed in terms of their implications in pilot cockpit scan training program development.</abstract>', '<title>Assessing Expertise Using Eye Tracking in a Virtual Reality Flight Simulation</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this work was to examine the fidelity and validity of an aviation simulation using eye tracking. Background: Commercial head-mounted virtual reality (VR) systems offer a convenient and cost-effective alternative to existing aviation simulation (e.g., for refresher exercises). We performed pre-implementation testing of a novel aviation simulation, designed for head-mounted VR, to determine its fidelity and validity as a training device. Method: Eighteen airline pilots, with varying levels of flight experience, completed a sequence of training ‘flows.’ Self-reported measures of presence and workload and users’ perceptions of fidelity were taken. Pilots’ eye movements and performance were recorded to determine whether more experienced pilots showed distinct performance and eye gaze profiles in the simulation, as they would in the real-world. Results: Real-world expertise correlated with eye gaze patterns characterized by fewer, but longer, fixations and a scan path that was more structured and less random. Multidimensional scaling analyses also indicated differential clustering of strategies in more versus less experienced pilots. Subjective ratings of performance, however, showed little relationship with real-world expertise or eye movements. Conclusion: We adopted an evidence-based approach to assessing the fidelity and validity of a VR flight training tool. Pilot reports indicated the simulation was realistic and potentially useful for training, while direct measurement of eye movements was useful for establishing construct validity and psychological fidelity of the simulation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Results: Professional pilots were found to be heavier drinkers than private pilots and were also more likely to infringe the 0.02% BAC rule.

Similar questions were included regarding marijuana use. Respondents were much more conservative in their attitudes toward the use of alcohol prior to flying than prior to driving. This relationship held both for the number of drinks judged safe 3 h prior to flying or driving and for estimates of the waiting interval that would be appropriate following alcohol consumption. In addition, attitudes toward alcohol use were related to respondents' own drinking behavior, with moderate and heavy drinkers more tolerant of alcohol use in flying and driving situations than abstainers.</abstract>"", ""<title>Some considerations for the development of effective countermeasures to aircrew use of alcohol while flying</title> <abstract>A revision to the Joint Airworthiness Authorities' Operations Regulations now imposes a maximum Blood Alcohol Concentration limit of just 0.02% on U.K. pilots.

In this research, we extended the concept of situation awareness and task performance from the traditional intracockpit crew focus to an intercockpit team perspective. That extension necessitated the development of evaluation instruments that link events, which affect the multiship aviation team, to their situational awareness and task performance.

The complementary information distribution is intended to foster a complementary mental model that promotes each team member's access to information according to his or her immediate tasks. The hypothesis-that the complementary information distribution would improve performance and team interaction-was tested in a high-fidelity military helicopter flight simulator with 20 Army aviators.

The results were summarized as follows. Eastward flights. Decrease of total sleep time, or increase of TST. Disturbances of intra-sleep cycles. Increase of slow wave sleep. Decrease of REM sleep in the amount. Prolonged REM sleep latency. Westward flights. Shortened sleep latency. Shortened REM sleep latency. Increase of percentage REM sleep. Unusual temporal distributions of REM sleep periods. Southward flight. No significant change. From all above mentioned it becomes evident that after transmeridian flight sleep rhythm is clearly disturbed. In this time we emphasized the changes in particular sleep rather than the overall changes in sleep-wake cycles. The changes in sleep pattern followed by time zone changes, however, are thought to result from a complicated summation of effects, such as sleep deprivation, sleep reversal, naps, shift in sleep onset time, and circadian rhythm alteration. The possible factors about the changes in sleep will be presented by Dr. Endo in the next lecture.</abstract>', '<title>The possible mechanisms of the disturbed circadian sleep-wake rhythm after time zone changes</title> <abstract>Changes in sleep after eastward flight. To go to bed at 2300 hr in SFO, which corresponds to 1600 hr in TYO, means that a traveller from TYO starts his sleep from evening nap in TYO. In evening naps, Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is increased and REM sleep is decreased. In the flight from West to East, however, the subjects experienced one night total sleep deprivation. Consequently, it is necessary to do research on naps after total sleep derivation. REM sleep is clearly increased in the morning and decreased in the evening in spite of one night total sleep deprivation. These findings indicate that the distribution of REM sleep is not affected by total sleep deprivation, but REM sleep has a clear circadian rhythm. By contrast, SWS is increased in the morning, afternoon and evening naps after total sleep deprivation. Thus, SWS is more independent of circadian effects and responsive to the length of prior wakefulness. From the findings mentioned above, it is assumed that the decrease of REM sleep and the increase of SWS in the first part of the sleep in SFO may be caused by effects of one night total sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm of REM sleep. Changes in sleep after westward flight. The sleep after returning home from east after the flight from TYO to LDN was different from that in baseline nights in TYO, with decreased REM sleep latency, appearance of SOREMs and increased REM sleep. Since the sleep after westward flight corresponds to that in the early morning to forenoon in the place before the flight, it is necessary to investigate the effect of sleep reversal and naps in daytime. In naps after one night total sleep deprivation, morning naps and had shortened REM sleep latency, increased REM sleep and frequent SOREMs. From the findings mentioned above, it is suggested that the nocturnal sleep after returning home from east and in LDN may reflect the circadian rhythm of sleep in the place before the start of the flight.</abstract>']"
