2026,China,Threat anticipation and proactive response: The effect of defensive pessimism strategy on pilots' safety behavior,"<title>Threat anticipation and proactive response: The effect of defensive pessimism strategy on pilots' safety behavior</title> <abstract>Human error is a significant cause of aviation accidents, and numerous individual psychological factors strongly influence pilots' safety behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to identify factors that may enhance pilots' safety behavior and explore their underlying mechanisms. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study examines whether, how, and under what conditions defensive pessimism affects pilots' safety behavior from a cognitive strategy perspective. Using a sample of 308 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model between defensive pessimism strategy and pilots' safety behaviors. The results indicate that defensive pessimism strategy has a direct positive effect on pilots' safety behavior and that this relationship is partially mediated by safety attitudes. Additionally, safety culture negatively moderates both the positive relationship between defensive pessimism strategy and safety attitudes and the indirect effects of this cognitive strategy on safety behavior through safety attitudes. On a theoretical level, this study first validates the effectiveness of the defensive pessimism strategy within the high-risk context of aviation safety, thereby advancing the understanding of its unique mechanisms. Second, by elucidating how individuals proactively employ specific cognitive strategies to shape behavioral attitudes and subsequently influence actual behavior, this study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior from a cognitive strategy perspective. Furthermore, it explores the boundary condition of safety culture, deepening our understanding of the interaction between organizational environments and individual cognitive strategies. Finally, on a practical level, this research offers valuable insights for aviation safety management, informing practices related to pilot selection, daily mental health support, and the exploratory development of the defensive pessimism strategy into a potential risk management tool. © 2025 The Authors</abstract>"
2026,France,Predictive validity of cognitive abilities for air traffic controllers selection among proficient scientific candidates,"<title>Predictive validity of cognitive abilities for air traffic controllers selection among proficient scientific candidates</title> <abstract>Most air traffic controllers (ATCO) are selected after high school graduation, partly based on cognitive abilities. On the contrary, French ATCO are selected after an intensive scientific post-secondary program without undergoing cognitive assessment. This study examines the potential incremental validity of cognitive predictors in ATCO training for such proficient applicants. Initial and unit training results were available for 414 and 277 ATCO students, respectively. All students took cognitive ability tests, encompassing visuospatial processing, quantitative knowledge, and work samples. We compared a baseline regression model with academic performance as sole predictor to an extended model with the addition of the cognitive abilities composite score. The R2 of the extended model increased significantly, by 0.04 (p < .001) and 0.06 (p < .001), respectively, for predicting practical initial and unit training outcome. In conclusion, even for scientific proficient candidates, cognitive assessment can enhance the success rate of ATCO training. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract>"
2026,United States,Time for a break? Perceptions and impacts of reconstitution among United States Air Force remotely piloted aircraft personnel,"<title>Time for a break? Perceptions and impacts of reconstitution among United States Air Force remotely piloted aircraft personnel</title> <abstract>United States Air Force remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) aircrew and support personnel perform critical missions in support of military operations around the world. The high value placed on the work of these individuals has resulted in increased workload and heightened risk of adverse psychological health outcomes. The impact of this can be detrimental to the health of the individual as well as the success of the RPA mission. To address these concerns, a combat-to-reconstitution policy was developed to provide additional downtime and recovery to RPA personnel, and recently piloted in some units within the RPA community. A total of 397 RPA personnel, of which 26% (n = 103) indicated their schedule was either internal or external reconstitution, completed an anonymous occupational health assessment sometime between November 2021 and July 2022. Responses included a mixture of both positive and negative experiences during the implementation of reconstitution, along with recommendations for improvements. Certain reconstitution-related sources of stress (e.g. work overload, lack of resources), were found to increase risk of burnout or psychological distress. Overall, this preliminary study provides a foundational landscape for the scientific and operational understanding of reconstitution as an operational intervention to improve recovery. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

2026,China,Unraveling the complex relationships between mental health and safety operation behaviors among pilots: a network and latent profile analysis,"<title>Unraveling the complex relationships between mental health and safety operation behaviors among pilots: a network and latent profile analysis</title> <abstract>As the guardians of aviation safety, pilots’ mental health is critical for ensuring flight safety. However, systematic research on the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots remains scarce, and the relationship between these symptoms and safety operation behaviors is unclear. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the interrelations among mental symptoms in pilots and to explore how these symptoms are associated with safety operation behaviors. A total of 612 male commercial pilots participated in a cross-sectional survey that assessed nine types of mental symptoms and safety operation behaviors. Descriptive statistics, network analysis, and latent profile analysis were utilized to examine their relationships systematically. The study revealed significant interconnections among mental symptoms in pilots, with obsessive-compulsive symptoms playing a pivotal role in the comorbidity network. Pilots were categorized into three groups based on symptom severity: high-, medium-, and low-level symptom groups. Pilots in the high-level symptom group exhibited significantly poorer safety operation behaviors. Nearly half of the mental symptoms are indirectly linked to safety operation behaviors through comorbidities, and these comorbidities have a direct association with these behaviors. In the low-level symptom group, there was greater integration among safety operation behaviors, whereas the high-level symptom group showed dissociation. In the high-level symptom group, interpersonal communication and cooperation played a key role, while the role of understanding the automated system was weaker, which may be related to compensation mechanisms, automation bias, and blind reliance. This study systematically analyzed the comorbidities of mental symptoms among pilots and their complex relationship with safety operation behaviors. The findings provide practical insights for airline management to promote pilots’ mental health and enhance aviation safety protocols. Additionally, the study contributes to aviation psychology and safety research by offering evidence-based recommendations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2026.</abstract>"
2025,"Korea, Republic of","Building Sustainable Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Hospitality: Structural Relationships of Rapport, Trust, and Psychological Capital Among Airline Cabin Crew","<title>Building Sustainable Organizational Citizenship Behavior in Hospitality: Structural Relationships of Rapport, Trust, and Psychological Capital Among Airline Cabin Crew</title> <abstract>This study examines the structural relationships among rapport, trust, psychological capital (PsyCap), and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) in the emotionally demanding work context of airline cabin crews. Grounded in the job demands–resources (JD-R) model and social exchange theory (SET), we propose and test a sequential mediation model in which rapport is positively associated with trust, trust is positively associated with PsyCap, and PsyCap is positively associated with OCB. Based on survey data from 248 South Korean flight attendants, structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrates that rapport is indirectly associated with OCB through the sequential mediation of trust and PsyCap, rather than displaying a significant direct association. The findings indicate that rapport functions not merely as an immediate behavioral driver but as a relational asset that is linked to the psychological capacities essential for sustainable organizational behavior. This study contributes to the theory by integrating JD-R and SET perspectives to explain how relational and psychological resources are jointly related to OCB. While the primary focus was on mediation, future research should test potential moderation effects, such as how job demands or emotional labor may shape the strength of these pathways—aligning with the JD-R model’s interactive assumptions. Practically, the results suggest that airline organizations and other service industries can promote sustainable human resource management by cultivating trust-based relational capital and strengthening employees’ PsyCap through targeted training, mentoring, and supportive leadership practices. These insights extend beyond aviation to other service sectors characterized by high emotional labor demands, offering a pathway to strengthen human resource sustainability and organizational social sustainability. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"
2025,China,Evidence-based fitness-to-fly assessment for military aviators with untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysms: A 5-year retrospective at a single center,"<title>Evidence-based fitness-to-fly assessment for military aviators with untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysms: A 5-year retrospective at a single center</title> <abstract>The increasing detection of untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in military aviators poses a challenge for aeromedical clearance. This study aimed to introduce the fitness-to-fly criteria for military aviators with UIAs in our center and try to develop evidence-based aeromedical guidelines. We retrospectively reviewed active-duty military aviators diagnosed as UIAs by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in a single center between 2019 and 2024. A multidisciplinary team performed comprehensive rupture risk stratification to determine patients for intervention. Afterwards, a dedicated aeromedical review board evaluated in-flight incapacitation risk and flight eligibility in the non-intervention group. Clinical features, aneurysm characteristics (size, location, morphology) and the final aeromedical disposition of these untreated cases were reported and analyzed. Twenty-three active-duty military aviators were diagnosed with UIAs by DSA at our institution over a 5-year period. Seven patients underwent intervention, whereas 16 were placed under conservative surveillance. All conservatively managed cases involved male aviators (mean age: 36 years) with small (< 5 mm), saccular UIAs, primarily in the paraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) segments (68.8%). None had hypertension or smoking history. The estimated annual rupture risk was < 0.5% for small paraclinoid aneurysms and nearly 0% for cavernous ICA aneurysms. Therefore, flight clearance was granted with operational restrictions for 11 pilots with small paraclinoid aneurysms (dual-seat or captaincy duties), while 5 with cavernous ICA aneurysms received unrestricted certification. Annual case-by-case inspections, along with MRA surveillance and psychological support, are required. This study represents one of the largest real-world practice of aeromedical certification for untreated UIAs. The annual rupture risk is extremely low (< 0.5%) for small saccular aneurysms located at the medial wall of the paraclinoid segment and nearly negligible for those in the cavernous segment of the ICA. Granting flight qualification to military personnel with such aneurysms is medically appropriate, provided enhanced surveillance protocols are implemented. Our protocol maximizes retention of experienced aircrew while ensuring operational safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>"
2025,Sao Tome and Principe - United States,Estimating hypoxia-induced brain dysfunction and cognitive decline through exhaled breath monitoring,"<title>Estimating hypoxia-induced brain dysfunction and cognitive decline through exhaled breath monitoring</title> <abstract>Background: Hypoxia remains a concern for aircrew operating high performance aircraft. Sensing and mitigating hypoxia is a line of active research within the US Air Force and US Navy. It is hypothesized that changes in exhaled breath volatile organic compound content could indicate, not only changes in oxygen saturation (SpO<inf>2</inf>), but also brain activity and cognitive function. Methods: On-line exhaled breath monitoring via proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry was used to observe changes in volatile organic compound concentrations during mask-free hypoxic exposures. Additionally, electroencephalography measurements in response to an odd-ball paradigm and cognitive tasks were collected throughout the exposures. Results: The data show hypoxic exposures induced a physiological response including a significant reduction in SpO<inf>2</inf>, a decrease in the electroencephalography waveform peak-to-peak amplitude (p < 0.05), a significant increase in psychomotor vigilance test response time, and an increase in perceived symptomatology. Exhaled breath results indicate 19 volatile organic compound features are significantly different between hypoxia and normoxia (p < 0.05) with 13 showing an increase in exhaled breath compared to background measurements (p < 0.05). Linear mixed modeling with stepwise reduction demonstrates 7 of the features are significantly indicative of changes in SpO<inf>2</inf> with 3 and 4 features indicative of changes in brain wave functions and psychomotor vigilance test response times, respectively. Conclusions: The data establish, for the first time, differences in exhaled breath volatile concentrations that indicate changes in cognition derived from hypoxic insult. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2025.</abstract>"
2025,China,Construction of leadership competency model for civil aviation flight cadets: An empirical study from China,"<title>Construction of leadership competency model for civil aviation flight cadets: An empirical study from China</title> <abstract>Human factors are often linked to unsafe events in civil aviation transport, with the competency level and decision-making abilities of flight crews playing a significant role. The leadership and teamwork competency of the flight crew in the cockpit directly influences the occurrence of aviation safety incidents. Leadership is a developmental and trainable skill. This study aims to explore the key components of leadership and the competency model for civil aviation flight cadets. Based on classic leadership theories and leadership development theories, the research adopts a qualitative analysis using grounded theory and utilizes Nvivo 11.0 software for data analysis. An initial leadership evaluation index system for flight cadets was developed. Through a survey of 319 civil aviation pilots and using SPSS 26.0 software for data processing, an evaluation index system was established, covering 4 dimensions—core values, leader competency, outstanding thinking, and positive behavior—with 22 indicators. The study also applied AMOS 24.0 software to conduct validation factor analysis and path analysis and construct the BLVT model of leadership development for civil aviation flight cadets. The findings indicate that, within the 4 dimensions of leadership and the BLVT model, core values influence positive behavior through leader competency and outstanding thinking, resulting in appropriate performance by flight cadets. Outstanding thinking directly affects leader competency, thereby driving the leadership development of flight cadets, who form the development of their leadership skills by recognizing their leadership competencies. The results of this study clarify the 4 key elements of leadership composition and development for civil aviation flight cadets, providing valuable insights into leadership training and development. This study significantly contributes to bridging the gap in civil aviation pilot leadership training and offers a clear pathway for enhancing pilot leadership. © The Author(s) 2025.</abstract>"
2025,United States,Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling for Physiological Data in Small-N Aviation Human Factors Research,"<title>Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling for Physiological Data in Small-N Aviation Human Factors Research</title> <abstract>Monitoring pilot cognitive state in real time is becoming increasingly important as automation plays a larger role in aviation. Traditional workload assessments, such as questionnaires or task-based performance metrics, provide useful insights but can be limited in rapidly changing flight environments. Physiological measures, including heart rate, respiration, and electroencephalogram (EEG), offer continuous data streams, yet their variability and complexity present challenges for analysis. This study explores the use of a hierarchical Bayesian framework to quantify patterns from physiological signals recorded during high-fidelity flight simulations. Five certified pilots flew scenarios that varied in automation level and working memory demand while heart rate, respiration rate, and EEG-derived workload estimates were monitored. The model generated individualized and condition-specific estimates, quantified uncertainty, and remained stable with a small participant pool. Heart rate appeared to be the most consistent indicator, followed by EEG-derived workload, while respiration rate was less reliable across conditions. These results suggest that Bayesian inference may provide a promising way to interpret physiological data in aviation settings and could support the development of adaptive automation that responds to pilot workload. The approach emphasizes transparency and efficiency, offering complementary value to existing modeling techniques for aerospace human factors and flight deck applications. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"
2025,,Optimizing Muscle Activation in Cadets Using Electromyography Biofeedback During Anti-G Training,"<title>Optimizing Muscle Activation in Cadets Using Electromyography Biofeedback During Anti-G Training</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Effective execution of the anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) is essential for pilots to maintain consciousness under high gravitational forces (+Gz). This study evaluated whether electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback enhances muscle activation patterns during AGSM training in novice cadets. METHODS: There were 58 Brazilian Air Force cadets (age: 25 ± 1 yr) who performed two AGSM sessions involving sustained submaximal isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, and rectus abdominis muscles, synchronized with rhythmic breathing every 3 s. Subjects completed trials under counterbalanced visual EMG feedback conditions (real-time visualization vs. no visualization) and were randomly assigned to verbal feedback conditions (instructor guidance vs. no guidance). EMG signals were recorded at 1500 Hz and normalized to each subject's peak amplitude during the AGSM trials. RESULTS: Muscle-specific responses to feedback were observed. Verbal feedback enhanced gastrocnemius activation but reduced vastus medialis activation. Combined visual and verbal feedback produced the highest activation in the rectus abdominis. Visual feedback alone had minimal effect across all muscles. Despite submaximal instructions, brief peak activations were sufficient for normalization. DISCUSSION: EMG biofeedback facilitated motor learning of AGSM by selectively improving activation in targeted muscles. However, effects varied by muscle group, suggesting the need for tailored instructional strategies. Although task-based normalization offers ecological validity, it may limit comparisons with MVC-based protocols. Incorporating EMG biofeedback may enhance AGSM training, particularly in novice populations or settings without centrifuge access. Massaferri R, Calvo APC, Coutinho ABB, Guimarães TT, Farinatti P.

2025,,Spatial Disorientation Event During Flight Due to Proposed Reverse-Dip Visual Illusion,"<title>Spatial Disorientation Event During Flight Due to Proposed Reverse-Dip Visual Illusion</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Spatial disorientation is a leading nontechnical cause of fatal military aviation accidents, triggered by insufficient or misleading cues mainly from the visual and vestibular systems. Spatial disorientation accounts for 20-38% of fatal military aviation accidents, but case reports describing specific illusions during actual flight are rare. CASE REPORT: On a clear night, an aerial refueling tanker was cruising at 16,000 ft (4877 m), while an F-15I fighter aircraft was 3 mi behind and 971 ft (296 m) below. About 100 s before a near collision, the fighter pilot switched to Air-to-Air mode, displaying the distance and speed difference to the tanker via a Target Designator box on the Head-Up Display. However, the crew did not realize they were accelerating toward the tanker [from 597-663 ft · s-1 (182-202 m · s-1)] or climbing by 738 ft (225 m). The two aircraft came within 49 ft (15 m) of each other before the navigator noticed the tanker and initiated a roll to the left. DISCUSSION: The dip illusion occurs when a pilot flying in trail attempts to maintain the image of the lead aircraft in a fixed position on the windscreen as separation increases, which can lead to unintentional descent. In this case, we propose a ""reverse-dip"" illusion. The fighter crew was unaware they were closing in on the tanker, causing the Target Designator box to rise in the Head-Up Display. The pilot instinctively pulled back on the stick to maintain the box's position, resulting in an unintentional climb. Recognizing how such illusions develop in flight is essential to reducing future risks. Nakdimon I, Gordon B. Spatial disorientation event during flight due to proposed reverse-dip visual illusion.

2025,United States,Development and Validation of the Military Readiness Scale in U.S. Naval Aircrew,"<title>Development and Validation of the Military Readiness Scale in U.S. Naval Aircrew</title> <abstract>Introduction Readiness is a ubiquitous term in DoD doctrine and has been broadly defined as the ability of military forces to meet the demands of assigned missions. There is currently no criterion standard of military readiness and there is also a lack of published readiness measures for the individual military service member, the fundamental building block of force readiness. This report describes the development and validation of the Military Readiness Scale-15 (MRS-15), a self-report instrument, in U.S. Naval Aircrew. Materials and Methods Scale items were developed by human performance scientists, including a psychometrician. The team developed 19 candidate items, which were administered to Naval Aircrew personnel (N = 164), along with validated measures of theoretically relevant constructs (e.g., pain). Factor structure of the scale was explored with principal components factoring, and Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization. Removal of 4 items yielded a highly consistent, 15-item scale. From the final scale, we derived a Total Military Readiness score with three readiness subscales that we termed General-Psychological, Technical, and Physical. Results We observed robust, age-adjusted relationships in the expected directions, between the Total Military Readiness score and bodily pain, fatigue, occupational stress, mental health symptoms, and sleep disruption. Conclusions The MRS-15 is a preliminarily valid and reliable self-report instrument that holds promise for evaluating perceived readiness. To this end, we conceptualized a ""readiness dashboard""prototype that is informed by MRS-15 data and can be integrated with a representative selection of other measures to display the readiness status of an individual or an entire unit. Altogether, this research can help to inform policy, training, and resourcing efforts to prepare Naval Aircrew for future engagements. © 2025 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

2025,France - Netherlands,Assessment of individual and dyadic workload of student and instructor pilots in real and simulated flight: An exploratory study,"<title>Assessment of individual and dyadic workload of student and instructor pilots in real and simulated flight: An exploratory study</title> <abstract>Flight instructors are vital in the training of novice pilots. Just as the mental workload in student pilots fluctuates during training, so does the mental workload of the instructors, affecting their dyadic performance and judgment. This paper explored how training environments (simulated vs. real flight), flight control conditions (student pilot flying vs. monitoring), and flight phases (take-off vs. downwind vs. landing) could affect mental workload in student and instructor pilots, as well as their interpersonal coordination through electrocardiography (ECG) based measures. Student pilots performed four consecutive standard flight traffic patterns with an instructor in a simulator and in real flight, under different flight control conditions of varying workload demands, while their ECG signals were recorded. The results indicated different patterns of interpersonal coordination between simulated and real flight. The other experimental variables, i.e., flight control and flight phase, mostly had an effect on participants’ heart rate and heart rate variability. In accordance with the existing literature, heart rate increased in high workload conditions and flight phases, whilst heart rate variability decreased. Additionally, we observed a linear relationship between subjective workload and physiological synchrony which indicates that student-instructor coordination increased as the student pilot experienced more mental workload in the flight tasks. The current study highlights that individual workload as well as dyadic workload, measured through cardiac signals, can be used to evaluate student-instructor coordination during flight training as an indicator of training outcomes. © 2025 The Authors</abstract>"
2025,United States,Flight-associated cortisol dynamics and subjective assessments of pain and stress in fighter pilots: an exploratory study,"<title>Flight-associated cortisol dynamics and subjective assessments of pain and stress in fighter pilots: an exploratory study</title> <abstract>Purpose: Operating a high-performance fifth-generation fighter jet is a potential stressor in which hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dynamics may reflect the intensity of and adaptation to the stressor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate HPA axis activity in fighter pilots and explore whether indices of activity correlated with subjective indices of stress. Methods: We studied HPA axis dynamics in 20 experienced fifth-generation fighter pilots (18 men/2 women) by measuring salivary cortisol at various times from bedtime the night before a flight training to awakening the morning after the flight training. We also measured plasma ACTH and serum cortisol the day before the flight and immediately following the flight. These findings were correlated with prior pilot flight experience and subjective assessments of pain and stress. Results: Seven (35%) of the pilots demonstrated normal salivary cortisol levels at all time points despite one having a high index of pain. Lower pre-flight salivary cortisol was correlated with more flight hours in the year leading up to the flight exercise. Flight day awakening salivary cortisol was inversely correlated with pilot-reported post-flight stress. In general, there were no other major correlations suggesting a disconnect between an objective measure of stress via HPA axis dynamics and subjective indices of stress and pain. Conclusion: The acute HPA axis response in some experienced fighter pilots habituates to the stressor of flying a fighter jet during a training exercise. The experience of the pilot was a determinant of their HPA axis stress response. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>"
2025,Italy - Pakistan,The Moderating Role of Resilience in the Relationship Between Occupational Stressors and Psychological Distress Among Aviation Pilots in Pakistan,"<title>The Moderating Role of Resilience in the Relationship Between Occupational Stressors and Psychological Distress Among Aviation Pilots in Pakistan</title> <abstract>Background: Aviation is one of the most demanding professions, exposing pilots to persistent stressors such as fatigue, irregular schedules, and high safety responsibility. These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots. Method: A sample of 200 pilots completed validated self-report measures: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro. Results: Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = −0.46, p < 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p < 0.01. Conclusions: Resilience emerged as both a direct and indirect buffer against psychological strain in aviation. These findings underscore the importance of promoting adaptive coping and resilience training, alongside effective fatigue management, to enhance pilot well-being and maintain safety in aviation systems. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"
2025,,Post-COVID-19 Neurocognitive Screening in Routine Pilot Aeromedical Evaluations,"<title>Post-COVID-19 Neurocognitive Screening in Routine Pilot Aeromedical Evaluations</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: One crucial aspect of flight safety is being able to detect medical or neuropsychological conditions during aeromedical examinations. However, subtle but safety-significant post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments may go unreported or undetected. The Trail Making Test (TMT) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) can detect these impairments in domains essential to pilot performance, though further investigation is needed to assess their effectiveness and clinical utility in routine pilot aeromedical examinations. This short communication presents preliminary findings for using these tests. METHODS: A study identified the TMT and SDMT as appropriate screening tools for evaluating pilot neurocognitive performance after COVID-19. Mixed methods were then used to compare the screening tools' performance between post-COVID-19 cases and healthy controls, while also assessing their acceptability and feasibility in routine aeromedical examinations for pilots. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 neurocognitive disorders affect skills that are essential for pilot performance. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tests, with area under the curve values of 0.853 for TMT Part B, 0.817 for the SDC version of SDMT, and 0.769 for TMT Part A, indicating their effectiveness in identifying cognitive impairments. Airline pilots considered screening an important flight safety intervention. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots, together with international aviation psychologists and aviation medicine experts, endorsed the safety-critical importance and value of screening pilots for post-COVID-19 impairments. Given the numerous practical implications of implementing such a strategy, we recommend that pilots be screened for potential post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairments. A larger study is necessary to validate these preliminary findings and recommendations. Beka SG, Griffiths RF, Myers JA, Skirrow PM.

2025,,"Medical Reporting Behavior of Military, Commercial, and General Aviation Pilots","<title>Medical Reporting Behavior of Military, Commercial, and General Aviation Pilots</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pilots are undoubtedly among employees who undergo rigorous medical evaluations to ensure they are fit to fly. However, accidents like the Germanwings Flight 9525 highlight that medically unfit individuals can still end up in the cockpit. METHODS: This study sought to investigate Greek pilots' attitudes toward medical reporting, given that the available national research is very limited. Semistructured interviews were conducted and analyzed through Thematic Analysis with subjects (N = 18) from general, military, and commercial aviation in Greece during the first quarter of 2024. Cross-sectoral differences were identified through Content Analysis. RESULTS: The primary barrier to medical reporting, identified by 16 out of 18 subjects (88% of the sample), was the fear of losing their pilot license, which would have major consequences for their income and way of life. Additionally, concerns about the perceived damage to professional identity and a deep passion for flying contributed to their reluctance to disclose medical issues. A general tendency to conceal medical problems from the Aeromedical Examiner during the annual medical certificate renewal was identified, particularly when such issues were considered of minor importance (61% of the sample). DISCUSSION: Although the findings align with international research, this study identified a more pronounced tendency among subjects to conceal medical issues they perceived as unimportant. The establishment of compulsory loss-of-pilot-license insurance was the major mitigation measure proposed by the interviewees. Nonetheless, its effectiveness remains questionable according to the literature, and further research is recommended in this area. Kioulepoglou P, Makris I.

2025,Netherlands - United Kingdom,Quantifying the Impact of Spatial Disorientation on Pilot Mental Workload and Attentional Focus,"<title>Quantifying the Impact of Spatial Disorientation on Pilot Mental Workload and Attentional Focus</title> <abstract>Objective: We aimed to find objective measures of the impact of spatially disorienting (SD) stimuli on pilot cognition in an ecologically valid environment. Background: SD frequently occurs in military rotary-wing operations and often contributes to mishaps. Effects of SD stimuli on pilots are usually quantified using control errors, but effects on cognition have not yet been successfully quantified. Method: Military helicopter pilots (n = 14) performed scenarios with six SD stimuli (SD condition) and six corresponding control stimuli (NoSD condition) in a motion-base simulator with integrated virtual reality headset. SD stimuli were: false horizon, featureless terrain, leans, brownout, a somatogyral yaw illusion, and loss of horizon due to night vision goggles (NVGs). Mental workload was measured using auditory arithmetic task performance and attentional focus was measured using eye-tracking. Results: Average arithmetic task performance was significantly impaired, and proportional gaze dwell time on the attitude indicator was significantly increased in the SD compared to the NoSD condition. Of the six SD stimuli, the featureless terrain, the leans, and the brownout induced significant effects on performance, whereas the featureless terrain, brownout, and false horizon significantly affected gaze behavior. The NVGs and somatogyral yaw stimuli did not induce significant effects. Pilots’ self-reports indicated awareness of all SD stimuli, except for the featureless terrain. Conclusion: The results indicate that SD impacts pilot mental workload and attentional focus. Application: Modern military aircraft present a large volume of mission-related information to pilots. This study shows that SD stimuli may negatively impact the processing of such information. © 2025 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Methods A total of 134 civil aviation aircrews with cardiovascular diseases detected during annual physical examinations at the Aviation Health Center of China Southern Airlines Co., Ltd. in 2023 were selected. Psychological evaluation was conducted using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression screening and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety screening. The results of psychological assessments were compared across civil aviation aircrews with cardiovascular diseases and of different types. Multiple Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors to psycho-cardiological diseases. Results Among the 134 aircrews with cardiovascular diseases, 30 were found to suffer from depression, 71 from anxiety, and 9 from both. The detection rate of psycho-cardiological diseases was 68.66% (92/134) and significantly different between crews who were different in age (P=0.013), flying hours (χ2=9.68, P=0.035), jobs (χ2=16.33, P=0.008), and exercise habits (χ2=11.35, P=0.042). No significant differences were observed in detection rates between genders or between those with a family history of disease and those without (both P>0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that ages 40-49 (compared to ages <30, OR=2.450, 95%CI: 1.324-4.563), flying hours of 10 000-20 000 h (compared to <5 000 h, OR=2.865, 95%CI: 1.452-5.683), pilots (compared to flight attendants, OR=3.123, 95%CI: 1.671-5.832), and inactivity (compared to regular physical activity, OR=2.156, 95%CI: 1.179-3.924) were risk factors for psycho-cardiological diseases. Conclusions The detection rate of psycho-cardiological diseases is notably high among civil aviation aircrews, with a number of risk factors. 2025, Chinese Medical Association</abstract>"
2025,"Korea, Republic of",Non-native English Communication and Anxiety in Military ATC: Insights from Korean Air Traffic Controllers,"<title>Non-native English Communication and Anxiety in Military ATC: Insights from Korean Air Traffic Controllers</title> <abstract>This mixed-methods study investigated language anxiety among Korean military air traffic controllers (ATCOs) when communicating with native English-speaking pilots. The quantitative phase (N = 81) used hierarchical regression analysis examining relationships between individual characteristics and anxiety levels. The qualitative phase (N = 13) employed semi-structured interviews exploring controllers' experiences, anxiety triggers, and coping mechanisms. Results revealed that general communication anxiety (β = .69, p < .001) and English proficiency (β = -.28, p < .05) significantly predicted anxiety with American pilots, with psychological factors explaining 58.8% of variance. These findings suggest that language anxiety stems from broader communication apprehension rather than isolated linguistic difficulties. Qualitative analysis identified five themes: communication breakdown, technical factors, skills hierarchy, informal coping, and institutional gaps. Overall, the study indicates that language anxiety in military ATC contexts is complex, influenced by individual psychological traits, situational demands, and organizational factors. It contributes to a deeper understanding of professional language anxiety in safety-critical contexts and provides evidence-based recommendations for aviation English training reform. © 2025 The Korea Association of Teachers of English (KATE).

2025,"Korea, Republic of",Effects of Flight Attendants' Mental Health Resulting From Emotion Regulation Among Coworkers on Flight Safety Attitudes: Moderating Effects of Behavioral Activation Systems,"<title>Effects of Flight Attendants' Mental Health Resulting From Emotion Regulation Among Coworkers on Flight Safety Attitudes: Moderating Effects of Behavioral Activation Systems</title> <abstract>We developed a causal conceptual framework from a social-psychological perspective to investigate whether cabin crews' mental health affects flight safety attitudes via emotion regulation toward coworkers. In addition, the moderating effect of behavioral activation systems (BAS) in linking emotion regulation to mental health is examined. Data were collected through a quantitative survey administered both online and face to face at major airports in Korea over 2 months (January–March 2025). A total of 249 valid responses from airline cabin crews were analyzed using SPSS 21 and AMOS 20. The results reveal that deep acting and relation-involved ambivalence positively influence mental health, whereas self-defensive ambivalence and surface acting negatively affect it. Mental health is also found to enhance flight safety attitudes, and the moderating effects of BAS are supported, except for SDA. This study demonstrates that flight safety attitudes are shaped by social psychological factors and also offers managerial implications. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>"
2025,Greece,Assessment of Occupational Health and Safety Performance in Air Traffic Control: An Empirical Investigation of Stress and Well-Being,"<title>Assessment of Occupational Health and Safety Performance in Air Traffic Control: An Empirical Investigation of Stress and Well-Being</title> <abstract>Air traffic control is widely recognized as one of the most psychologically demanding occupations, where safety and operational performance are tightly interwoven. This study explores the relationship between occupational health and safety (OHS) systems and the psychological well-being of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs), focusing on factors such as perceived safety, job satisfaction, stress, and mental strain. Conducted within the Hellenic Air Navigation Services Provider, the research adopts a cross-sectional design using a structured questionnaire distributed nationwide. The study draws upon the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) theoretical framework to examine how organizational resources, such as training, clarity of role, supervisor support, and employee autonomy, interact with job demands to shape occupational outcomes. Special emphasis is placed on understanding how the presence and awareness of structured OHS systems influence ATCOs’ perceptions of safety and well-being. Our analysis indicated that participants who reported the presence of an OHS system perceived their workplace as significantly safer than those who reported no such system. Hence, the existence of structured measures allows ATCOs to feel confident in their work environment. By assessing a range of psychosocial and organizational variables, this study seeks to contribute to both the academic discourse and practical strategies aimed at improving safety culture and psychological resilience in high-risk work environments. The findings are intended to inform policy development and organizational practices within the air traffic control sector and other safety-critical domains. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"
2025,United States,Evaluating the Impact of a Spine Training Program on Air Force Student Fighter Pilots,"<title>Evaluating the Impact of a Spine Training Program on Air Force Student Fighter Pilots</title> <abstract>Introduction: A 2022 survey conducted by Headquarters Air Combat Command Aircrew Performance Branch found that 98% of fighter aircrew reported flight-related neck pain during their career. Despite the high prevalence of neck pain and growing operational demands, there remains no consensus regarding best practices for mitigating aircrew pain and injury. Although most pilot training locations have established aircrew performance teams, only select locations have mandated training hours to support injury mitigation training. Eglin Air Force Base (EAFB) F-35A student pilots (SPs) engage in a mandatory 8-week standardized spine training program (STP). In contrast, the F-15E Flying Course at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (SJAFB) does not have syllabus hours to support the STP, resulting in the capability to utilize this site as a comparison group for this analysis. The primary objective of this study was to determine if completion of the STP led to significant differences in the Cervical Endurance Hold (CEH). We hypothesized that SPs would exhibit significant training adaptations only if they had dedicated training hours that could support the completion of the STP. Materials and Methods: SPs from EAFB who were actively enrolled in the F-35A Flying Course from 2022 to 2024 participated in an 8-week STP. The CEH test was administered before the start of the Flying Course (pre-flying training), after the 8-week STP intervention (post-8 week), after the air-to-air phase of training (post air-to-air), and after the completion of the Flying Course (post-flying training). SPs from SJAFB who were actively enrolled in the F-15E Flying Course from 2022 to 2024 did not participate in the standardized STP. The CEH test was administered before the Flying Course (pre-flying training) and following the completion of the Flying Course (post-flying training). JMP 16.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) was used to retrospectively analyze the data from this study. Results: There was a significant effect from the STP between the intervention (EAFB) and comparison (SJAFB) groups (F(1,81.28) = 7.456; P = .008). Additionally, the STP had a significantly positive effect on CEH time, following the initial 8-week intervention (pre-training = 96.28s ± (37.95s), 8-week = 132.81 seconds ± (30.96s) P < .001), which was maintained throughout the duration of the Flying Course (pre-training = 96.28s ± (37.95s), post-training = 117.34s ± (29.73s) P = .013). Conclusions: The study results show a significant improvement in CEH outcomes after the 8-week STP intervention, which was not seen at the comparison site. Notably, the benefits of the STP at the intervention site were sustained even after the Flying Course was completed, indicating that the program may have a sustained protective effect. Future analysis of flight profiles between locations that implement the STP and those that do not should be conducted. This comparison could help determine whether the STP is contributing to a reduction in duty limitations. Furthermore, if a relationship exists, these findings may provide valuable insights for experts seeking the most effective spine training methods to mitigate pain, injury, and attrition in fighter aircrew. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2025.</abstract>"
2025,,"Cognitive Engagement Profiling of Pilots in High-Speed, High-Threat Scenarios","<title>Cognitive Engagement Profiling of Pilots in High-Speed, High-Threat Scenarios</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: This study investigated pilot cognitive engagement patterns across diverse flight conditions using electroencephalography (EEG)-based measurements in a high-fidelity rotary-wing simulation environment. METHODS: A total of 8 experienced U.S. Army test pilots completed 24 flights across 3 distinct route designs using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Vertical Motion Simulator, with airspeeds ranging from 120 to 240 kn. Analysis focused on EEG Beta/(Alpha + Theta) ratios as indicators of changing cognitive engagement over time. RESULTS: Analyses revealed distinct cognitive engagement patterns across routes: highly variable individual responses in routes with changing navigation demands, more consistent cognitive engagement in systematic route designs, and intermediate variability in mixed-demand routes. Airspeed effects on cognitive engagement became particularly pronounced above 200 kn, though these effects varied significantly by route and individual pilot. Temporal analysis demonstrated evolving patterns of cognitive adaptation, with routes eliciting different progression patterns over extended flight periods. Regression analysis showed that EEG Beta/(Alpha+Theta) values increased significantly during all three routes, with mean increases ranging from 0.0051-0.0146. DISCUSSION: These findings provide quantifiable metrics for optimizing route design, developing personalized training approaches, and implementing real-time monitoring systems for enhanced aviation safety and performance.

2025,,Initial Psychometric Validation of a Self-Report Measure of the Symptoms of Mild Hypoxic Hypoxia,"<title>Initial Psychometric Validation of a Self-Report Measure of the Symptoms of Mild Hypoxic Hypoxia</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: There has been long-standing interest in the physiological and psychological effects of mild hypoxia on aircrew, but to date there is no psychometrically valid self-report measure of subjective symptoms. METHODS: To address this gap, we developed a self-report scale along three dimensions of impairment: cognitive, sensory and affective. We administered this scale to active and retired aircrew (N = 354) with on average 25.04 yr (SD = 11.27) of military service and subjected their responses to exploratory factor analysis using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, followed by reliability analysis to determine cohesiveness of associated items. RESULTS: We provide initial psychometric validation for our 12-item scale's three-dimensional structure. The internal consistency reliability of the cognitive, sensory, and affective factors was 0.90, 0.75, and 0.85, respectively. DISCUSSION: Going forward, the consistent use of this instrument will likely reduce the methodological variability in measuring the symptoms of mild hypoxia in the literature.

2025,Australia,A duty to enhance? Genetic engineering for the human Mars settlement,"<title>A duty to enhance? Genetic engineering for the human Mars settlement</title> <abstract>Humans living off-world will face numerous physical, psychological and social challenges and are likely to suffer negative health effects due to their lack of evolutionary adaptation to space environments. While some of the necessary adaptations may develop naturally over many generations, genetic technologies could be used to speed this process along, potentially improving the wellbeing of early space settlers and their offspring. With broad support, such a program could lead to significant genetic modification of off-world communities, for example, to limit radiation damage on body systems or prevent bone and muscle loss in reduced gravity conditions. Given the extreme stressors of living off-world, and the need to have a healthy workforce to support a fledgling human settlement, those in favour of using genetic technologies to enhance settlers might even claim there is a moral imperative to protect their health in the face of the unique threats of space travel, especially for children born in settlements who did not take on these risks voluntarily. For some, this might simply be an extension of procreative beneficence. However, ethical concerns arise regarding the risks of embracing a eugenicist agenda and the potential impacts on the rights of future settlers to refuse such genetic enhancements for themselves or their children. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Monash University 2024.</abstract>"
2025,China - Hong Kong - Sweden,Development and validation of a prediction model for the depressive symptom risk in commercial airline pilots,"<title>Development and validation of a prediction model for the depressive symptom risk in commercial airline pilots</title> <abstract>Background/aims: Shift workers, such as medical personnel, and pilots, are facing an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms significantly impact an individual’s quality of life and affect work performance, decision-making abilities, and overall public safety. This study aims to establish a multidimensional depressive symptom prediction model based on a large sample of commercial airline pilots to facilitate early identification, prevention, and personalized intervention strategies. Methods: This population-based study included 11,111 participants, with 7918 pilots in the training set and 3193 pilots in the external validation set. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Physiological, psychological, and lifestyle factors potentially associated with depressive symptom risk were collected. The optimal predictors for model development were selected using the Boruta algorithm combined with the LASSO method, and a nomogram was developed using multivariate logistic regression to predict depressive symptoms in pilots. The model performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and accuracy measures, such as the Brier score and Spiegelhalter z-test. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to assess the model's clinical utility. Results: A total of 7918 pilots were included in the training set and 3193 were included in the external validation set. Five characteristic indicators were selected based on their significance in the prediction of depressive symptom risk: living status, alcohol drinking, family history of mental health disorder, subjective health, and subjective sleep quality. The model showed acceptable overall discrimination (AUC<inf>train</inf> = 0.836, 95%CI 0.818 to 0.854; AUC<inf>validation</inf> = 0.840, 95%CI 0.811 to 0.868) and calibration (Brier score<inf>train</inf> = 0.048; Brier score<inf>validation</inf> = 0.051). The decision curve analysis showed that the net benefit was superior to intervening on all participants or not intervening on all participants. Conclusions: This study provides a reliable tool for early prediction and customized management of depressive symptoms among commercial airline pilots. This approach promotes the development of the field by transitioning from passive mental health care to active mental health prevention, emphasizing personalized prevention strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2025.</abstract>"
2025,"Korea, Republic of",Development and validation of spatial disorientation scenarios using virtual reality and motion simulator,"<title>Development and validation of spatial disorientation scenarios using virtual reality and motion simulator</title> <abstract>Spatial Disorientation (SD) can cause critical aviation accidents by adversely affecting the pilot's ability to perform a flight mission. One of the strategies to improve pilots' ability to deal with SD is to perform SD training using Virtual Reality and Motion Simulator (VRMS) system. However, there is still a lack of studies that investigated the application of VRMS for SD training. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop and validate VRMS-based SD scenarios. Twenty-two male Air Force fighter pilots (11 in the low experienced group and 11 in the high experienced group) participated in a controlled experiment in which they performed the flight task under two conditions (SD flight, non-SD flight), wherein the SD flight condition included the induction of four distinct SD illusions. Findings showed that the developed SD scenarios in the VRMS system effectively induce SD. More specifically, there were differences in the influence of flight experience and SD condition on pilots' flight performance and workload. This study suggests that the VRMS system can demonstrate several types of SD scenarios effectively and has a huge potential to be utilized as an SD training tool to improve overall flight safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2025,France,Impact of automation level on airline pilots’ flying performance and visual scanning strategies: A full flight simulator study,"<title>Impact of automation level on airline pilots’ flying performance and visual scanning strategies: A full flight simulator study</title> <abstract>Cockpit automation has brought significant benefits in terms of mental workload and fatigue. However, the way primary flight instruments are monitored by pilots may be negatively affected by the high confidence in systems. We examined the effects of automation level on mental workload, manual flight performance and visual strategies. Twenty professional pilots performed six landing scenarios at three levels of automation depending on flight director (flight path guidance) and autothrust (automatic management of the speed) engagements. Higher levels of automation increased flight performance and reduced mental workload, but were associated with a decrease in vigilance to primary instruments, particularly flight path indicators and engines’ thrust. We also found that gaze entropy was sensitive to pilot role (pilot flying vs pilot monitoring) and automation level. These results confirmed the risks of adverse effects of automation on visual monitoring. Designing procedures for pilots to actively monitor automated cockpit systems should be encouraged. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>"
2025,"China - India - Malaysia - Saudi Arabia - Taiwan, Province of China",Intelligent traffic management via personalized group consensus based on chimp optimization-guided random vector functional link and quantum theory: A perspective of randomization,"<title>Intelligent traffic management via personalized group consensus based on chimp optimization-guided random vector functional link and quantum theory: A perspective of randomization</title> <abstract>In urban traffic management, bike-sharing systems are crucial for green transportation. However, due to the uneven distribution of shared bikes and randomization of user behavior, the urban dockless bicycle sharing system (UDBSS) faces issues of randomization. Since rebalancing in UDBSS involves the opinion and preference of multiple stakeholders, it can be modeled as a group consensus problem. Nevertheless, mutual influence among users, changing preferences, and psychological inconsistencies, along with the absence of personalized strategies in traditional methods, adversely affect demand decisions for UDBSS. To address this issue, this paper innovatively combines random vector functional link (RVFL) networks, quantum theory (QT), and prospect–regret theory (P–RT), to construct a personalized two-stage group consensus framework. First, with the support of three-way decisions, an improved K-means++ algorithm based on Euclidean distances and Hausdorff distances is used for clustering, which reduces the uncertainty in the UDBSS problem. Additionally, to address the randomization issue, RVFL is used to calculate intragroup user weights, and the chimp optimization algorithm (CHOA) is applied for the hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, considering users’ psychological behavior, a two-stage consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed, and a personalized adjustment mechanism based on QT, P–RT, and hesitation degrees is proposed. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a shared bicycle deployment scenario, with experimental analysis using data from the Citi Bike system and survey data to verify its effectiveness and feasibility. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2025,China - Thailand,Understanding the airborne experiences of passengers with depression in long-haul air travels,"<title>Understanding the airborne experiences of passengers with depression in long-haul air travels</title> <abstract>This qualitative study scrutinises the role of depression in mediating air travellers' in-flight experiences. Depression can turn a travelling body into a docile object subject to others’ judgment. As a consequence, the vulnerable body may become less connected with its surroundings. Nevertheless, atmospheres are everywhere. Thus, depressed bodies may receive the atmospheric influence in aircraft cabins. This is not a comfortable experience. The depressed bodies are thus found to actively retreat from the atmospheres by appropriating an assemblage of habit, skills, movement and materials. By conceptualising this dynamic tension (between receiving and preventing atmospheric effects), this study makes a theoretical contribution to expand atmospheric studies and the psychologic and psychiatric literature on depressive experiences. We also provide practical recommendations on cabin crew improvement, turbulence management, seating arrangements, public campaigns and technological innovation, which may make depressed passengers more comfortable on board. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2025,United States,XGate: Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Transparent and Trustworthy API Traffic Management in IoT Sensor Networks,"<title>XGate: Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Transparent and Trustworthy API Traffic Management in IoT Sensor Networks</title> <abstract>The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their associated application programming interfaces (APIs) has significantly increased the complexity of sensor network traffic management, necessitating more sophisticated and transparent control mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce XGate, a novel explainable reinforcement learning framework designed specifically for API traffic management in sensor networks. XGate addresses the critical challenge of balancing optimal routing decisions with the interpretability demands of network administrators operating large-scale IoT deployments. Our approach integrates transformer-based attention mechanisms with counterfactual reasoning to provide human-comprehensible explanations for each traffic management decision across distributed sensor data streams. Through extensive experimentation on three large-scale sensor API traffic datasets, we demonstrate that XGate achieves 23.7% lower latency and 18.5% higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art black-box reinforcement learning approaches. More importantly, our user studies with sensor network administrators ( (Formula presented.) ) reveal that XGate’s explanation capabilities improve operator trust by 67% and reduce intervention time by 41% during anomalous sensor traffic events. The theoretical analysis further establishes probabilistic guarantees on explanation fidelity while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time sensor data management. XGate represents a significant advancement toward trustworthy AI systems for critical IoT infrastructure, providing transparent decision making without sacrificing performance in dynamic sensor network environments. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"
2025,Austria - Germany,Assessing the Speed–Accuracy Tradeoff in Psychological Testing Using Experimental Manipulations,"<title>Assessing the Speed–Accuracy Tradeoff in Psychological Testing Using Experimental Manipulations</title> <abstract>The speed–accuracy tradeoff (SAT), where increased response speed often leads to decreased accuracy, is well established in experimental psychology. However, its implications for psychological assessments, especially in high-stakes settings, remain less understood. This study presents an experimental approach to investigate the SAT within a high-stakes spatial ability assessment. By manipulating instructions in a within-subjects design to induce speed variations in a large sample (N = 1,305) of applicants for an air traffic controller training program, we demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating working speed. Our findings confirm the presence of the SAT for most participants, suggesting that traditional ability scores may not fully reflect performance in high-stakes assessments. Importantly, we observed individual differences in the SAT, challenging the assumption of uniform SAT functions across test takers. These results highlight the complexity of interpreting high-stakes assessment outcomes and the influence of test conditions on performance dynamics. This study offers a valuable addition to the methodological toolkit for assessing the intraindividual relationship between speed and accuracy in psychological testing (including SAT research), providing a controlled approach while acknowledging the need to address potential confounders. Future research may apply this method across various cognitive domains, populations, and testing contexts to deepen our understanding of the SAT’s broader implications for psychological measurement. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract>"
2025,United States,After the Accident: Is There a Blame Bias Against the Airline?,"<title>After the Accident: Is There a Blame Bias Against the Airline?</title> <abstract>Based on the deontological ethical perspective and concepts from blame psychology such as the defensive attribution hypothesis and culpable control, it is argued that people are predisposed to blame a transportation company when it is involved in an accident. This was tested in a scenario of an airline accident of uncertain cause, finding that respondents blamed the airline the most among a list of five blamable entities (pilots, mechanics-maintenance-inspectors, the weather, ground crew-air traffic control, and airline). Additionally, based on the virtue theory of ethics and the moral character perspective of blame psychology, it was hypothesized that manipulation of the virtue of the airline (mercenary versus altruistic) would result in less blame assigned to the altruistic airline in a quasi-experiment where the other factor was outcome of the accident (safe landing with a few injuries versus crash with many fatalities). However, the two factors significantly interacted in an unexpected way. The mercenary airline suffering a crash was blamed less than the altruistic airline that crashed, while the mercenary airline that safely landed was blamed more than the altruistic airline that safely landed. The managerial implications of blame bias toward the company are addressed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.</abstract>"

Such an assessment is significant for controller training and remote tower system design. This study employed the SART scale to compare controllers’ SA scores in traditional and remote tower environments. Results revealed significant differences, especially in attention demand and situational understanding. Subsequently, a quantitative analysis of controllers’ perception, understanding, and decision-making abilities was conducted, integrating subjective and objective data. Eye-tracking, heart rate, working memory scales, and communication-coordination scales showed significant results. Experienced controllers had better psychological safety skills, while trainees were more likely to increase vigilance. Moreover, a series of sensitive SA indicators were identified. An evaluation index system was established using the entropy weight method. By calculating the Euclidean distance, Gray relational degree, and comprehensive proximity coefficient, the SA levels of controllers were comprehensively evaluated. The top five important indicators were average blink rate, scan length, average fixation duration, fixation duration, and average pupil diameter. These findings support enhancing air traffic control safety and refining SA assessment for remote tower controllers. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"
2025,Australia,Identifying Human Factor Causes of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Safety Occurrences in Australia,"<title>Identifying Human Factor Causes of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Safety Occurrences in Australia</title> <abstract>Remotely piloted aircraft are a fast-emerging sector of the aviation industry. Although technical failures have been the largest cause of accident occurrences for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPASs), if they are to follow the path of conventionally crewed aviation, Human Factors (HFs) will increasingly contribute to accidents as the technology of RPASs improves. Examining an RPAS accident database from 2008–2019 for HF-caused accidents and coding to the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) taxonomy, an exploration of RPAS HFs is carried out and the predominant HF issues for RPAS pilots identified. The majority of HF accidents were coded to the Unsafe Acts level of the HFCAS. Skill errors, depth perception and environmental issues were the largest contributors to HF RPAS safety occurrences. A comparison with other sectors of aviation is also made where perception issues were found to be a greater contributor to occurrences for RPAS pilots than for other sectors of aviation. Developing appropriate training programs to develop skilled RPAS operators with good depth perception can contribute to a reduction in RPAS accident rates. The importance of reporting RPAS incidents is also discussed. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"

Addressing these issues requires innovative approaches for optimizing road network utilization. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in dynamic scenarios like traffic management, their primary focus has been on single-agent setups, limiting their applicability to real-world multi-agent systems. Managing agents and fostering collaboration in a multi-agent reinforcement learning scenario remains a challenging task. This paper introduces a cooperative multi-agent federated reinforcement learning algorithm named FLDQN to address the challenge of agent cooperation by solving travel time minimization challenges in dynamic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios. FLDQN leverages federated learning to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among intelligent agents, optimizing vehicle routing and reducing congestion in dynamic traffic environments. Using the SUMO simulator, multiple agents equipped with deep Q-learning models interact with their local environments, share model updates via a federated server, and collectively enhance their policies using unique local observations while benefiting from the collective experiences of other agents. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FLDQN achieves a significant average reduction of over 34.6% in travel time compared to non-cooperative methods while simultaneously lowering the computational overhead through distributed learning. FLDQN underscores the vital impact of agent cooperation and provides an innovative solution for enabling agent cooperation in a multi-agent environment. © 2025 by the authors.</abstract>"

The level of competency of maintenance technicians directly affects the safety and effectiveness of maintenance operations and flight operations. The aim of this study is to determine the safety culture and responsibility competencies and assessment methods for AMTs. Data related to the study were collected by conducting individual interviews and focus group discussions with 83 participants. The data were analyzed using the content analysis method and coding technique. As a result of individual interviews and focus group discussions with the participants, it was decided to use “safety perception (30.14%),” “aviation culture (29.58%),” “personal protective equipment (PPE) (28.73%),” “risk perception (6.48%),” and “occupational health and safety (5.07%)” to assess safety culture competency. It was decided to use “attendance (40.08%),” “work ethics (25.95%),” “reporting and suggestion (18.99%),” and “health and wellness (14.98%)” to assess responsibility competency. It has been determined that individuals such as technicians with relevant competencies, human factors specialists, and aviation psychology specialists should take part as assessors, as well as safety management system (SMS), quality, and human resources units in the assessment processes of the competencies. © 2025, Departamento de Ciencia e Tecnologia Aeroespacial.

2025,China,Perception and performance: Evaluating driver behavior on horizontal curves at day and night based on optical flow model analysis,"<title>Perception and performance: Evaluating driver behavior on horizontal curves at day and night based on optical flow model analysis</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates the interaction between human perception and driver behavior on horizontal curves, focusing on how road geometry and visibility affect driving performance. Methods: A driving simulator replicated 3 curve types by radius—200 m (sharp), 400 m (moderate), and 600 m (loose)—under day and night conditions. The focus of expansion (FOE) is the source point of optical flow, and an FOE model was established to linked the driver’s visual perception with vehicle dynamics. Data on eye movement and vehicle dynamics were collected from 24 drivers (mean age: 27 years, mean driving experience: 3.8 years). Results: The results indicate that driving at night on sharp curves significantly impairs the ability of drivers to align their perception with vehicle motion, leading to delayed steering adjustments and increased lateral errors. The most dangerous areas, identified as the back half of the test curves and corresponding to the minimum FOE radius, were where the misalignment between perception and motion was most significant. On loose curves, decreased driver vigilance was observed, potentially due to a perceived reduction in steering demands, underscoring the role of psychological and contextual factors during curve negotiation. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of optimizing curve radii and enhancing the alignment between drivers’ visual perceptions and vehicle dynamics to reduce accident risks. In real traffic, placing traffic guidance mid-curve may better prompt drivers to slow down, particularly at night. Integrating FOE-based feedback into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) could further enhance performance by offering real-time cues tailored to curve geometry in low visibility. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

However, increased task complexity may influence air traffic controllers’ SA and cognitive workload. Meanwhile, eye-tracking provides insights into the gaze patterns that might signify SA. This article investigates the gaze behaviours, SA and cognitive workload of different radar screen monitoring tasks with varying task complexity. Methods. Twenty-eight participants performed three radar screen monitoring tasks, including call-sign association, position identification and heading projection. Cognitive workload and SA were evaluated for each task using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) and situational awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT), respectively. The Gaussian mixture model was used to cluster the SA into high/low. Eye-tracking reveals the gaze behaviours that may contribute to the SA formation. Results. Cognitive workload and SA significantly differ between different levels of task complexity. While task complexity has a significant main effect on the fixations of human operators, it does not significantly influence the pupil diameter. Conclusions. Fixation-related metrics may signify the changes in SA under varying task complexity, while the side effects of cognitive workload should be mitigated. © 2025 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).</abstract>"

Empirical data were collected from 183 flight attendants with over 1 year of experience in the airline industry. Initial responses were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, revealing that burnout symptoms are driven by four factors: physical, emotional, socio-relational, and attitudinal. Subsequent data analysis indicated that all four factors significantly impact absenteeism and turnover intentions. Furthermore, emotional intelligence was found to play a significant moderating role in the relationship between burnout symptoms and absenteeism. As burnout symptoms increase, absenteeism levels rise, leading to higher turnover intentions. Finally, absenteeism was found to lead to turnover intentions. Possible interpretations and managerial implications are discussed. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>"
2025,,The Feeling of Fatigue Scale for Brazilian Fighter Pilots,"<title>The Feeling of Fatigue Scale for Brazilian Fighter Pilots</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Fighter pilots are a population particularly vulnerable to developing mental fatigue, which puts the safety of military operations at risk. Although there is no gold standard tool for its assessment, Yoshitake's Feeling of Fatigue Scale (FFS) appears promising for application to fighter pilots as it has already been validated for Brazilian commercial airline pilots. The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the FFS in Brazilian fighter pilots. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, carried out between March-August 2023, with 58 fighter pilots operating F-5M and JAS 39E aircraft. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the FFS, and the Samn-Perelli Scale were applied in two moments with a maximum interval of 7 d between them. The reliability/reproducibility and agreement of the instrument were evaluated using Cronbach's α, Cohen's κ test (for categorical variables), and the intraclass correlation coefficient for numerical variables in the test-retest. Criterion validation was carried out using the Samn-Perelli Scale. Data were also analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences statistical software, version 25.0. RESULTS: The instrument presents good reliability, being suitable for evaluating the domains of drowsiness [a = 0.840, F = 6.241, confidence interval (CI): 0.576-0.827], concentration (a = 0.907, F = 10.739, CI: 0.726-0.894) and physical discomfort (a = 0.747, F = 3.948, CI: 0.385-0.730). The criterion validity analysis showed that the FFS is valid and accurate for assessing mental fatigue in Brazilian fighter pilots. DISCUSSION: The psychometric properties of the FFS are suitable for assessing mental fatigue in this population. Milioli Ferreira D, Morisco de Sá P, Bittencourt Ferreira D.

2025,,Cognitive and Emotional Impacts of Face Pareidolia Application Among Pilot Students,"<title>Cognitive and Emotional Impacts of Face Pareidolia Application Among Pilot Students</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Metaphoric signs, which refer to a resemblance to something absent, are, like pareidolia, strong cognitive tools that help us understand abstract concepts by relating them to concrete, sensory experiences, and these have not been studied in student pilots. Evaluating the characteristics of students in aviation, including sensory experiences such as stress, decision-making, and pattern recognition, is important for safe flight. This study aims to investigate the cognitive and emotional impacts of face pareidolia among pilot students by using the digital Pareidolia Test (PT). METHODS: Subjects were 86 students from the Professional Pilot B.Sc. PROGRAM: PT includes 10 face and 10 pareidolia images. The number of European Aviation Safety Agency flight and simulator training hours, stress levels, and perceiving emotion in the pareidolia and face images were assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to test normality, and the Chi-squared test was used to analyze differences. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences in perceiving emotion in facial images based on stress levels from flight training from faculty courses (N = 42/86, 49.9%), and perceiving faces in pareidolia images related to flight simulator training hours. Perceiving emotions in pareidolia images varied significantly based on the number of European Aviation Safety Agency tests, but perceiving faces on pareidolia images did not show significant differences. DISCUSSION: We claim that incorporating pareidolia in aviation training enhances pilots' pattern recognition abilities, facilitating more accurate decision-making. The research recommends using the new digital PT in professions that require attention, such as pilots, to evaluate these parameters. Akdeniz G, Yilmaz HE, Geza H.

2025,Thailand,The impact mechanism of competency and professional identity on career success: evidence from cabin crew of Chinese Xiamen Airlines,"<title>The impact mechanism of competency and professional identity on career success: evidence from cabin crew of Chinese Xiamen Airlines</title> <abstract>In China, about 20% of cabin crew positions become vacant every year due to reasons such as transfer or separation, a phenomenon that seriously threatens the stability of the cabin crew team and the service quality of airlines. The study aims to analyze how cabin crew’s competency and professional identity affect their career success, with the aim of providing airlines with practical guidance on cabin crew training and human resource management. This study constructed a theoretical model based on competency theory, career identity theory, and career success theory, and tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling by distributing questionnaires to 500 cabin crew members of Xiamen Airlines, and analyzed the differences using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of the study showed that: (1) cabin crew’s competency has a significant positive effect on professional identity; (2) cabin crew’s competency has a significant positive effect on career success; (3) cabin crew’s professional identity has a significant positive effect on career success; (4) professional identity plays a mediating role between competency and career success; and (5) there are significant differences between cabin crew with different educational backgrounds in terms of competency, professional identity and career success. © 2024 The Author(s).

2025,Sweden,Is it safe to be safe? Examining underreporting and presenteeism among European pilots: The role of employment type,"<title>Is it safe to be safe? Examining underreporting and presenteeism among European pilots: The role of employment type</title> <abstract>Background: Atypical employment among pilots is a growing concern in the European aviation industry. Following deregulation, atypical forms of employment (e.g., being employed by subsidiaries or agencies, or on a temporary basis) have become more common, raising concerns about their implications for flight safety and pilots’ safety behaviors. It is suggested that pilots in such forms of employment experience greater job insecurity and will thus refrain from certain safety behaviors as it is more advantageous to their tenure. Method: This cross-sectional survey study aimed at examining deviations in safety behaviors, such as underreporting and presenteeism (attending work while ill), with regards to typically and atypically employed pilots (N = 4,546). Results: Pilots in atypical employment reported significantly higher frequencies of both presenteeism (47.5% vs. 31%) and underreporting (59.5% vs. 41.2%) when compared to their typically employed counterparts. Those atypically employed were more likely to cite fear of disciplinary action or dismissal as the reason for not adhering to safety practices. Underreporting and presenteeism were common, with organizational barriers, e.g., lack of feedback, being primary drivers, in line with previous research. Personal financial reasons were the most prevalent factor motivating presenteeism, regardless of employment type. Conclusion: The present study highlights the frequent occurrence of presenteeism and underreporting in the European aviation industry, highlighting a need for regulatory, organizational, and safety management attention to address these inclinations. While employment type is associated with these behaviors, further research is needed to understand better the mechanisms influencing pilots’ decisions to underreport and attend work in unfit states. © 2024 The Author(s)</abstract>"
2025,China,Supporting driver performance in closely spaced tunnel-interchange structure: Traffic control devices and effects on driving behavior,"<title>Supporting driver performance in closely spaced tunnel-interchange structure: Traffic control devices and effects on driving behavior</title> <abstract>Objectives: With the rapid development of expressways in the mountainous regions of southwestern China, closely spaced tunnel-interchange structures have inevitably emerged due to topographical constraints and environmental limitations. Given the unfavorable road geometry and rapid cross-section transitions, drivers face significant safety concerns. This study aims to investigate drivers’ safety performance at closely spaced tunnel-interchange sections and determine how safety risks can be mitigated through improved traffic control devices design. Methods: Thirty-nine participants conducted an experimental study in a fixed-base simulator. The test scenario was modeled on the Xingyan Freeway-S3801 and accurately reproduced in the simulator. For each safety performance metric, the driving simulator experiments yielded a dataset with 780 observations. To address the idiosyncratic variation due to individual driver differences, a series of linear mixed effects models (LMM) were developed to analyze drivers’ behavior responses. Results: In closely spaced tunnel-interchange sections, a general impairment of both longitudinal and lateral performance was observed. This study identified potential critical impact variables in traffic control device systems. According to the LMM results: (a) Removing the 0.5 km interchange ramp exit advance guide sign located in the tunnel exit area reduces dangerous behavior in the corresponding impact area. (b) Replacing the 0.5 km interchange ramp exit advance guide sign with arrow pavement markers as an information source supports improved driver performance, promoting driver safety. (c) Adding tunnel exit distance signs within tunnels is recommended to enhance situation awareness for drivers. Conclusions: This study addresses the scientific issues related to traffic control devices setup for closely spaced tunnel-interchange sections, focusing on identifying potential critical impact variables. The findings provide guidance on the design of traffic control devices for such sections and support revisions to national engineering standards. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2025,United Kingdom,"Examining flight time, cognitive reflection, workload, stress and metacognition on decision making performance for pilots during flight simulation","<title>Examining flight time, cognitive reflection, workload, stress and metacognition on decision making performance for pilots during flight simulation</title> <abstract>Despite technological advancements, human decision errors still contribute to civil aviation accidents. This study investigated whether flight time, cognitive reflection, task-load, metacognition, and perceived stress predicted decision-making (DM) performance during two in-flight training simulations with 104 commercial pilots at Bogota International Airport. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the predictors accounted for 56% of the variance. Cognitive reflection, flight time and performance task load emerged as significant positive predictors. Cognitive reflection significantly moderated the relationship between flight time and DM performance, with pilots scoring lower on cognitive reflection showing improved DM with increased flight time, while controlling for performance task load. The study did not find significant relationships between stress metacognition and DM performance. The study emphasises the significance of advanced training methods in improving pilots’ DM, especially for those with low cognitive reflection. Future research should expand to multiple airlines, address gender balance, and incorporate direct measures of metacognitive monitoring. © 2024 The Author(s).

2025,Brazil,Variations in mood states among Brazilian air force pilots: a crossover analysis between operational and aerobatic flight missions,"<title>Variations in mood states among Brazilian air force pilots: a crossover analysis between operational and aerobatic flight missions</title> <abstract>Background: Aerobatic flight maneuvers expose military pilots to a confluence of physiological and psychological stressors—including sustained G-forces, vestibular disorientation, and neuromuscular fatigue—that may acutely modulate emotional states and compromise cognitive performance. However, the differential psychometric impact of routine operational flights versus high-intensity air demonstrations remains poorly characterized. Purpose: To examine and compare mood state fluctuations elicited by distinct aerial mission profiles—operational maintenance (OM) flights and aerobatic demonstrations (AD)—within a specialized military pilot cohort. Methods: In this within-subject, crossover experimental design, nine elite male aviators (mean age: 32.1 ± 1.8 years) from the Brazilian Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron (EDA), each with >1,000 cumulative flight hours, were assessed across two mission contexts. Mood states were measured pre- and post-flight using the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), which evaluates six psychological dimensions: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Paired comparisons were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Results: OM flights were associated with a statistically significant increase in depression scores post-flight (p = 0.031), alongside a non-significant trend toward decreased tension (p = 0.098). Other subscales showed no statistically significant variation, though intra-individual variability was observed. Conclusion: Emotional reactivity among high-performance military pilots varies according to mission typology. Incorporating continuous affective monitoring and routine psychological assessments may bolster both operational readiness and mental health preservation in high-demand aviation environments. © © 2025 Santana, Pivetta, Da Silva, Campos, Farinatti, Almeida, Verame, Brandão and Figueira Junior.</abstract>"
2025,China,Emotion Transition Recognition Using Multimodal Physiological Signal Fusion,"<title>Emotion Transition Recognition Using Multimodal Physiological Signal Fusion</title> <abstract>Most existing emotion recognition studies rely on discrete stimulus paradigms under controlled laboratory conditions, failing to capture the inherently dynamic and transitional nature of emotional states encountered in real-world operational environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach for emotion transition recognition using multimodal physiological signal fusion. Thirty participants, including 10 licensed pilots and 20 non-pilots controls, were recruited to view 48 video stimuli de-signed to elicit six distinct emotional transitions. We introduce a two-stage progressive recognition framework to enhance performance in emotional transition modeling. In Stage I, differential entropy features extracted from EEG signals are integrated with Big Five personality traits to construct an occupation-based trait classification model, capturing cognitive-emotional patterns associated with occupational background and providing individualized priors. In Stage II, we develop the temporal spatial embed ding bidirectional cross-attention fusion network (TSE-BCAF), which employs parallel convolutional modules to extract deep spatial features from multimodal EEG and EOG signals. These features are fused via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to model inter-modal interactions, then processed by a Trans former-based temporal encoder to capture the evolving dynamics of emotional transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal baselines in both accuracy and robustness. The findings highlight the potential of our approach for real-world applications in aviation psychology and other high stakes domains requiring adaptive emotional regulation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.</abstract>"
2025,Canada - United States,"""You're a trainee telling your consultant to hold their question until later"": Using a resident-led faculty development workshop to explore trainee-consultant expertise role-reversal","<title>""You're a trainee telling your consultant to hold their question until later"": Using a resident-led faculty development workshop to explore trainee-consultant expertise role-reversal</title> <abstract>Background: Medical education traditionally involves directional flow of knowledge/skills/attitudes from a senior to junior individual. However, medical training also provides opportunities for expertise role-reversal, where the direction of flow is reversed. Unlike fields such as aviation, medicine has not yet begun to fully realise the educational potential of this approach. Objective: To better understand how role-reversal is viewed by medical education participants, necessary for its use as a tool to advance both education and patient care. Methods: A senior resident designed and led a feedback-writing workshop for her own consultants (conducted 2022). After the session, eight consultants were interviewed in a semi-structured format. Analysis was conducted using the Stenfors-Hayes phenomenographical approach. Results: A multiplicity of experiential perspectives was identified by both consultants (teacher/participant/supporter/hierarchy member/colleague/holder of multiple perspectives) and trainee (presenter/subordinate/learner/researcher). The exercise increased appreciation and awareness of the complexity of the trainee-consultant educational-power relationship, though both parties maintained traditional hierarchy despite altered informational flow. Participants often held multiple articulated experiential perspectives simultaneously. Conclusions: Consultants were able to assume a learning mindset while simultaneously maintaining awareness of their existing hierarchical relationship to the trainee-presenter; the trainee, conversely, struggled to adopt the teacher mindset. Deliberately viewing moments where trainees present new information to consultants as expertise role-reversal may provide a starting point for more equitable knowledge exchange between both parties in the clinical routine, and a foil for epistemic injustice. Increasing recognition and use of expertise role reversal can play a critical role in improving educational culture.; Hintergrund: Während der ärztlichen Ausbildung werden traditionellerweise Wissen und Fähigkeiten von erfahrenen Ärzt:innen und Fachkräften auf die auszubildenden Ärzt:innen übertragen. Die Ausbildung bietet jedoch auch Gelegenheiten zur didaktischen Rollenumkehr, wo ältere oder erfahrenere Ärzt:innen von jüngeren lernen. Im Gegensatz z.B. zur Luftfahrt, ist dieser Ansatz in der Medizin in seinem didaktischen Potential noch nicht gründlich erforscht. Zielsetzung: Die Zielsetzung dieser Studie ist es, zu untersuchen, wie Teilnehmende an einer ärztlichen Fortbildung eine didaktische Rollenumkehr erleben. Dies könnte sowohl in der Ausbildung als auch in der Praxis zu Verbesserungen der Zusammenarbeit und des Wissensaustauschs führen. Projektbeschreibung: Ein:e Ärzt:in im 2. Jahr ihrer Facharztausbildung (Onkologie, „resident“ im kanadischen Ausbildungssystem) führte eine an ihre Ausbilder („consultants“) gerichtete Fortbildung durch. Das Thema der Fortbildung war das Verfassen von schriftlichem Feedback. Acht an der Fortbildung teilnehmende Fachärzt:innen und die vortragende Ärzt:in nahmen danach an halbstrukturierten Interviews teil; die Daten wurden phenomenografisch nach Stenfor-Hayes ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Es konnten mehrere Perspektiven identifiziert werden, auf deren Basis die anwesenden Fachärzt:innen und die auszubildende Ärzt:in die Fortbildung bewerteten. Dazu gehörten: Lehrkraft, Workshop-Teilnehmer:in, Unterstützer:in, Kolleg:in, Vorgesetze:r innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie (Fachärzt:innen), bzw Vortragende, Untergebene, Forscher:in (vortragende Assistenzärzt:in). Teilnehmende beschrieben auch mehrere gleichzeitig eingenommene Perspektiven. Die Fortbildung führte allseits zu einer klaren Anerkennung und tieferem Verständnis des Arbeitsverhältnisses und der Ausbildungsverantwortung zwischen Lehrkräften und Auszubildenden. Die deutlich unterschiedlichen Positionen in der traditionellen Hierarchie wurden jedoch durchweg gefühlt eingehalten, trotz der umgekehrten Richtung der didaktischen Tätigkeit. Schlussfolgerung: Fachärzt:innen und auch der/die anwesende Chefärzt:in konnten sich in die Rolle der/des Lernenden hineinversetzen, obwohl sie sich gleichzeitig der Verantwortung und Weisungsbefugtheit gegenüber der auszubildenden Ärzt:in bewusst waren. Diese jedoch tat sich zunächst schwer damit, innerlich die Rolle der Lehrkraft einzunehmen. Im klinischen Alltag gibt es häufig Situationen, in denen Assistenzärzt:innen, PJler, usw Fachärzt:innen oder Chefärzt:innen neue oder zusätzlich Informationen zu ihren Patienten geben, und solche Situationen könnten auch als didaktische Rollenumkehr aufgefasst werden. Falls eine situationsbezogen bewusste didaktische Rollenumkehr zu einer akzeptierten Praxis während der ärztliche Ausbildung werden sollte, könnte dies auch der epistemischen Ungerechtigkeit entgegenwirken, die sonst leicht aufgrund der Differenzen innerhalb der medizinischen Hierarchie auftreten kann und etwaige wichtige Beiträge und Einblicke innerhalb eines Teams unterbinden kann. © © 2025 Preti et al.</abstract>"

Additionally, it considers the moderating role of service climate (SC). Design/methodology/approach – The research utilized a self-report questionnaire completed by a sample of 391 Vietnamese Airlines flight attendants. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings – The results indicated that PsyCap does not directly influence SRP; instead, the effect of PsyCap on SRP is fully mediated by MH and WE. Furthermore, when flight attendants perceive their organization as fostering a favorable service climate, the impact of WE on SRP is strengthened. Practical implications – The author proposes practical strategies to enhance service recovery among Vietnamese Airlines flight attendants. These insights provide valuable information for the sector, empowering decision-makers. Originality/value – This research makes a significant contribution to the limited academic literature on the subject by providing statistical evidence of the relationships among a set of variables. While PsyCap is recognized as a crucial personal resource in service industries, there is a lack of research on its impact within the airline sector. This study highlights the importance of PsyCap for MH, WE, and SRP. Additionally, it addresses the gap in existing literature by demonstrating the moderating role of SC between WE and SRP. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited</abstract>"

Methods: Data were collected from 357 ATCs using established questionnaires measuring job satisfaction, burnout, and safety behavior. Bootstrap analysis was employed to examine the mediating effect of burnout, and a decision tree model was applied to determine the key factors influencing safety behavior. Results: The bootstrap analysis revealed that burnout partially mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and safety behavior, accounting for 40% of the total effect. The decision tree model identified burnout as the primary predictor of safety behavior, followed by job satisfaction and other factors. Discussion: These findings underscore the critical role of burnout in influencing ATCs’ safety performance. Enhancing safety behavior should prioritize targeted interventions to reduce burnout, in addition to addressing job satisfaction and other contributing factors. © © 2025 Li, Huang, Peng, Zhang, Liu, Luo and Guo.</abstract>"

In the stratosphere, when the aircraft cockpit is depressurized, the pilot switches to breathing pressurized oxygen. However, breathing under such conditions leads to the development of adverse processes that affect the functional state of the body and reduce the quality of aircraft piloting. Programs of psychophysiological training of pilots for such conditions include breathing and speech training under oxygen overpressure. Objective. Effectiveness assessment of a five-day breathing and speech training course under oxygen overpressure in Vietnamese test subjects. Materials and methods. The study involved 35 Vietnamese test subjects aged 19-32. The assessment of the development of breathing skills under oxygen overpressure (OOP) was based on the dynamics of psychological parameters and the pronunciation accuracy of control words. The study used a KM-35 demand oxygen mask in combination with a ZSh-7A pilot protective helmet and a VKK-15 altitude compensating suit to create counterpressure on the chest. OOP was created using the BARS-GD hardware and software complex. The developed course of breathing and speech training under OOP consists of five OOP breathing sessions, which are conducted once a day during five consecutive days. Each session involves breathing under OOP in a sequential and continuous manner at five stages with a breathing time of 2 min at each stage. OOP was created at levels ranging 150-1000 mmHg. The functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) was assessed based on the average time of simple and complex visual-motor reactions (SVMR, CVMR) and the response to a moving object (RMO). The level of situational anxiety, well-being, activity, and mood was assessed using the wellbeing, activity, mood (WAM) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 26 software. Results. As a result of the five-day training course, a statistically significant decrease in the pre-stress level of situational anxiety by 3.9% was observed. Prior to the training course, in the setting of simulated rapid cockpit decompression, a decrease in well-being and mood indicators by 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively, was noted. In addition, the experiment recorded an increase in psychophysiological reserves, which was confirmed by statistically significant changes in the time of simple and complex visual-motor reactions, as well as the results of testing the response to a moving object before and after the training course. Conclusions. The data obtained confirmed the effectiveness of the developed five-day training course, as a result of which the test subjects increased their psychological and psychophysiological readiness to perform tasks under conditions of a sharp decrease in pressure in the pressurized cabin of an aircraft and the operation of high-altitude equipment. The developed five-day training regime of Vietnamese military personnel is recommended for integration into the training system of pilots for high-altitude and stratospheric flights. © A.А.

2025,China,Pilot Performance on Original and Modified Attitude Indicators with and without Acute Stress,"<title>Pilot Performance on Original and Modified Attitude Indicators with and without Acute Stress</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: S patial disorientation and stress pose significant threats to flight safety. The attitude indicator (AI) is crucial for pilots to maintain spatial orientation. This study aims to investigate pilot performance with the original and a modified AI under stress and nonstress conditions. METHODS: T here were 52 pilots recruited and divided into a control group and a stress group. The stress group underwent the Trier Social Stress Test to induce acute stress, while the control group performed a nonstress task. Both groups then completed flight attitude recovery tasks using the original and a modified AI. The modified AI featured two white bars added around the original AI to enhance the display of the aircraft’s attitude. RESULTS: T he stress group exhibited significantly higher heart rates (88.01 ± 14.03 bpm) and subjective anxiety scores (35.82 ± 9.41) compared to the control group (83.22 ± 6.57 bpm; 32.26 ± 5.81). In the control group, accuracy with the modified AI (94.9% ± 5.1%) was significantly higher than with the original AI (91.8% ± 6.6%). Additionally, the modified AI reduced pitch reversal errors and roll reversal errors. In the stress group, the modified AI increased accuracy for smaller initial pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. DISCUSSION: T he addition of visual cues in the periphery of the AI improved performance under nonstressed conditions. Under stress, the visual cues enhanced accuracy for smaller pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. These findings provide insights for the ergonomic design of cockpit instruments. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,New Zealand,Appropriate Screening Tests to Assess Post-COVID-19 Cognitive Dysfunction in Aeromedical Settings,"<title>Appropriate Screening Tests to Assess Post-COVID-19 Cognitive Dysfunction in Aeromedical Settings</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID-19, 10–20% of individuals may experience long-term symptoms (some having cognitive deficits), even after mild or nonsymptomatic infection. A sufficiently sensitive screening test of cognitive function, based on the typical cognitive effects of COVID-19 and skills considered most relevant to pilot performance, would be highly beneficial to be used alongside other performance checks. This study aimed to identify appropriate screening tests for post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: I nitially, a systematic search and narrative review identified 13 screening tools that are likely to be effective in screening pilots for post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairment. Following a more in-depth evaluation of the identified tools, five tests including the Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Color Word Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were chosen for a Delphi evaluation exercise. A two-round modified Delphi process was undertaken with international aviation medicine and psychology experts to obtain a consensus on which of the identified tests would be appropriate to screen for cognitive dysfunction in pilots. RESULTS: Based on evaluation of literature review findings and Delphi consultation with subject matter experts, the Trail Making Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were identified as quick and suitable screening tests likely to detect post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. DISCUSSION: T hese tools are objective, have good utility, are available in multiple versions, and assess cognitive abilities relevant to pilot performance. Their use for screening in aeromedical examinations would be further supported by confirming their ability to reliably detect neurocognitive impacts associated with COVID-19. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

Poorly designed flight deck warnings have negative effects on pilot performance and safety. This study aimed to give insights into how different encoding forms of warnings act on pilot performance from a cognitive modeling perspective. METHODS: Four encoding forms were designed using voice prompts and flashing messages. An Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational based model was built to simulate the perception process. Flight simulator tests were carried out with four types of warnings triggered randomly for comparison with simulation results and thereby performed model validation. Statistical tests were performed to examine the significant differences and effect sizes. RESULTS: Both cognitive models (response time 0.82 ± 0.06 s with voice vs. 1.37 ± 0.09 s without voice in static forms; 1.35 ± 0.56 s with voice vs. 1.83 ± 0.32 s without voice in flashing forms) and subjects’ response time (1.42 ± 0.37 s with voice vs. 1.53 ± 0.42 s without voice in static forms; 1.43 ± 0.44 s with voice vs. 1.65 ± 0.43 s without voice in flashing forms) suggest the benefits of using voice prompts to improve performance, while flashing forms of warnings may impose an extra burden on cognition even though they bring the benefit of attracting attention. DISCUSSION: By carrying out a joint analysis with cognitive modeling and flight simulator tests, this work shows that designers can make use of alternative sensory channels for achieving a timely transfer of attention, but with a risk of increasing cognitive load. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,United States,"The Most Common Disqualifying Medical Conditions in Army Aviators, 2016–2020","<title>The Most Common Disqualifying Medical Conditions in Army Aviators, 2016–2020</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Military aviators have long undergone enhanced medical screening to minimize accidents and deaths. U.S. Army aviators undergo a rigorous initial screening process followed by annual medical evaluations governed by published standards of medical fitness which are updated periodically. An aeromedical summary is submitted for disqualifying conditions, resulting in either a waiver of the standard or suspension of flight status. This study aimed to identify the most common disqualifying medical conditions in U.S. Army aviators in recent years and analyze trends over time. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed using 5 yr of data from the U.S. Army’s Aeromedical Epidemiological Data Repository. Incidence rates for the 10 most common disqualifying conditions, and the waiver approval rate for those conditions, were calculated. Annual incidence was calculated for hypertension aeromedical summary submissions. RESULTS: L umbar and cervical spinal disorders (101.55 and 39.26 per 10,000 aviator-years, 81.6% and 79.1% waived, respectively), obstructive sleep apnea (62.00 per 10,000 aviator-years, 93.4% waived), hearing loss (27.96 per 10,000 aviator-years, 98.0% waived), and hypertension (26.13 per 10,000 aviator-years, 97.3% waived) were the most common conditions submitted. Psychological diagnoses were also common, with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and phobias, adjustment disorder, and mood disorders having a cumulative incidence of 44.20 per 10,000 aviator-years and a waiver rate of 45.4%. Submissions for hypertension substantially decreased starting in 2019. DISCUSSION: S pine disorders are among the leading disqualifying conditions in U.S. Army aviators and metabolic conditions were submitted less often than previously reported, likely due to changes in aeromedical policy with respect to hypertension. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,China,Pilot Performance in Instrument-Based Tasks Under Acute Stress,"<title>Pilot Performance in Instrument-Based Tasks Under Acute Stress</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pilots often experience acute stress during flights, potentially affecting flight safety. The effect of acute stress on instrument-based tasks remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of acute stress on subjects’ performance in two crucial tasks: the attitude recovery task and the landing judgment task. METHODS: A total of 91 student pilots were divided into a control group and a stress group. Both groups completed a square task, with the stress group exposed to high-intensity noise to induce acute stress. Subsequently, 42 subjects performed an attitude recovery task using two formats of the attitude indicator: moving horizon and moving aircraft. The remaining 49 subjects performed a landing judgment task with three complexity levels using a landing instrument. Heart rates, trait-state anxiety scores, response times, and accuracy of the tasks were analyzed. RESULTS: Heart rates and state anxiety scores increased following stress induction. In the attitude task, the stress group responded faster than the control group in the moving-horizon format (467.55 ms vs. 491.45 ms) but had lower accuracy (98.65% vs. 99.73%). In the moving-aircraft format, response times (stress: 454.15 ms, control: 474.73 ms) and accuracy (stress: 98.55%, control: 99.38%) showed no significant differences between the two groups. In the low-complexity landing task, the stress group (1015.79 ms) responded faster than the control group (1168.17 ms). DISCUSSION: The impact of acute stress on performance depends on task complexity and stress intensity. While stress impairs performance in complex tasks by increasing errors, it enhances performance in simpler tasks by accelerating responses without compromising accuracy. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,India,Relationship between psychological contract and organisational commitment: an empirical investigation on airline cabin crew,"<title>Relationship between psychological contract and organisational commitment: an empirical investigation on airline cabin crew</title> <abstract>The study explores the link between organisational commitment (OCO) and psychological contract (PCO) among airline cabin crews. The study also investigates the moderation effect of the type of organisation and work experience in the relationship between PCO and OCO. A theoretical model with hypothesised relationship is developed and tested empirically using structural equation modelling with the data generated by means of a questionnaire survey conducted among the airline cabin crew. The study finds that: 1) There is a direct connection between PCO and OCO in the case of both employee PCO and employer PCO; 2) type of the organisation moderates the relation between: a) employer’s PCO and employees’ PCO; b) employer’s PCO and OCO. We also found that the relationship between the PCO and OCO is moderated by the organisation type in the case of cabin crew working for private airlines but not for government-owned airlines. Since a favourable PCO is favourably correlated with OCO, the study’s findings would assist airline operators in identifying the critical PCO dimensions that influence their OCO and helping them implement appropriate steps to increase their commitment to their staff. © © 2025 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</abstract>"
2025,Italy,Gemelli’s legacy in the knowledge of spatial orientation in flight,"<title>Gemelli’s legacy in the knowledge of spatial orientation in flight</title> <abstract>Agostino Gemelli, an Italian Franciscan physician and psychologist, was a pioneer in aviation psychology and spatial orientation research in the early twentieth century. This historical article explores Gemelli’s groundbreaking contributions to understanding spatial cognition, particularly in aviation contexts, decades before contemporary scientific findings. During World War I, Gemelli, a medical officer and pilot, focused on selecting pilots based on their attitudes rather than their physical abilities. His work predated crucial developments in spatial cognition, including concepts of field dependence/independence and environmental representation. Gemelli examined perception through Gestalt psychology, showing that people create mental images of space instead of just recording what they see. Gemelli critically analyzed spatial orientation, distinguishing between ground and aerial navigation and recognizing the complex interaction between internal cognitive characteristics and external environmental factors. He anticipated modern research on spatial representation, emphasizing the dynamic nature of spatial perception and individual differences in cognitive processing. This article highlights Gemelli’s insights in relation to modern science, showcasing his keen understanding of spatial cognition, pilot skills, and perception. His contributions, largely ignored after World War II, were an important early exploration of the cognitive mechanisms behind spatial orientation and aviation psychology. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2025,France,Mental health of airline pilots in France: insights from an anonymous online survey,"<title>Mental health of airline pilots in France: insights from an anonymous online survey</title> <abstract>Background: The German wings crash highlighted the need to better understand the mental health of airline pilots. Airline pilots are exposed to psychosocial risks, and they may constitute a population at risk of developing anxiety and depressive disorders. However, mental health remains difficult to assess in this population due to the risk of being declared unfit to fly. Scientific studies on mental disorders in airline pilots are rare, and the results are heterogeneous. To date, no study has been conducted describing anxiety or depressive disorders among European airline pilots. Method: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study using an anonymous online self-questionnaire. Pilots were recruited from the National Union of Airline Pilots between September 1 and October 16, 2022. Findings: Out of the 1,220 pilots surveyed, 25.4% of them suffered from anxiety according to the Hospital and Depression Scale (HAD): 14.4% suspected anxiety disorders and 11.0% confirmed anxiety disorders. Additionally, 13.1% of subjects reported depressive symptoms, including 8.9% suspected depressive disorders and 4.2% confirmed depressive disorders, according to the HAD. More than a third of the sample (40.1%) showed alcohol misuse. Interpretation: This study represents a major advancement in understanding the mental health of European airline pilots. This work highlights the need to implement prevention programs targeting profiles at risk of developing anxiety and/or depressive disorders. Our study also showed that a large proportion of subjects exhibited alcohol misuse, which requires prevention efforts to reduce health risks. In the future, conducting longitudinal studies would further strengthen our knowledge on this topic. © © 2025 Percheron, Prouvost-Keller, Allouche, Benoit and Pradier.</abstract>"
2025,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",Drivers’ perception and awareness of delay at traffic signals with countdown timers,"<title>Drivers’ perception and awareness of delay at traffic signals with countdown timers</title> <abstract>The time spent at signalised intersections significantly influences route choice decisions, with perceived time often outweighing actual time in drivers’ decision making. While psychological and behavioural studies suggest limited user awareness of temporal changes, empirical evidence in transportation remains scarce. This study examines how drivers perceive and report stop times at signalised intersections and assesses their sensitivity to variations in delay. In addition, it explores how different signal displays – conventional signal devices (CSD), hourglass displays (HD), and continuous countdown timers (CCT) – shape drivers’ time perception. Data were collected through roadside interviews and field measurements at three intersections in Iran. Findings indicate that while drivers often overlook minor differences in stop times, they correctly discern broader trends. Notably, time reporting was more consistent among drivers exposed to CCTs, where stop times were under-reported by approximately 20%. In contrast, HD and CSD led to over-reporting by about 15%. The results highlight CCT’s superiority in improving time awareness and reporting accuracy compared to HD and CSD. These insights underscore the importance of signal display design in shaping driver perception and suggest that countdown timers could enhance traffic management strategies by aligning perceived and actual stop times more effectively. © 2025 ICE Publishing.

2025,Poland,IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON LIFESTYLE HABITS AND BODY WEIGHT OF MILITARY FLYING PERSONNEL OF THE POLISH ARMED FORCES,"<title>IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON LIFESTYLE HABITS AND BODY WEIGHT OF MILITARY FLYING PERSONNEL OF THE POLISH ARMED FORCES</title> <abstract>Background: The aim of this study was to assess whether and to what extent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic affected the lifestyle and body weight of military flying personnel. Material and Methods: The study involved 930 Polish soldiers –members of aircrew. The study was conducted by using a survey designed by the author, as part of the implementation of the National Health Programme 2021–2025. The survey used the research technique computer assisted web interview. Results: Approximately half of the soldiers surveyed (49%) declared that they did not contract COVID-19. Analysis of the results on the frequency of consumption of selected food items showed that most food items respondents consumed at similar levels during the pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period. There was a positive increase in the frequency of consumption of nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables in 14.8%, 15.9% and 19% of respondents, respectively. More than 20% of those surveyed declared that they consumed less restaurant meals, fast food, sweets and sugary drinks. The vast majority of the respondents (77.6%) answered that they did not feel more negative emotions compared to the pre-pandemic period COVID-19 and emotions did not affect their diet. The frequency of physical activity remained the same for 71.9% of soldiers, while 14.9% respondents said they played sport less often than before the pandemic. Overweight was diagnosed in 50.2% of respondents, while 12.8% were obese. More than half of the respondents (56%) declared that their weight had not changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, 25.1% declared that their weight had increased and 8.9% that it had decreased. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic condition did not disrupt the existing lifestyles of most military flying personnel. More than half of the military flying personnel surveyed reported no effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight change. A quarter of soldiers reported weight gain, which was associated with negative changes in diet and physical activity. © 2025, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

2025,Germany,User acceptance of autonomous combined transport systems in Germany: a cross-conceptual view,"<title>User acceptance of autonomous combined transport systems in Germany: a cross-conceptual view</title> <abstract>The concept of autonomous combined transport utilizes autonomous vehicles for simultaneous passenger and goods transportation and is associated with a reduction in road traffic through bundling effects and economies of scale. Yet, its potential benefits particularly hinge on penetration and utilization rates. To date, few studies have explored user acceptance of systems that integrate passenger and freight flows. In this context, a research gap that is particularly evident pertains to the user acceptance of different concepts within autonomous combined transport. Extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), this paper examines the effects of six psychological constructs on the behavioral intention to use an autonomous combined transport system. Surveying 1040 respondents from Germany, two distinct combined transport concepts—scheduled and on-demand—were examined to identify key acceptance factors and operational peculiarities. Results from structural equation modelling show that the acceptance of autonomous combined transport systems depends on both, the operational concept as well as the purpose of use, with socio-demographic characteristics featuring different indirect effects per concept. Moreover, we find that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, price value, personal attitude, and trust are significant predictors of behavioral intention across both concepts, while the average order frequency of a potential user has a negative indirect impact on behavioral intention. Results show that an extended UTAUT2 model can conceptualize factors influencing autonomous combined transport acceptance, emphasizing the importance of investigating a user’s behavioral intention based on the specific operational concept. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.</abstract>"
2025,"Korea, Republic of",Dynamic Multi-Biosignal Fusion for Detecting the Mental States of Drivers and Passengers in Vehicles,"<title>Dynamic Multi-Biosignal Fusion for Detecting the Mental States of Drivers and Passengers in Vehicles</title> <abstract>As transportation systems grow in complexity and autonomous vehicle technologies advance, detecting the mental states of drivers and passengers is crucial for enhancing traffic safety and user experience. Recent studies have explored multi-biosignal fusion to monitor these states. Despite these efforts, existing methods fail to reflect the complexity and usefulness of various modalities, and do not consider the informativeness of biosignals based on signal quality or the contribution of each modality as biomarkers. To address this issue, we introduce dynamic multi-biosignal fusion (DMBF) to detect the mental states of drivers and passengers. DMBF employs a dynamic gate mechanism that estimates reliability based on data quality through confidence-aware learning, integrating this information into the learning process. Moreover, a spatial-temporal attention module is utilized to capture and combine key biosignal patterns across channels and time. Extensive evaluations were conducted on five datasets related to motion sickness, drowsiness, distraction, emotions, and sustained attention. Each dataset yielded F1 scores of 0.5569, 0.7187, 0.6647, 0.9378, and 0.8092, respectively, outperforming existing baseline models. The experimental results and ablation studies have demonstrated that DMBF is a more robust and versatile method for detecting the mental states of drivers and passengers. DMBF provides a foundation for future enhancements in traffic safety and passenger experience and has the potential for broader applications in multi-biosignal monitoring systems. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>"
2025,China,Predicting honest behavior based on Eysenck personality traits and gender: an explainable machine learning study using SHAP analysis,"<title>Predicting honest behavior based on Eysenck personality traits and gender: an explainable machine learning study using SHAP analysis</title> <abstract>Introduction: This study bridges a critical gap in aviation safety research by examining how Eysenck personality traits (Neuroticism, Psychoticism, Extraversion) and gender predict dishonest behavior in high-risk aviation contexts. While prior studies have focused on the Big Five and HEXACO models in ethical decision-making, empirical applications of the Eysenck framework to honesty prediction remain scarce-particularly in aviation, where dishonest acts (e.g., underreporting safety incidents) carry severe public safety consequences. Methods: We collected behavioral data from 102 flight and air traffic control cadets using a coin-toss task. Explainable machine learning (XGBoost) was employed to model nonlinear relationships between personality, gender, and honesty. Model performance was evaluated via AUC, with SHAP analysis identifying key predictors. Results: XGBoost achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.802). SHAP analysis revealed: (1) neuroticism as the strongest predictor of dishonesty; (2) significant gender differences (higher dishonesty rates in males); and (3) threshold effects for Psychoticism and Extraversion. Discussion: This work makes three key contributions: (1) first systematic application of the Eysenck model to aviation honesty prediction; (2) identification of gender as a critical moderating variable; and (3) development of a SHAP-driven interpretable framework that connects machine learning outputs with psychological theory. Practically, these findings enable data-driven screening of cadets' honesty tendencies during recruitment, facilitating targeted interventions for safer aviation operations. © © 2025 Meng, Peng, Zhang, Chen, Huang, Chen and Zhao.</abstract>"

The data was collected from airline passengers by utilizing the convenient sampling method. A total of 488 surveys out of 520 participants were included in the analyses conducted using Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) software. The results show that the appearances and attitudes of uniformed cabin crews significantly affect the repurchase intention, and while the brand perception only mediates the effect of attitudes on repurchase intention, the brand imagery both appearances and attitudes of uniformed cabin crews. Results suggest that airlines need to pay attention to both the attitudes and the appearance of the cabin crew to make the passengers feel that the airline is their own extent and, in return, to increase passengers’ repurchase intention. Unlike previous studies, this research focuses on the interplay between visual branding through uniforms and passengers’ psychological mechanisms driving loyalty explained by Social Identity Theory and Aesthetic Labor Theory. This research demonstrates the strategic role of cabin crew in creating a brand experience that is different but reflective of their own identity. © 2025 The Author(s).

There is still a lack of discussion about how these factors (individual, group and organizational levels) influence the adoption of mindful safety practices among commercial pilots in the aviation industry. Data were collected from a sample of commercial pilots in China within 8 months. Results show that all the identified factors contributing to the adoption of mindful safety practices are significantly and positively interrelated. The results also reveal that safety knowledge and motivation positively mediate the relationships between safety climate (group level and organization level) and pilots’ mindful safety practice adoption in the aviation industry. It is of interest that group-level safety climate exerts more impact on pilots’ safety knowledge and motivation gains. Furthermore, leader–member exchange (LMX) strengthens relationships between two dimensions of safety climate and pilots’ safety knowledge and motivation acquisitions. © 2025 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).</abstract>"

This condition impacts physiological and psychological function, causing symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and decreased oxygen saturation. Although this condition is essential for military aircraft crews who frequently operate at these altitudes, there is a lack of research that explicitly explores its impact, especially regarding subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation. Objective: To evaluate and understand the effect of hypoxia on the subjective symptoms experienced by military aircrew and its effect on their oxygen saturation when operating at high altitudes and determine the relationship of subjective symptoms differentiated by age and saturation. Methods: This is a prospective, controlled, cross-sectional study conducted at a single center, recruiting 64 military aircrew members for a one-time session that includes an intermediate phase and subsequent hypoxia exposure in a high-altitude chamber. Result: The study gathered data on physiological responses to hypobaric conditions at 25,000 feet in a hypobaric chamber, detailing subjective symptoms and reduced oxygen saturation levels during hypoxia at this altitude. Noted hypoxia symptoms included dizziness, tingling, a floating feeling, and memory lapses. Additionally, oxygen saturation levels were observed to drop below 70%. The hypoxia observed in the study was attributed to altitude, with an understanding that higher elevations result in lower partial pressure. Conclusion: These findings conclude that physiological changes in subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation occur in military aircraft crew experiencing hypoxia at an altitude of 25,000 feet. No significant correlation was found between age, saturation and the subjective symptoms experienced, except for muscle weakness, which appears to be more common in individuals over 33 years of age. © 2024 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

2024,Finland,Cardiac autonomic responses in relation to cognitive workload during simulated military flight,"<title>Cardiac autonomic responses in relation to cognitive workload during simulated military flight</title> <abstract>Understanding the operator's cognitive workload is crucial for efficiency and safety in human–machine systems. This study investigated how cognitive workload modulates cardiac autonomic regulation during a standardized military simulator flight. Military student pilots completed simulated flight tasks in a Hawk flight simulator. Continuous electrocardiography was recorded to analyze time and frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV). After the simulation, a flight instructor used a standardized method to evaluate student pilot's individual cognitive workload from video-recorded flight simulator data. Results indicated that HRV was able to differentiate flight phases that induced varying levels of cognitive workload; an increasing level of cognitive workload caused significant decreases in many HRV variables, mainly reflecting parasympathetic deactivation of cardiac autonomic regulation. In conclusion, autonomic physiological responses can be used to examine reactions to increased cognitive workload during simulated military flights. HRV could be beneficial in assessing individual responses to cognitive workload and pilot performance during simulator training. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>"

Few people endorsed bombing when the bystander was an innocent civilian; however, when the bystander’s identity was unknown, over twice as many people endorsed the bombing. Follow-up studies tested boundary conditions and found the effect to extend beyond modern-day conflicts in the Middle East, showing a similar pattern of judgment for a fictional war. Bombing endorsement was predicted by attitudes towards total war, the theory that there should be no distinction between military and civilian targets in wartime conflict. Bombing endorsement was lower for UK compared to US participants due to differences in total war attitudes. This work has implications for conflicts where unidentified bystanders are common by revealing a potentially deadly bias: people often assume unidentified bystanders are guilty unless proven innocent. ©: © 2024 Danielson et al.

2024,Israel,Cognitive performance of air personnel following sleep deprivation,"<title>Cognitive performance of air personnel following sleep deprivation</title> <abstract>Air forces have developed several methods for reducing fatigue-related accidents. In the Israeli Air Force, the “Dead Tired” workshop was developed with the purpose of presenting aircrew with their objective performance under sleep deprivation conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive abilities of both aircrew and unmanned aerial vehicle operators, both objectively and subjectively. All Israeli aircrew and unmanned aerial vehicle operators participated in a “Dead Tired” workshop. During the workshop, the participants performed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, a task that tests their attention abilities, while gathering information on their subjective sleepiness in the form of a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Data of 366 participants (25 females), of whom 187 were unmanned aerial vehicle operators and 179 were aircrew, were obtained; and the mean age was 21.8 ± 1.2 years (range 19–26 years). A significant decline in task performance was seen following 20 hr of wakefulness in both unmanned aerial vehicle operators and aircrew (p < 0.001). Unmanned aerial vehicle operators' performance was significantly better throughout the majority of the workshop (p < 0.001). Recovery after the full-night's sleep was seen for unmanned aerial vehicle operators, but not for aircrew (p = 0.008). A high correlation was seen between Psychomotor Vigilance Task performance and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale responses (correlation coefficient = 0.93). Sleep deprivation negatively impacted the performance of both groups of participants. Unmanned aerial vehicle operators were found to be more resilient to the effects of sleep deprivation and were quicker to recover in comparison to aircrew. © 2024 European Sleep Research Society.</abstract>"
2024,United States,The Role of State and Trait Self-Control on the Sustained Attention to Response Task,"<title>The Role of State and Trait Self-Control on the Sustained Attention to Response Task</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to assess the plausibility of self-control depletion, or ego-depletion, as the underlying cognitive resource responsible for performance decrements on the sustained attention to response task. Background: Researchers suggested that self-control is a limited cognitive resource used to complete a myriad of processes, including sustained attention. Past research showed that trait self-control affects some sustained attention tasks. However, little research has investigated the effect of self-control as a limited cognitive resource that varies over time (i.e., as a state-dependent variable). Methods: This experiment investigated the effect of self-control (trait and state) on a sustained motor-inhibition task (e.g., sustained attention to response task; SART). State self-control was manipulated using a between-subjects design—participants in the experimental condition completed a task designed to deplete state self-control prior to performing the SART while the control condition completed a modified version that did not deplete self-control. Results: Trait self-control predicted performance on the SART, but the depletion task (state self-control) had no detectable effect. Conclusion: Given the evidence, it is unlikely that state self-control plays a causal role in performance decrements in the SART, but there appears to be some association between performance on the SART and trait self-control. Application: Trait self-control ought to be considered in future work for personnel selection in real-world tasks that the SART models such as long-distance driving, air traffic control, and TSA operations. © 2023 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2024,United States,Performance Optimization and Injury Mitigation for Air Force Student Fighter Pilots,"<title>Performance Optimization and Injury Mitigation for Air Force Student Fighter Pilots</title> <abstract>Introduction: Military fighter aircrew report high rates of cervical pain and injury. There is currently no consensus regarding the best training methods for this population. Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) and Luke AFB have multidisciplinary teams specializing in aircrew training, performance, and injury mitigation. All student pilots (SPs) completing Basic Course training at these locations engage in an 8-week Spine Training Program (STP). The STP originated at Luke AFB in 2020 and was expanded to Eglin AFB in 2022. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether the STP led to significant changes in the performance measure studied, Cervical Endurance Hold (CEH). Further, this study aimed to determine if the CEH training effect was independent of location of STP administration. We hypothesized that SPs would exhibit statistically significant CEH training adaptations irrespective of base location. Materials and Methods: Air Force F-16 and F-35 SPs from Luke AFB and Eglin AFB were actively enrolled in the Basic Course and participated in the standardized STP from 2020 to 2023. The CEH test was administered prior to (intake) and following (exit) the 8-week STP. SPSS for Windows version 29 software (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to retrospectively analyze the data from this study. Participants were excluded if they were unable to perform the CEH test at intake or exit. The study was approved by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Results: One hundred and ninety-eight SPs (Luke AFB, males n = 170, females n = 12; Eglin AFB, males n = 16) completed the STP program. There was no significant difference between intake and exit concerning age, height, weight, % body fat, and fat-free mass at Luke AFB or Eglin AFB (P < 0.05). Statistically significant improvements in CEH were observed within all groups from intake to exit (P < 0.001). When considering all participants collectively, there was a notable 33.6% increase in CEH from intake to exit (P < 0.001) with an overall effect size of d = 1.14. When analyzing specific subgroups, females from Luke AFB experienced a significant 20.4% increase in CEH (P < 0.001, d = 1.14), males from Luke AFB exhibited a significant 34.5% increase (P < 0.001, d = 1.09), and males from Eglin AFB demonstrated a significant increase of 55.7% in CEH (P < 0.001, d = 1.97). Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed significant improvements in the CEH across all groups following the completion of the STP. Furthermore, CEH results from both bases exhibited a large effect size indicating a meaningful change was found between intake and exit regardless of training location. These preliminary study results should be interpreted with caution as a control group was unable to be established. In the future, a randomized control trial should be performed to test the STP used in this study against other STP programs. This may better inform experts on the best spine training methods for fighter aircrew. © 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.</abstract>"
2024,China,Research on the influence of bad working state on air traffic control effect based on multi-independent sample Kruskal-Wallis test,"<title>Research on the influence of bad working state on air traffic control effect based on multi-independent sample Kruskal-Wallis test</title> <abstract>This study examines the influence of bad working states on the control effect of air traffic controllers by establishing a scoring standard for control performance assessment with eight assessment items, such as the standard radiotelephony communications, and 25 specific assessment contents, such as the completeness of control instructions. Combined with equipment for tower control simulations, this standard assesses and counts the scores of controllers in different states, namely, sober, fatigue, stress, and fatigue & stress. We tested the control effect distributions of four states through the Kruskal-Wallis test and analyzed whether the bad working states were statistically significant for each control effect item. The study found that the bad working states are statistically significant for standard radiotelephony communications, flight progress strips, safety separation, instruction timing, situational awareness, and total control effect score in the control effects. Moreover, the research revealed that bad working states are not statistically significant for equipment inspection, external environment scan, and safety awareness in the control effect. Further, forced pair comparisons of the substantial control effect items showed that controllers have adverse statistically significant effects on the use of flight progress strips, situational awareness, and the total score of control effects when controllers are in a stress state. Meanwhile, they have an adverse statistically significant effect on the standard radiotelephony communications, safety separation and instruction timing, flight progress strips, situational awareness, and the total score of control effects when controllers are under a fatigue & stress state. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>"
2024,"Korea, Republic of",Effects of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome on Quality of Life Among Airline Crew,"<title>Effects of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome on Quality of Life Among Airline Crew</title> <abstract>Background: Interest in post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome following COVID-19 infection has been increasing. Maintaining quality of life (QoL) is vital for airline crews because they work in a special environment, where they are responsible for the passengers’ safety. This study aims to closely investigate factors affecting the QoL of airline crews, including post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey, comprising 167 crews. Findings: Age-specific significant differences were observed in social, overall, and total QoL scores. The physical domain QoL was significantly higher in the cockpit crews than that in the cabin crews. Significant differences were found in psychological and overall QoL depending on years of continuous service. Social domain and environmental QoL were lower in those who had no symptoms after being diagnosed with COVID-19 than in those who were symptomatic. Among the participants, 4.2% had post-COVID-19 syndrome, indicating significant differences in the physical domain, depending on whether they exhibit post-COVID-19 syndrome. Conclusion: It is urgent to develop measures to increase the QoL of airline crews, investigate post-COVID-19 syndrome before returning to work, and develop strategies to manage it. Application to practice: The QoL among airline crews differed not only by the demographic characteristics of the participants but also by the presence of symptoms during COVID-19 diagnosis and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Higher QoL among airline crews is associated with the safety of both airline crews and passengers. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a systematic management protocol for airline crews returning to work after following COVID-19 infection. © 2024 The Author(s).</abstract>"
2024,China - Japan - Sweden,Dietary Rhythmicity and Mental Health Among Airline Personnel,"<title>Dietary Rhythmicity and Mental Health Among Airline Personnel</title> <abstract>IMPORTANCE Misaligned dietary rhythmicity has been associated with metabolic diseases; however, its association with mental health remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between dietary rhythms and the mental health condition of shift workers, specifically airline crew members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected from the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China, an ongoing large-scale health survey of pilots, flight attendants, and air security officers employed by major airline companies in China. Participants aged 18 to 60 years were invited through text messages to complete a web-based survey. The data collection period was December 2022 to March 2023. Statistical analysis was performed from July 24, 2023, to April 12, 2024. EXPOSURE Data on timing of breakfast and dinner on workdays and rest days, daily time windows for food intake, and meal and eating jet lags were collected and calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the associations of anxiety and depression with meal timing, eating window time, meal jet lag (ie, delayed meals), and eating jet lag (ie, delayed eating). All models were adjusted for individual socioeconomic, demographic, and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS Of the 22 617 participants (median [IQR] age, 29.1 [26.3-33.7] years; 13 712 males [60.6%]), 1755 (7.8%) had anxiety and 2768 (12.2%) had depression. After controlling for confounding factors, having dinner after 8 PM on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.05) and depression (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.78-2.27), compared with consuming dinner before 8 PM. Similar results were observed on night-shift days and rest days. An eating window of less than 12 hours was associated with reduced odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) and depression (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89) on morning-shift days; the results remained significant on rest days. Delayed dinner on morning-shift days was associated with increased odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54) and depression (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). On night-shift days, delayed dinner was associated with higher odds of anxiety (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and depression (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36). On morning-shift days, delayed eating rhythms were associated with higher odds of depression (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.61), whereas advanced eating rhythms were associated with lower odds of anxiety (AOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that meal timing, long eating window, and meal jet lags were associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the need for interventions and supportive policies that help mitigate the adverse implications of shift work and irregular working hours for the mental health of shift workers. © 2024 American Medical Association.

2024,Austria,A Novel Approach Using Non-Experts and Transformation Models to Predict the Performance of Experts in A/B Tests,"<title>A Novel Approach Using Non-Experts and Transformation Models to Predict the Performance of Experts in A/B Tests</title> <abstract>The European Union is committed to modernising and improving air traffic management systems to promote environmentally friendly air transport. However, the safety-critical nature of ATM systems requires rigorous user testing, which is hampered by the scarcity and high cost of air traffic controllers. In this article, we address this problem with a novel approach that involves non-experts in the evaluation of expert software in an A/B test setup. Using a transformation model that incorporates auxiliary information from a newly developed psychological questionnaire, we predict the performance of air traffic controllers with high accuracy based on the performance of students. The transformation model uses multiple linear regression and auxiliary information corrections. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-experts to test expert software, overcoming testing challenges and supporting user-centred design principles. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>"
2024,United States,Quantitative analyses and empirical tests of perceptual theories of the Black Hole Illusion,"<title>Quantitative analyses and empirical tests of perceptual theories of the Black Hole Illusion</title> <abstract>The Black Hole Illusion (BHI) is a nighttime aviation landing illusion where pilots overestimate their descent angle. This dangerous illusion can cause pilots to compensate by flying lower than intended, which can result in them crashing into the ground or obstacles in front of the runway. A common interpretation of the BHI is that it is a perceptual illusion, and two quantitative perception based theories have been proposed. The first theory was developed by Perrone (1983), and it assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to the loss of contextual information surrounding the runway, such as ground texture, during nighttime landing conditions. Adapted from work by Galanis et al. (1998) and Robinson et al. (2020), the second (eye-level) theory assumes that pilots misestimate their descent angle due to loss of the horizon during nighttime landing conditions. Quantitative analyses of Perrone's theory suggest that the magnitude of the illusion should vary with runway width and length in nighttime conditions, but in daylight conditions there should be no illusion and no effect of runway width or length. Analyses of the eye-level theory predict no impact of runway width or length for any condition. Across two empirical laboratory studies, we do demonstrate a BHI for nighttime evaluations of descent angle, but the data do not support either theory. Thus, the two algorithms analyzed here are not sufficient to explain the BHI; and the BHI may reflect general disorientation due to limited information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"
2024,Poland,The role of visual conditions and aircraft type on different aspects of pilot workload,"<title>The role of visual conditions and aircraft type on different aspects of pilot workload</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of our work was to assess the impact of flight conditions by aircraft type on the workload estimated using NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Background: Learning about subjective workload is important for assessing the impact of a pilot's work environment on their performance in the cockpit. This is an important element of flight safety and includes the prevention of aviation accidents. Methods: The study included 146 military pilots that fly the following aircrafts: flying fast-jet (21), fixed-wing (24), and rotary-wing (101). The NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to assess workload and pilots were asked to determine the level of workload resulting from flying under the following conditions: daytime flight (VFR), night-vision flight performed under Night Visual Flight Rules (NVFR), and night-vision flight using night-vision goggles (NVGs). Results: The highest level of workload was consistently attributed to flights performed under NVG conditions. NVFR conditions were rated as the most burdensome, while VFR conditions were rated as the least burdensome. Fast-jet pilots rated their mental performance and effort workload as significantly higher than pilots of other aircrafts. Conclusion: Pilots’ perceived workload is influenced by both flight conditions and the type of aircraft they fly. Workload knowledge is important for flight safety and should be taken into account during training and flight-task planning. Application: The results of our study can be useful both in flight training and in work on the effectiveness of the human-machine interface. Awareness of one's own limitations due to the work environment can help improve flight safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2024,Sweden,Factors associated with approaching Pilot Peer Support: a cross-sectional study,"<title>Factors associated with approaching Pilot Peer Support: a cross-sectional study</title> <abstract>Background: Pilot Peer Support Programs (PPSP) have been introduced in Europe as a measure to facilitate commercial pilots’ mental health help-seeking in a confidential and non-punitive manner. However, research is scarce regarding what promotes and prevents pilots from approaching PPSP. Aims: To investigate if, and in which way, different organizational and individual factors are associated with pilots’ attitudes towards approaching PPSP, and to examine the prevalence of possible cases of depression and anxiety disorders among commercial pilots in Europe. Methods: Data were collected using an anonymous web-based survey (n = 4494), covering pilots’ work conditions, health and flight safety. Logistic regression was used to determine the impact of objective and psychosocial work environment factors, mental health factors, and demographic factors. Results: Key findings were that just culture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97, 3.56), type of employment (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.46, 0.78), minimum guaranteed pay (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.48, 2.65), and symptoms of depression (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.50, 0.76) and anxiety (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54, 0.80) significantly predicted pilots’ attitude towards approaching PPSP. The prevalence of pilots scoring above threshold for possible depression (18%) and anxiety disorders (23%) were determined. Conclusions: Pilot Peer Support in its current form appears to be an insufficient means to facilitate pilots’ mental health help-seeking, but could have an important preventive purpose. The findings could assist authorities and operators in developing measures to facilitate pilots’ help-seeking, and improve mental health and flight safety. © The Author(s) 2024.</abstract>"
2024,Brazil,Metabolic flexibility associated with flight time among combat pilots of the Brazilian air force,"<title>Metabolic flexibility associated with flight time among combat pilots of the Brazilian air force</title> <abstract>Introduction: Fighter pilots must support the effects of many stressors, including physical and psychological exertion, circadian disturbance, jet lag, and environmental stress. Despite the rigorous selection of military pilots, those factors predispose to failures in physiological compensatory mechanisms and metabolic flexibility. Objectives: We compared through NMR-based metabolomics the metabolic profile of Brazilian F5 fighter pilots with different flight experiences vs. the control group of non-pilots. We hypothesized that combat pilots have metabolic flexibility associated with combat flight time. Methods: We evaluated for the first time 34 Brazilian fighter pilots from Santa Cruz Air Base (Rio de Janeiro, RJ) allocated into three groups: pilots with lower total accumulated flight experience < 1,100 h (PC1, n = 7); pilots with higher total accumulated flight experience ≥ 1,100 h (PC2, n = 6); military non-pilots (CONT, n = 21). Data collection included anthropometric measurements, total blood count, lipidogram, markers of oxidative stress, and serum NMR-based metabolomics. Results: In comparison with controls (p < 0.05), pilots exhibited decreased levels of white blood cells (−13%), neutrophils (−15%), lymphocytes (−20%), alfa-glucose (−13%), lactate (−26%), glutamine (−11%), histidine (−20%), and tyrosine (−11%), but higher isobutyrate (+ 10%) concentrations. Significant correlations were found between lactate vs. amino acids in CONT (r = 0.55–0.68, p < 0.001), and vs. glutamine in PC2 (r = 0.94, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Fighter pilots with lower experience showed a dysregulation in immune-metabolic function in comparison with controls, which seemed to be counteracted by the accumulation of flight hours. Those findings might have implications for the health preservation and operational training of fighter pilots. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract>"
2024,Indonesia,A Quasi-Experimental One Group Pre-Post Test Design in Air Traffic Controller in Indonesia: Progressive Muscle Relaxation,"<title>A Quasi-Experimental One Group Pre-Post Test Design in Air Traffic Controller in Indonesia: Progressive Muscle Relaxation</title> <abstract>Objectives: The effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) in assessing the general health of air traffic controllers (ATC) is still insufficient, specifically when examining the psychological conditions of workers who use questionnaire instruments. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the use of PMR program in ATC by developing a model using biomarkers (saliva) tested on the cocorometer stress diagnostic tool and validity, including observing related determinants in the work environment. Methods: A quasi-experimental method was used, focusing on one group pre-post-test design for 92 respondents across six research areas in Indonesia. All respondents had received training in PMR methods conducted by psychologists. Subsequently, ongoing assistance was provided in implementing relaxation by a trained reminder team for eight weeks to maintain the precision and effectiveness of the intervention. Further analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the success of the intervention. Results: The implementation of PMR program in ATC reduced the incidence of stress levels after the observation. Statistically, the feeling of fatigue was a significant variable that decreased in mean value after the implementation of the relaxation program on the data review. The main benefit of PMR program in improving psychological health conditions (stress) was found in Surabaya branch ATC. Conclusions: The relaxation program was proven to reduce stress levels in ATC, showing an improvement in conditions before and after the implementation of PMR. © 2024 Phcogj.Com.</abstract>"
2024,United States,Senior Aviator Medical Qualification Status,"<title>Senior Aviator Medical Qualification Status</title> <abstract>Introduction: Aviation personnel are expensive to train and challenging for the services to retain because of lucrative opportunities in the civilian aviation sector and a desire among pilots for agency. The military services' retention efforts have typically utilized a combination of high continuation pays and longer service commitments of up to 10 years following initial training. One area that the services have overlooked in their attempts to retain senior aviators is quantifying and reducing medical disqualifications. Much as aging aircraft require increasing maintenance to retain full operational capability, so may pilots and other aircrew members. Materials and Methods: This article reports on a prospectively collected cross-sectional research study evaluating the medical status of senior aviation personnel who reported being considered or selected for command. The study was deemed exempt from human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board and a waiver of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was granted. The study, which collected data at the Pentagon Flight Medical Clinic over 1 year, used a chart review of routine medical encounters and flight physicals to collect descriptive data. The goals of the study were to establish the prevalence of medically disqualifying conditions, assess the association between disqualifying conditions and age, and generate hypotheses for further research. Logistic regression of waiver need was performed for variables including prior waivers, waiver count, service, platform, age, and gender. ANOVA of readiness percentages vs. DoD targets were assessed between the services individually and in aggregate. Results: The study demonstrated medical readiness rates among command-eligible senior aviators ranging from 74% for the Air Force to 40% for the Army with the Navy and Marine Corps in the middle. The sample was insufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in readiness between the services; however, the population as a whole was significantly below the DoD's readiness target of >90% (P =. 000). Conclusions: None of the services met the DoD minimum readiness target of 90%. Markedly higher readiness was observed in the Air Force, the only service with a medical screening incorporated into its command selection process, but this difference was not statistically significant. Waivers increased with age and musculoskeletal concerns were common. A larger prospective cohort study should be considered to further elucidate and confirm the findings of this study. If further research confirms these findings, consideration should be made of screening command applicants for medical readiness. © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

A total of 198 civil aviation pilots and 804 other civil aviation practitioners were recruited to complete surveys on mindfulness, SCL-90, job burnout, core self-evaluation, and psychological resilience. The network relationship between trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation was constructed. The results showed that trait mindfulness played an important role in the psychological adaptation network of civil aviation employees. Specifically, trait mindfulness was negatively correlated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and emotional exhaustion, and positively correlated with core self-evaluation. However, no significant difference was found in trait mindfulness and psychological adaptation network between pilots and non-pilots. These findings show that mindfulness has a unique positive effect on the psychological adaptation of civil aviation personnel. Specifically, the mindfulness trait may alleviate compulsive symptoms or reduce emotional exhaustion, enabling airline personnel to maintain a good self-evaluation. At the same time, the role of mindfulness traits in the network is similar, indicating that the positive role of mindfulness intervention in civil aviation may be universal. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</abstract>"
2024,Thailand,Investigating aviation safety factors and proposed conceptual model for safety behaviors among Thai flight crews: A qualitative approach,"<title>Investigating aviation safety factors and proposed conceptual model for safety behaviors among Thai flight crews: A qualitative approach</title> <abstract>This study aims to answer behavioral safety questions regarding influential factors and relationship among those factors relating to Thai flight crews’ safety behaviors, and the objective of this study is to develop a proposed hypotheses relating to factors affecting Thai flight crews’ safety behaviors for future research. Based on a sample of 21 flight crews and executives in Thailand, the result found that influential factors relating to Thai flight crew safety behaviors were organizational safety climate, fleet safety climate, aviation safety knowledge, aviation psychological safety and flight crews’ safety attitudes and personalities. Flight time was considered as a typical job experience and did not directly reflect the safety behaviors among flight crews. What reflected safety behaviors among flight crews were their own safety attitudes and personalities. Therefore, it would be proposed that organizational safety climate, fleet safety climate and flight attitudes and personalities played antecedent roles and aviation safety knowledge and aviation psychological safety played mediating roles. Future studies can possibly use the result from this study to formulate further hypotheses and apply the proposed conceptual model for quantitative analysis. © 2024 Kasetsart University.</abstract>"

2024,China,The influence of representational gravity on spatial orientation: an eye movement study,"<title>The influence of representational gravity on spatial orientation: an eye movement study</title> <abstract>Spatial orientation is a fundamental subject in aviation psychology. The influence of representational gravity can lead to systematic errors during uniform linear motion. However, it remains unclear whether representational gravity during motion can affect spatial orientation. In this study, college students from Xi’an, China were recruited to participate in an experiment based on the Spatial Visualization Dynamic Test. We compared the accuracy of spatial orientation estimation and eye movement indices when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the lower right versus when it was in the upper right. The results revealed that individuals were prone to overestimate the adjustment angle when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the lower right, and underestimate the adjustment angle when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the upper right; the average pupil size was significantly larger when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the lower right than that when the main direction of spatial orientation was in the upper right. In conclusion, spatial orientation in motion was influenced by representational gravity, and when representational gravity aligned with the main direction of spatial orientation, it led to increased cognitive resource consumption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.</abstract>"

Trained nurses possessing flight nurse proficiency are indispensable for ensuring stable patient conditions amidst the unique physical, physiological, and psychological challenges encountered during flights. Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of nurses and air ambulance service providers regarding aeromedical evacuations. Methods: This study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Data were gathered from February to July 2023 through semi-structured online interviews with seven nurses and air ambulance service providers engaged in aeromedical evacuation. Content analysis was utilized to interpret the interview data. Results: Seven themes were generated: 1) Experiences in aeromedical evacuation experiences, 2) Challenges faced by nurses and air ambulance service providers during aeromedical evacuations, 3) Essential knowledge for nurses involved in aeromedical evacuations, 4) Efforts to improve nurses’ knowledge and skills, 5) Leveling of flight nurse training, 6) Flight nurse training methods, and 7) Flight nurse training evaluation strategies. Conclusion: Nurses and air ambulance service providers acknowledge the significant influence of the flight environment on changes in patient conditions during aeromedical evacuations. To effectively manage alterations in patient conditions during flights, healthcare workers equipped with aviation health competency are imperative. One approach to enhancing the competency of healthcare workers is through flight nurse training.

2024,Greece - United Kingdom,"A comparative analysis of job satisfaction among military and airline pilots: During, and post COVID-19","<title>A comparative analysis of job satisfaction among military and airline pilots: During, and post COVID-19</title> <abstract>This research aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Job Satisfaction of military and airline pilots, in order to identify factors that influence the sustainability of aviation operations during global economic shocks, through the prism of industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology. The primary focus was on identifying factors linked to pilots' Job Satisfaction differentiations over the time course of the pandemic, and proposing measures to mitigate their negative effects. Survey Job Satisfaction data were collected from 203 pilots during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2021, and were subsequently measured in a quasi-identical sample of 205 pilots after the pandemic in May 2023. During the pandemic, the results indicate that airline pilots experienced an acute decrease in Job Satisfaction due to the disruptive nature of COVID-19. This decline was primarily attributed to factors such as pay cuts and reduced promotion prospects, which consequently resulted in feelings of limited job security and future uncertainty. Importantly, a substantial recovery of airline pilots JS was observed following the end of the pandemic. In contrast, military pilots' levels remained relatively constant over the duration of the pandemic, as military organizations typically received government provided financial security. To improve commercial sustainability, it is recommended that airline companies enhance their preparedness for future crises by minimizing the financial impact experienced by pilots. Additionally, effective communication strategies should be implemented to address and alleviate uncertainty among pilots. It is crucial to prevent adverse psychological conditions among pilots, as they play a critical role in maintaining flight safety. © 2024 The Authors</abstract>"

Six job stressors were identified through a literature review and focus group interviews. To determine the causal relationships, a survey was conducted from February 8 to April 9, 2022, targeting Korean cabin crew members in Middle Eastern airlines. A total of 201 valid samples were used for the statistical analysis. The findings revealed that flight attendants' job stress negatively impacts their mental health, while mental health deterioration positively impacts service sabotage behavior. Job insecurity, vertical communication, and acculturation stress negatively impacts flight attendants' mental health. The findings indicate that mental health deterioration is important in mediating the relationship between job stress and service sabotage. Finally, it is confirmed that there are differences in job stress, mental health deterioration, and service sabotage based on various demographic and occupational characteristics. This study is noteworthy because it approaches the dependent variable of job stress from the perspective of employees’ mental health rather than job-related variables. Service sabotage is introduced as a new variable because this behavior by flight attendants, whose primary job is to interact with customers, can have serious consequences for airline organizations and customers alike. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2024,Spain,EEG Dataset Collection for Mental Workload Predictions in Flight-Deck Environment,"<title>EEG Dataset Collection for Mental Workload Predictions in Flight-Deck Environment</title> <abstract>High mental workload reduces human performance and the ability to correctly carry out complex tasks. In particular, aircraft pilots enduring high mental workloads are at high risk of failure, even with catastrophic outcomes. Despite progress, there is still a lack of knowledge about the interrelationship between mental workload and brain functionality, and there is still limited data on flight-deck scenarios. Although recent emerging deep-learning (DL) methods using physiological data have presented new ways to find new physiological markers to detect and assess cognitive states, they demand large amounts of properly annotated datasets to achieve good performance. We present a new dataset of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings specifically collected for the recognition of different levels of mental workload. The data were recorded from three experiments, where participants were induced to different levels of workload through tasks of increasing cognition demand. The first involved playing the N-back test, which combines memory recall with arithmetical skills. The second was playing Heat-the-Chair, a serious game specifically designed to emphasize and monitor subjects under controlled concurrent tasks. The third was flying in an Airbus320 simulator and solving several critical situations. The design of the dataset has been validated on three different levels: (1) correlation of the theoretical difficulty of each scenario to the self-perceived difficulty and performance of subjects; (2) significant difference in EEG temporal patterns across the theoretical difficulties and (3) usefulness for the training and evaluation of AI models. © 2024 by the authors.</abstract>"

2024,Greece,The effects of increased mental workload of air traffic controllers on time perception: Behavioral and physiological evidence,"<title>The effects of increased mental workload of air traffic controllers on time perception: Behavioral and physiological evidence</title> <abstract>Research has shown that timing is modulated by mental workload, making duration judgments a measure of cognitive demand, alongside subjective assessments, and physiological measurements. Yet, it is unclear whether such findings can be extended in less controlled setups. By employing air traffic controllers in a real aviation environment, we tested whether tasks with different levels of cognitive load can affect their timing behavior. Participants completed temporal production, verbal estimation, and passage of time judgments, while actively engaging in real flight control sessions. Subjective assessments of task demands, as well as physiological responses (cardiac and electrodermal activity) were also measured. Accuracy of the produced intervals was measured at two distinct phases of the flight (during low-load cruising vs. high-load landing) and under two different task load manipulations (controlling one vs. two helicopters and speaking in native vs. non-native language). Analysis of interval production accuracy showed that during the high-load landing phase significant overproductions were made, compared to the low-load cruising phase, and landing two helicopters led to greater overproductions compared to landing only one. The duration of the two-helicopter sessions was significantly overestimated compared to the single-helicopter ones, and the passage of time was felt significantly faster. Subjective assessments of workload were positively correlated with the temporal estimations and passage of time judgments, and skin responses were positively correlated with the produced intervals. Overall, our results are consistent with past research, suggesting that mental workload modulates time perception in complex, real-world environments, thus making timing behavior a reliable index of the workload changes. © 2023 The Authors</abstract>"
2024,Serbia,Occupational risk factors for sleep quality among Serbian airline pilots,"<title>Occupational risk factors for sleep quality among Serbian airline pilots</title> <abstract>Introduction: The ability of airline pilots to maintain a good level of sleep goes a long way in ensuring operational effectiveness with regard to safety as well as personal health. The study assesses the risk factors for sleep quality of airline pilots in Serbia with the objective of determining those factors, both occupational and lifestyle that are paramount in assisting with sleep health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 66 Serbian commercial pilots, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess their sleep quality. Demographic, occupational, lifestyle, biological and psychological variables were obtained through validated questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥5). Results: Overall sleep quality was poor in 65.2% of the participants. Significant factors associated with poor sleep quality included years of experience (OR = 1.17, p = 0.007) and levels of stress (OR = 2.87, p = 0.004). Particular lifestyle variables, including factors such as coffee intake, had initial relationships with sleep quality but were not significant in the multivariate models. With regard to age, a significant univariate association was also revealed but was dropped in the final model because of collinearity with years of experience. Conclusion: Serbian commercial pilots have a relatively high risk of inadequate sleep associated with years of experience and levels of stress. There is a need to implement organization-wide changes such as stress management schemes in order to improve sleep quality among pilots, and foster prioritizing well-being. © © 2025 Stojanović, Nesic, Maksimović, Terzić-Šupić, Todorović, Topalović, Vlaisavljević and Ilić Živojinović.</abstract>"
2024,Indonesia,Flight Hours and Depression in Flight Attendants During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"<title>Flight Hours and Depression in Flight Attendants During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Flight attendants are constantly exposed to high-stress environments that could lead to the development of depression. The COVID-19 pandemic brought out new risk factors that could affect flight attendants’ mental health, such as reduced flight hours and fear of the disease itself, which other studies have shown was associated with depression. We aimed to find out whether reduced flight hours, fear of COVID-19, and other factors were associated with depression in flight attendants during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: T his cross-sectional study was conducted at the Directorate General Civil Aviation Medical Center Indonesia and Garuda Sentra Medika in 2022. We included flight attendants who were still employed before and after the start of the pandemic. Data were collected using several questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire-12 to screen for depression and Fear of COVID-19 for fear levels. RESULTS: We obtained data from 159 respondents, of whom 25.2% of them had depression. Multivariate analysis showed that the reduction of flight hours 1 yr after the start of the pandemic and fear of COVID-19 were found to significantly increase the likelihood of depression by 2.3 times and 3.9 times, respectively. DISCUSSION: During the pandemic, depression was found to be highly prevalent among flight attendants and was associated with the reduction of flight hours and fear of COVID-19. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2024,Australia,Underreporting of Depression in Australian Commercial Pilots,"<title>Underreporting of Depression in Australian Commercial Pilots</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Undiagnosed depression in the aviation industry can have catastrophic consequences such as aircraft-assisted suicide. Depression is often underreported, especially when subjects are aware they are reporting on depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether scores on a depression screening tool would vary if it was disguised as a “life stress” questionnaire in a sample of Australian commercial pilots. METHODS: A total of 109 subjects were assigned into either a “Life Stress” survey or a “Depression” survey, both containing the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales depression screening tool among other questions relating to either depression or stress to determine any variation in depression scores. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in which the covert group that completed a “life-stress” survey scored higher average depression scores than the control group completing an overt depression inventory. Prevalence of depression was consistent with the general population, with 25% of pilots meeting the threshold for depression within the control group, and this number increased to 41% when using a covert measure to assess depression. DISCUSSION: T his research adds further weight to the potential underreporting of depression in pilots as a function of stigma and fear associated with the label “depression”. Regulators and organizations must proactively minimize exposure to psychological harm, negating the reliance on self-reporting to control psychological risk and recruitment methods must aim to reduce bias against those with disabilities. Nonpunitive environments for pilots to self-assess and report psychological issues will allow better outcomes from expedited treatment. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

This qualitative semi-structured interview study examined the perceived triggering factors and motivations for DPB and the subsequent impact of DPB upon cabin crew well-being and safety. Twenty-four European cabin crew disclosed experiences, subjective observations of perpetrator traits, assessment of DPB development and information regarding their well-being and perceived safety. Thematic analysis revealed that the perceived frequency of DPB had increased, driven by an accumulation of pandemic-related factors–such as enforcing mask wearing amongst intoxicated passengers. DPB was found to decrease resilience and spur maladaptive coping strategies in crew. Suggested enhancements to current DPB mitigation consisted of stricter punishment for DPB as a deterrent, alcohol bans and higher quality training. These findings can inform decision-makers’ efforts to support cabin crew well-being and create safer cabin workplaces in the future. © 2024 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

As part of a diverse European Space Agency funded Topical Team, we are working on the physiological feasibility of space missions being undertaken by people with physical disabilities. Here, the first activity of this team is presented in the form of key lessons learned from aviation to inform new work on space missions. DISCUSSION: The first lesson is agreeing on realistic expectations about impairments, their severity, and the possibility of flying independently. This is important in terms of astronaut recruitment and societal expectations. The second lesson relates to training and adjustments for people with disabilities. Flexibility is important while maintaining safety for everyone involved. The third lesson is about managing unconscious bias from the different stakeholders. We conclude by arguing that engagement with people from different backgrounds is essential for the success of the first space mission with people with physical disabilities. © by The Authors.</abstract>"
2024,Japan,Upregulation of Amy1 in the salivary glands of mice exposed to a lunar gravity environment using the multiple artificial gravity research system,"<title>Upregulation of Amy1 in the salivary glands of mice exposed to a lunar gravity environment using the multiple artificial gravity research system</title> <abstract>Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment. © © 2024 Ouchi, Kono, Satou, Kurashima, Yamaguchi, Kimura and Shibukawa.</abstract>"

Methods: Data were collected through a 2022 survey of Korean flight attendants, yielding 297 responses. Model reliability and validity were assessed to confirm hypotheses. Results: Hope had a significant negative effect on turnover intention P<0.05), whereas optimism and resilience did not have significant effects on turnover intention. Additionally, hope had a significant positive effect on normative and continuance commitment, unlike optimism and resilience, which did not have significant effects on normative commitment or continuance commitment. Both normative commitment and continuance commitment negatively influenced turnover intention. Organizational commitment mediated the relationship between psychological capital and turnover intention, reinforcing the positive impact of psychological capital on reducing turnover intention. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of psychological capital in shaping organizational commitment and reducing turnover intention among Korean flight attendants. Strengthening psychological capital and fostering organizational commitment can bolster airline stability, competitiveness, and service quality. © 2024 Han et al.</abstract>"
2024,United Kingdom,Practice effects of a breathing technique on pilots’ cognitive and stress associated heart rate variability during flight operations,"<title>Practice effects of a breathing technique on pilots’ cognitive and stress associated heart rate variability during flight operations</title> <abstract>Commercial pilots endure multiple stressors in their daily and occupational lives which are detrimental to psychological well-being and cognitive functioning. The Quick coherence technique (QCT) is an effective intervention tool to improve stress resilience and psychophysiological balance based on a five-minute paced breathing exercise with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback. The current research reports on the application of QCT training within an international airline to improve commercial pilots’ psychological health and support cognitive functions. Forty-four commercial pilots volunteered in a one-month training programme to practise self-regulated QCT in day-to-day life and flight operations. Pilots’ stress index, HRV time-domain and frequency-domain parameters were collected to examine the influence of QCT practice on the stress resilience process. The results demonstrated that the QCT improved psychophysiological indicators associated with stress resilience and cognitive functions, in both day-to-day life and flight operation settings. HRV fluctuations, as measured through changes in RMSSD and LF/HF, revealed that the resilience processes were primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activities that are important in promoting pilots’ energy mobilization and cognitive functions, thus QCT has huge potential in facilitating flight performance and aviation safety. These findings provide scientific evidence for implementing QCT as an effective mental support programme and controlled rest strategy to improve pilots’ psychological health, stress management, and operational performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

2024,India,Air India pee gate case – need for comprehensive SOPs in customer management,"<title>Air India pee gate case – need for comprehensive SOPs in customer management</title> <abstract>Learning outcomes: This case study allows students to appreciate the value of standard operating procedures in customer management. This case study emphasises the role of employees in delivering superior customer experience. This case study explores many facets of customer experience, reputation, social class membership and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Students will be able to apply theories of customer experience, behavioural psychology and service dimensions relevant to the airline industry. After completing this case study, students will be able to do the following:1. Evaluate the value of SOPs in Customer ManagementThis case study refers to the need for adhering to SOPs to deal with complex situations. Students will be able to evaluate whether compliance to SOPs could have helped Air India avoid the crisis or was it possible that a culture of absolute commitment to customer wellbeing could have prevented the crisis.2. Apply the theory of defensive attribution in customer grievance handling. Discuss if reducing customer effort in getting their problem solved can result in superior customer service.The victim had attributed the blame for not insisting on filing a complaint to the crew. Air India crew had defended their actions or lack of it by stating that they had followed the rule book. Students will be able to appreciate the need for a swift redressal mechanism to protect the self-image and self-esteem of the person/group involved. They will also understand that customer service interactions designed to solve customer problems swiftly and easily can be a very simple dictum to guide all employees in their decision-making while handling a customer complaint. 3. Evaluate the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer experience and examine the value of net promoter score (NPS) to study customer satisfaction. Air India Airlines was catering to varied customer groups such as the Indian diaspora, large student population pursuing education abroad, first-time flyers and the rising middle class with travel aspirations. Customer expectations vary across segments and change over their lifetime. Airline staff must trace customer corridors and deliver on customer expectation across the touch points that matter to them to ensure meaningful and relevant service delivery. Students will have an opportunity to evaluate the NPS in measuring customer satisfaction and debate whether it is a sufficient metric to guide the organisation on delivering and monitoring customer experience. 4. Examine why reputation risk management and not crisis management should be the focus of Air India in delivering superior customer service because nearly 70%–80% of market value for a company comes from its intangible assets such as brand equity and reputation. Students will discuss crisis management i.e. handling the threat to reputation after it has occurred and reputation risk management i.e. proactively managing potential threats to its reputation by taking timely actions to avoid or mitigate it. There are three factors (reputation reality gap, changing beliefs and expectation and weak internal coordination) that determine reputational risks. Students can evaluate this model to determine if Air India should address these three factors to manage its reputation proactively. Case overview/synopsis: This case study is set around an incident that happened on 26 November 2022, on Air India flight bound for Delhi from New York when an inebriated 34-year-old man had peed on a 72-year-old woman. The perpetrator of the crime had walked free, and the victim was left dissatisfied with how the cabin crew had handled her ordeal. Air India Airlines was launched in 1932 by industrialist JRD Tata and nationalised in 1953. In 2021, Tata Group acquired the 90-year-old Air India from the Government of India for $2.4bn (INR 18,000 crore) and appointed Campbell Wilson as chief executive officer and managing director. The incident brought to the fore the customer management issues that Wilson had to address. First on the list of Air India’s turnaround plan was delivering “exceptional customer experience”. How was it going to achieve it because the Indian aviation ecosystem lacked infrastructure such as airports, airspace, competition and customer preference-based services? There was also shortage of pilots, engineers, technicians, air-traffic controllers and technocrats to occupy positions within security agencies and regulatory bodies. With Air India’s acquisition, the Tata Group had to find innovative solutions to deal with decades of internal neglect, non-performance and labour union problems. This case study is relevant to address real issues of customer experience, consumer psychology, reputation risk management and standard operating procedures in service management. Complexity academic level: This case is suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate level students of business management. It can also be used for training service personnel of aviation industry. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

2024,China - Japan,Challenges and support needs in psychological and physical health among pilots: a qualitative study,"<title>Challenges and support needs in psychological and physical health among pilots: a qualitative study</title> <abstract>Introduction: Physical and mental health problems among pilots affect their working state and impact flight safety. Although pilots’ physical and mental health problems have become increasingly prominent, their health has not been taken seriously. This study aimed to clarify challenges and support needs related to psychological and physical health among pilots to inform development of a more scientific and comprehensive physical and mental health system for civil aviation pilots. Methods: This qualitative study recruited pilots from nine civil aviation companies. Focus group interviews via an online conference platform were conducted in August 2022. Colaizzi analysis was used to derive themes from the data and explore pilots’ experiences, challenges, and support needs. Results: The main sub-themes capturing pilots’ psychological and physical health challenges were: (1) imbalance between family life and work; (2) pressure from assessment and physical examination eligibility requirements; (3) pressure from worries about being infected with COVID-19; (4) nutrition deficiency during working hours; (5) changes in eating habits because of the COVID-19 pandemic; (6) sleep deprivation; (7) occupational diseases; (8) lack of support from the company in coping with stress; (9) pilots’ yearly examination standards; (10) support with sports equipment; (11) respecting planned rest time; and (12) isolation periods. Discussion: The interviewed pilots experienced major psychological pressure from various sources, and their physical health condition was concerning. We offer several suggestions that could be addressed to improve pilots’ physical and mental health. However, more research is needed to compare standard health measures for pilots around the world in order to improve their physical and mental health and contribute to overall aviation safety. © © 2024 Xu, Bao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Li, Jin, Chen, Duan, Shi, Wang, Lu, Chen, Gao, Han, Ren, Su and Xiang.</abstract>"
2024,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",The Impact of Psychological Capital and Organizational Justice on Flight attendants’ Performance: The Mediating Role of Mental Health,"<title>The Impact of Psychological Capital and Organizational Justice on Flight attendants’ Performance: The Mediating Role of Mental Health</title> <abstract>Purpose: This paper proposes a research model in which mental health mediates the impacts of psychological capital (PsyCap) and organizational justice on flight attendant job performance based on the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory. Background: Flight attendants in the airline industry have a differentiated work environment in stressful and demanding situations. The literature has highlighted the prevalence of mental health disorders among flight attendants. Methods: Non-experimental, quantitative research findings from a sample of 384 flight attendants from five airlines in Iran, based on structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, provide support for the hypotheses. Results: The SEM findings revealed that both PsyCap and organizational justice can enhance flight attendant mental health. As expected, mental health improved job performance. Consistent with the study’s predictions, mental health mediated the effects of PsyCap and organizational justice on job performance. Conclusions: This study empirically linked PsyCap and organizational justice to flight attendant perceptions of mental health and job performance. The research findings support the notion that strengthening flight attendant PsyCap and enhancing perceptions of organizational justice can improve performance by improving mental health. These findings have theoretical and practical implications. This research contributes to the extant literature by empirically validating the mediating effect of mental health and clarifying the role of two types of individual psychological job resources on flight attendant performance. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Analysis of safety resilience in flight operations during COVID-19 disruptions,"<title>What can we learn from severity index on flight data monitoring? Analysis of safety resilience in flight operations during COVID-19 disruptions</title> <abstract>The unexpected spread of the pandemic raised concerns regarding pilots’ skill decay resulting from the significant drops in the frequency of flights by about 70%. This research retrieved 4761 Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) occurrences based on the FDM programme containing 123,140 flights operated by an international airline between June 2019 and May 2021. The FDM severity index was analysed by event category, aircraft type, and flight phase. The results demonstrate an increase in severity score from the pre-pandemic level to the pandemic onset on events that occurred on different flight phases. This trend is not present in the third stage, which indicates that pilots and the safety management system of the airline demonstrated resilience to cope with the flight disruptions during the pandemic. Through the analysis of event severity, FDM enables safety managers to recommend measures to increase safety resilience and self-monitoring capabilities of both operators and regulators. Practitioner summary: The onset of the pandemic led to a rise in the severity of flight data monitoring events in a large airline, likely linked to a lack of operational practice and skills decay. This was demonstrated across different flight phases and aircraft types. In the settled pandemic period, the severity index returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the resilience of individual pilots and safety management systems is critical to operational safety.HIGHLIGHTS The FDM event severity scores significantly increased following the pandemic onset, especially for event categories involving pilot core competencies. The FDM event severity scores stagnated or decreased during the later pandemic stage indicating resilience among the airline pilots and the airline’s safety management system. The airline and pilots demonstrated resilience by effectively mitigating the effects of proficiency decay which took place as the pandemic started. FDM analysis has shown to be effective in establishing a proactive SMS programme to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on aviation safety. © 2023 The Author(s).

2024,Australia - China - Hong Kong - Macao,The Association of Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality With Depression and Anxiety Among Chinese Commercial Pilots,"<title>The Association of Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality With Depression and Anxiety Among Chinese Commercial Pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Sleep problems are known as risk factors for depression and anxiety, but research on this subject with commercial pilots is limited. This study aimed to explore the effects of sleep problems on depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese commercial pilots. Methods: Adults who participated in the baseline assessment of the Civil Aviation Health Cohort of China between December 2022 and March 2023 formed the study sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep quality were assessed using standardized scales. Sleep duration was measured with standardized questions. Logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to analyze the association between sleep problems and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 7055 pilots were included in this study. The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety among pilots was 23.3% (n = 1642; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.3%–24.3%) and 17.0% (n = 1196; 95% CI = 16.1–17.8%), respectively. Logistic regression analyses revealed that short sleep duration (<7 h) was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.491; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 2.555; p < 0.001), while poor sleep quality was also associated with a higher risk of depression (OR = 7.297; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 7.469; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, there was an inverse, J-shaped nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and both depression (inflection point: 7.64 h) and anxiety (inflection point: 7.48 h). Similarly, a J-shaped nonlinear relationship was found between sleep quality and depression/anxiety with an inflection point of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) = 4 points for both. The major limitation of the study was that causal relationships between variables could not be inferred due to the cross-sectional study design. Conclusion: This study found that depression and anxiety were common among Chinese commercial pilots. Insufficient length and poor quality of sleep were associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Implementing targeted strategies to improve sleep patterns is crucial for reducing the risk of depression and anxiety in this population. © © 2024 Pan Chen et al.</abstract>"

Thus, understanding the intentions and the characteristics of future space travelers is crucial. (2) Methods: Here, we validated the brief 11-item Space Tourism Propensity Questionnaire (STP-Q) and administered it, along with sociodemographic and psychological questionnaires, to 333 undergraduates in order to explore ST propensity and predictive factors. (3) Results: Linear regression analysis revealed that STP-Q scores are influenced by personality traits, particularly sensation seeking, social distance, and conscientiousness. Sensation seeking predicts the intention to engage in future space travel, while trait anxiety negatively impacts it. Surprisingly, neither sociodemographic features nor pro-environmental behaviors predict ST propensity, as expected. (4) Conclusions: The STP-Q is a cost-effective self-report for assessing ST propensity and can contribute to the evolving field of space tourism when used in combination with other questionnaires. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>"
2023,United States,Using machine learning methods and EEG to discriminate aircraft pilot cognitive workload during flight,"<title>Using machine learning methods and EEG to discriminate aircraft pilot cognitive workload during flight</title> <abstract>Pilots of aircraft face varying degrees of cognitive workload even during normal flight operations. Periods of low cognitive workload may be followed by periods of high cognitive workload and vice versa. During such changing demands, there exists potential for increased error on behalf of the pilots due to periods of boredom or excessive cognitive task demand. To further understand cognitive workload in aviation, the present study involved collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data from ten (10) collegiate aviation students in a live-flight environment in a single-engine aircraft. Each pilot possessed a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate and either FAA class I or class II medical certificate. Each pilot flew a standardized flight profile representing an average instrument flight training sequence. For data analysis, we used four main sub-bands of the recorded EEG signals: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Power spectral density (PSD) and log energy entropy of each sub-band across 20 electrodes were computed and subjected to two feature selection algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE) and lasso cross-validation (LassoCV), and a stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm composed of support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Also, hyperparameter optimization and tenfold cross-validation were used to improve the model performance, reliability, and generalization. The feature selection step resulted in 15 features that can be considered an indicator of pilots' cognitive workload states. Then these features were applied to the stacking ensemble algorithm, and the highest results were achieved using the selected features by the RFE algorithm with an accuracy of 91.67% (± 0.11), a precision of 93.89% (± 0.09), recall of 91.67% (± 0.11), F-score of 91.22% (± 0.12), and the mean ROC-AUC of 0.93 (± 0.06). The achieved results indicated that the combination of PSD and log energy entropy, along with well-designed machine learning algorithms, suggest the potential for the use of EEG to discriminate periods of the low, medium, and high workload to augment aircraft system design, including flight automation features to improve aviation safety. © 2023, The Author(s).</abstract>"
2023,China,Analysis on coupling dynamic effect of human errors in aviation safety,"<title>Analysis on coupling dynamic effect of human errors in aviation safety</title> <abstract>Human factors have increasingly been the leading cause of aircraft accidents. In most cases, human factors are not working alone, instead they are coupled with complex environment, mechanical factors, physiological and psychological factors of pilots, and organizational management, all of which form a complex aviation safety system. It is vital to investigate the coupling impact of human errors to avoid the occurrence of aviation accidents. In view that the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) provides a hierarchical classification principle of human errors in aviation accidents, and the System Dynamics (SD) approach is helpful to describe the risk evolution process, this paper establishes a hybrid HFACS-SD model by employing the HFACS and the SD approach to reveal the aviation human factors risk evolution mechanism, in which the HFACS is first used to capture the causal factors of human errors risk, and a coupling SD model is then built to describe the evolution of aviation human factors risk supported by historical data. The eigenvalue elasticity analysis is taken to identify critical loops and parameters that have a substantial impact on the system structural behavior, and the influence of parameters and loops is assessed. Simulation results show that the evolution trend of the accident rate can be replicated by the proposed HFACS-SD model, and the structural dominance analysis can efficiently identify critical loops and parameters. Simulation results further show that, with the recommended safety enhancement measures, the stability of the aviation system is increased, and thus lowering the overall accident rate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2023,Germany,"The ""Digital Other"": Self-Objectification and Narration in Contemporary Fiction","<title>The ""Digital Other"": Self-Objectification and Narration in Contemporary Fiction</title> <abstract>The ""digital Other"" is a useful description for a phenomenon we often face in contemporary literature. Many characters act as if an invisible observer is judging them, even when they are alone or in an intimate situation. They continuously undergo acts of self-objectification, which require an optical medium, like a camera shot. The ""Other"" who holds the camera has no physical presence in the story but a psychological presence in the character's mind. I call this internalized authority the ""digital Other,"" and it refers to today's omnipresent digital visual media. The power of the digital Other could be compared to the power the air has from the perspective of an aircraft pilot. Even though the air cannot be seen or touched, it moves the plane and forces its pilot to react to it. The internalized idea of an invisible observer has the same effect on literary figures. It makes them not only decide what to wear or say but also whom they are allowed to regard as desirable and how they should perform their sexuality. Hans-Georg Moeller and Paul J. D'Ambrosio claim that nowadays having an identity feels like presenting yourself through a social media profile, and the digital Other can be described as an agent supporting this profile-based identity. The burden of permanent self-objectification also has an impact on modes of literary narration. The digital Other entails a remarkable connection of internal and external focalizations. Literary voices seem to simultaneously describe actions both from internal and external points of view. The narrative voice sounds odd because it is subjective and yet inauthentic. Through this bizarre voice, characters are staged as objects even when they are presented through first-person narration. The narrative voice presents an imaged, idealized ego, a mode of self-presentation that obeys the digital Other. © 2023 National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

A cross-sectional descriptive design was used and the participants were 89 ATC in Makassar Air Traffic Service Center. The data collected included the general characteristics of ATC, DASS-21, KAUPK2, and (WHOQOL)-BREF. Data were collected from February to March 2022, then analysis was carried out using SPSS and Excel software. The results indicated the presence of negative emotional conditions among ATC even outside of their normal traffic control duties. Approximately 24% of ATC reported feelings of fatigue, while the quality of life exhibited a wide distribution of data, ranging from moderate to low. Therefore, it was concluded that the health status of ATC, even with regulations limiting the amount of traffic related to the pandemic period, still needs special attention to maintain performance. © 2023 by author.</abstract>"
2023,Spain,CRM: Development of Pending Critical Aspects; CRM: Desarrollo de Aspectos Críticos Pendientes,"<title>CRM: Development of Pending Critical Aspects; CRM: Desarrollo de Aspectos Críticos Pendientes</title> <abstract>The evolution of CRM programs has meant enormous progress for aviation in terms of the study of human factors and their relationship with the reduction of air accidents. Although it is true that CRM programs have undergone a successful evolution since their appearance in 1979, it is also true that the advances in psychological science in recent decades make it necessary to review and expand on aspects already addressed in previous stages by these programs. One of these aspects is the importance of the cabin crew members (CCM) as members of the flight team. Going back to the third generation programs, this paper analyzes the actions that the CCM have taken in different air accidents, highlighting the importance of their performance and their coordination with the rest of the crew in order to achieve success in resolving the air emergency. © 2023, Colegio Oficial de Psicologos.

2023,Canada - United Kingdom - United States,Crew Autonomy During Simulated Medical Event Management on Long Duration Space Exploration Missions,"<title>Crew Autonomy During Simulated Medical Event Management on Long Duration Space Exploration Missions</title> <abstract>Objective: Our primary aim was to investigate crew performance during medical emergencies with and without ground-support from a flight surgeon located at mission control. Background: There are gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success. Additionally, ground support may be impaired or periodically absent during long duration missions. Method: We reviewed video recordings of 16 three-person flight crews each managing four unique medical events in a fully immersive spacecraft simulator. Crews were randomized to two conditions: with and without telemedical flight surgeon (FS) support. We assessed differences in technical performance, behavioral skills, and cognitive load between groups. Results: Crews with FS support performed better clinically, were rated higher on technical skills, and completed more clinical tasks from the medical checklists than crews without FS support. Crews with FS support also had better behavioral/non-technical skills (information exchange) and reported significantly lower cognitive demand during the medical event scenarios on the NASA-TLX scale, particularly in mental demand and temporal demand. There was no significant difference between groups in time to treat or in objective measures of cognitive demand derived from heart rate variability and electroencephalography. Conclusion: Medical checklists are necessary but not sufficient to support high levels of autonomous crew performance in the absence of real-time flight surgeon support Application: Potential applications of this research include developing ground-based and in-flight training countermeasures; informing policy regarding autonomous spaceflight, and design of autonomous clinical decision support systems. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract>"
2023,Australia,Simulation of aircraft multi-axis acceleration in a four-axis Human Centrifuge System,"<title>Simulation of aircraft multi-axis acceleration in a four-axis Human Centrifuge System</title> <abstract>High G-accelerations produced during Aircraft Combat Manoeuvres (ACMs) can adversely affect the physiological and psychological conditions of aircrew and deteriorate their performance. Human Centrifuge Systems (HCSs) provide an effective G-acceleration training tool to prepare and increase the G-tolerance of aircrew. Though highly capable HCSs are available, they are yet to be fully optimised to accurately and reliably recreate the G-vectors produced by ACMs. Optimisation steps to achieve this improvement involve the configurational structure, motion capability, and motion control of HCSs. To improve the motion capability and control of HCSs, the relationship between aircraft G-vectors and HCS G-vectors should be profoundly investigated. This work analyses the G-vectors of common ACMs and the corresponding G-vectors as well as kinematics of an active four Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) HCS. The mathematical models of an aircraft and HCS kinematics are developed using rigid body equations of motion through Newton-Euler method. The relationship between aircraft G-vectors and HCS G-vectors is established using inverse kinematics with an optimal solver. The outcomes of this study show that an active four-DoF HCS with gondola roll, pitch, and yaw rotation can replicate the G-vectors of common ACMs with small discrepancies. The largest error between the reference and achieved G-vectors occurred along the local z-axis of the HCS gondola during the transition of roll, pitch, and yaw motions of the gondola to the required angle replicating the G-vectors of the ACMs. The tracing errors are not significant; hence they can be mitigated with an optimal control technique. The presented outcomes will provide an essential step in identifying the optimal design and refined requirements for an HCS to efficiently replicate aircraft G-vectors. The applied methodology is easily adaptable to HCS with different structures and DoFs. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract>"
2023,China,Effects of age and flight exposure on flight safety performance: Evidence from a large cross-sectional pilot sample,"<title>Effects of age and flight exposure on flight safety performance: Evidence from a large cross-sectional pilot sample</title> <abstract>Generally, flight experience protects against the effect of the normal aging process on pilots’ incident involvement, but some studies have shown a negative effect of flight hours on flight safety performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between age, flight exposure, and flight safety performance in a large cross-sectional sample of commercial airline pilots (N = 1291). We examined the role that flight exposure plays in mediating age and flight safety performance, as well as the role that age plays in moderating flight exposure and flight safety performance in different age groups. Pilots’ age, total flight hours of B737-800, and exceedance data from 2016 to 2018 were collected. The results showed that exceedance rates increased rapidly among pilots aged 21–40, regardless of their flight exposure levels. In addition, flight exposure mediated the association between age and exceedance rates among pilots aged 21–35; age moderated the association between flight exposure and exceedance rates among pilots aged 26–35. Age directly affected exceedance rates among pilots aged 41–45 and 56–60. These findings provide insights into the pilots’ psychological and cognitive competencies in the professionalism lifecycle management perspective, which has previously been confused between age and flight exposure. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2023,United States,Examining the Future of Automation in Commercialized Flight and its Impact on Airline Pilots,"<title>Examining the Future of Automation in Commercialized Flight and its Impact on Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>The purpose of this study was to focus on the perceptions of an automated (unmanned) flight deck and its intended implementation in the U.S. airline industry. The objective was to understand fully autonomous aircraft’s influence on commercial pilots, as well as investigate the effects on the U.S. airline industry and human-machine interaction. Commercial airline pilots, including ranks of both Captains and First Officers (FO) in Part 121 scheduled service, were the research population for this study. The sample population number was 15 U.S. airline pilots offering various diversity in age, gender, years of service, airline employer, and military or civilian flight experience. The semi-structured qualitative research consisted of developing a deeper understanding of the pilots’ perceptions of the three-pronged approach: (1) the psychological barriers and motives of the pilot, (2) the differences in aircraft ground-based safety and training, and (3) pilots’ understanding of the timeliness of entry for unmanned flight deck operations to reach FAA standards. The study consisted of participant interviews utilizing a series of ten structured and semi-structured interview questions. The findings concluded that pilots are aware of the workload changes that are present with implementing fully autonomous aircraft in the Part 121 category. Two themes became evident when discussing workload changes. First, the role of the pilot changes from a single flight focus to a multi-flight monitor. Secondly, as technology advances, the pilot’s physical workload of hand flying an aircraft will constantly deteriorate. Furthermore, the advancement of a fully automated flight deck and its effects on the U.S. airline industry can potentially have significant impacts on the psychology of commercial airline pilots. While pilot responses varied based on individual experiences, attitudes, and adaptability, there were several psychological responses identified in this study, including (1) loss of control, (2) uncertainty toward technology, (3) job insecurity, and (4) adaptability. Last, the advancement of a fully autonomous flight deck will obviously create additional concerns for U.S. airline passengers. The most significant concerns for passengers included (1) safety, (2) trust, (3) passenger-pilot relationship, and (4) understanding of technology. Passengers will always question if modern technology has been thoroughly evaluated and if it can react to unexpected situations as safely and effectively as a human. © 2023, University Aviation Association.

2023,United States,Air traffic controller workload level prediction using conformalized dynamical graph learning,"<title>Air traffic controller workload level prediction using conformalized dynamical graph learning</title> <abstract>Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical service system that demands constant attention from ground air traffic controllers (ATCos) to maintain daily aviation operations. The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos’ workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller's control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels.

2023,China,Bifurcation Analysis of Improved Traffic Flow Model on Curved Road,"<title>Bifurcation Analysis of Improved Traffic Flow Model on Curved Road</title> <abstract>Nonlinear analysis of complex traffic flow systems can provide a deep understanding of the causes of various traffic phenomena and reduce traffic congestion, and bifurcation analysis is a powerful method for it. In this paper, based on the improved Aw–Rascle model, a new macroscopic traffic flow model is proposed, which takes into account the road factors and driver psychological factor in the curve environment which can effectively simulate many realistic traffic phenomena on curves. The macroscopic traffic flow model on curved road is analyzed by bifurcation, first, it is transformed into a nonlinear dynamical system, then its stability conditions and the existence conditions of bifurcations are derived, and the changes of trajectories near the equilibrium points are described by phase plane. From an equilibrium point, various bifurcation structures describing the nonlinear traffic flow are obtained. In this paper, the influence of different bifurcations on traffic flow is analyzed, and the causes of special traffic phenomena such as stop-and-go and traffic clustering are described using Hopf bifurcation as the starting point of density temporal evolution. The derivation and simulation show that both road factors and driver psychological factor affect the stability of traffic flow on curves, and the study of bifurcation in the curved traffic flow model provides decision support for traffic management. © © 2023 by ASME.</abstract>"
2023,China,Comparing Response Behaviors to System-Limit and System-Malfunction Failures with Four Levels of Operational Proficiency,"<title>Comparing Response Behaviors to System-Limit and System-Malfunction Failures with Four Levels of Operational Proficiency</title> <abstract>Commercial aircraft are becoming highly automated, but pilots must take control if automation systems fail. Failures can be due to known limitations (system-limit failures) or unforeseen malfunctions (system-malfunction failures). This study quantifies the impact of these failures on response performance and monitoring behavior, considering four levels of operational proficiency. In a flight simulator with pitch, roll, and yaw, 24 participants experienced both types of failures at different proficiency levels. The results showed that system-malfunction failure response times were 3.644, 2.471, 2.604, and 4.545 times longer than system-limit failure response times at proficiency levels 1 to 4. Monitoring behaviors (fixation duration, saccade duration, fixation rate) differed between failure types and proficiency levels. Considering these differences in response performance and monitoring behavior between failure types, it is important to differentiate between system-limit and system-malfunction failures in the literature and not overlook the influence of proficiency. Furthermore, due to the unpredictability of system-malfunctions, it is crucial to develop pilots’ psychological models and training theories regarding the operation of automated systems, fostering their core competency to excel in handling unknown situations. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>"

Design/methodology/approach: Online survey data were collected from 234 flight attendants who work for five low-cost airlines based in Thailand. The data were analyzed by using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that trust in an organization and trait mindfulness are negatively associated with the perceived stress of flight attendants. Their associations are also partially mediated by optimism. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis reveals that trait mindfulness intensifies the positive association between trust in organizations and optimism. Originality/value: The evidence from this research broadens COR theory by showing that different aspects of resources can be combined to strengthen the ability of individuals to gain more resources to lessen stress. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"

Background: The negative effect of airline pilots' flight experience on safety performance has received attention but has not been extensively investigated. Method: Using a sample of 45 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we not only tested the mediation model in which the relationship between TFH and exceedance rate was mediated by HA, but also tested the moderation model in which the relationship between HA and exceedance rate was moderated by TFH. Results: TFH positively predict flight exceedance rates; more importantly, it moderated the effect of HA on flight exceedance rates. Specifically, TFH exacerbated the negative effect of HA on flight exceedance rates. Meanwhile, the mediating effect of HA was not significant. Conclusion: Results implies the nonlinear relationship between TFH, HA, and flight safety performance. The moderation model indicates that the experience-related risks may appear before 5000 h for an individual commercial airline pilot. Application: Researchers, safety managers, and policymakers in the aviation industry that conduct pilots' psychological competency research in the Professionalism Lifecycle Management (PLM) system should be aware of the potentially interactive effects of hazardous attitude and experience on commercial airline pilots’ flight safety performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"

Study design: A randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based app intervention for improving health behaviors and cardiometabolic health parameters. Setting/participants: A total of 186 airline pilots (aged 43.2±9.1 years; male, 64%) were recruited and participated in the trial during 2022. Intervention: This intervention was a personalized, 16-week smartphone-based app multicomponent physical activity, healthy eating, and sleep hygiene intervention. Main outcome measures: Outcome measures of objective health (Cooper's 12-minute exercise test, resting heart rate, push ups, plank isometric hold, body mass), subjective health (self-rated health, perceived psychological stress and fatigue), and health behaviors (weekly physical activity, sleep quality and duration, fruit and vegetable intake) were collected at baseline and after intervention. The waitlist control completed the same measures. Results: Significant interactions for time Χ group from baseline to 16 weeks were found for all outcome measures (p<0.001). Significant between-group differences for positive health changes in favor of the intervention group were found after intervention for all outcome measures (p<0.05, d=0.4–1.0) except for self-rated health, body mass, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. Conclusions: Study findings show that an app-based health behavior intervention can elicit positive cardiometabolic health changes among airline pilots over 16 weeks, associated with trivial to large effect sizes.

Air accident investigation has provided a wealth of knowledge that has advanced the aviation industry and its safety. International Civil Aviation Organization has exercised international regulatory leadership since 1947, developing tools with international cooperation, such as the air accident investigation methodology. ICAO has forged a change in perspective on safety attributions or factors in different historical eras, using this methodology to deepen the understanding of the causes and thereby achieve aviation safety improvement. Authors aimed to analyze, through a detailed study of the world’s worst aviation accidents, their contribution to understanding the details of aviation safety culture. Be-yond the technical issues and fatality rates, the necessary analysis is what knowledge researchers have gained from the beginning, exploring the attributions of reports and knowing what diverse factors have predomi-nated in different eras. Descriptive analyzes of air disaster investigation have two objectives: to identify the beginnings of a global safety culture resulting from evolution in operational safety and to relate the different eras to the attributions of air accident investigations. © 2023 The Author(s).</abstract>"

The aim of this study was to determine if daily consumption of a SYNBIO® probiotics–elderberry extract supplement (ACTIVE) may contribute to the well-being of flight attendants. Forty healthy crew members enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study consumed one ACTIVE capsule/day or placebo for 30 days. Bowel well-being, health-related quality of life, and gastrointestinal tolerance were assessed by validated questionnaires. Saliva and fecal samples were analyzed to determine secretory immunoglobulin-A (sIgA) levels and to characterize gut microbiota composition, respectively. ACTIVE subjects presented a physiological improvement and a statistically significant higher Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) global score compared to PLACEBO subjects. The ACTIVE subjects showed significantly increased levels of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria compared to the PLACEBO group, while a significant increase in lactobacilli and a significant reduction in Enterobacteriaceae were registered when compared with the beginning of supplementation, confirming the persistence of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract and the direct antagonism and competitive exclusion effects. Additionally, sIgA levels were significantly higher in the ACTIVE group compared to the baseline and to the PLACEBO group at the end of supplementation. The ACTIVE supplementation might be beneficial to airline crew members, improving their physiological state, their immune defenses, and the strength and efficiency of their gastrointestinal tract when responding to stressful conditions. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>"
2023,China,Can family-work conflict influence safety behavior in airline pilots? The mediating role of fatigue and the moderating role of extraversion,"<title>Can family-work conflict influence safety behavior in airline pilots? The mediating role of fatigue and the moderating role of extraversion</title> <abstract>Airline pilot safety behavior is vital to inflight safety. Drawing upon the conservation of resources theory, this study examined whether family-work conflict (FWC) would influence airline pilot safety behavior, whether fatigue would mediate the link between FWC and safety behavior, and whether extraversion would play a moderating role in the relationships. Data were obtained by investigating a sample of 331 civil pilots and their supervisors from two Chinese airlines. The results showed that FWC negatively affected safety behavior (including safety compliance and safety participation), and fatigue played a mediating role in these relationships. Furthermore, the findings suggested that higher levels of extraversion mitigated the effect of FWC on fatigue, as well as the effect of FWC on safety compliance and safety participation. These findings demonstrated a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which FWC influences pilots’ safety behavior and contributed to occupational safety literature. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future research directions are provided and discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

2023,Finland - United Kingdom,Commercial Aircraft-Assisted Suicide Accident Investigations Re-Visited—Agreeing to Disagree?,"<title>Commercial Aircraft-Assisted Suicide Accident Investigations Re-Visited—Agreeing to Disagree?</title> <abstract>Background: The number of aircraft-assisted suicides can only be considered a rough estimate because it is difficult and, at times, impossible to identify all cases of suicide. Methods: Four recent reports of accidents occurring in 1997 in Indonesia, 1999 in Massachusetts in the United States, 2013 in Namibia, and 2015 in France related to commercial aircraft-assisted suicides were analyzed. This analysis relied on data extracted from the accident reports that supported aircraft-assisted suicide from the: (a) cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR), (b) medical history, (c) psychosocial history, (d) toxicology, (e) autopsy, and (f) any methodology that utilized aviation medicine. There are some limitations in this study. Although all analyzed accident investigations followed ICAO Annex 13 guidelines, there is variability in their accident investigations and reporting. In addition, accident investigation reports represent accidents from 1997 to 2015, and during this time, there has been a change in the way accidents are reported. The nature of this analysis is explorative. The aim was to identify how the various aircraft accident investigators concluded that the accidents were due to suicidal acts. Results: In all four accident reports, FDR data were available. CVR data were also available, except for one accident where CVR data were only partially available. Comprehensive medical and psychosocial histories were available in only one of four of the accident reports. Conclusion: To prevent accidents involving commercial aircraft, it is necessary to identify the causes of these accidents to be able to provide meaningful safety recommendations. A detailed psychological autopsy of pilots can and likely will assist in investigations, as well as generate recommendations that will substantially contribute to mitigating accidents due to pilot suicide. Airborne image recording may be a useful tool to provide additional information about events leading up to a crash and thus assist in accident investigations. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>"
2023,Canada - China,Mining attention distribution paradigm: Discover gaze patterns and their association rules behind the visual image,"<title>Mining attention distribution paradigm: Discover gaze patterns and their association rules behind the visual image</title> <abstract>Background and Objective: Attention allocation reflects the way of humans filtering and organizing the information. On one hand, different task scenarios seriously affect human's rule of attention distribution, on the other hand, visual attention reflecting the cognitive and psychological process. Most of the previous studies on visual attention allocation are based on cognitive models, predicted models, or statistical analysis of eye movement data or visual images, however, these methods are inadequate to provide an inside view of gaze behavior to reveal the attention distribution pattern within scenario context. Moreover, they seldom study the association rules of these patterns. Therefore, we adopted the big data mining approach to discover the paradigm of visual attention distribution. Methods: We applied the data mining method to extract the gaze patterns to discover the regularities of attention distribution behavior within the scenario context. The proposed method consists of three components, tasks scenario segmented and clustered, gaze pattern mining, and association rule of frequent pattern mining. Results: The proposed approach is tested on the operation platform. The complex operation task is simultaneously segmented and clustered with the TICC-based method and evaluated by the BCI index. The operator's eye movement frequent patterns and their association rule are discovered. The results demonstrate that our method can associate the eye-tracking data with the task-oriented scene data. Discussion: The proposed method provides the benefits of being able to explicitly express and quantitatively analyze people's visual attention patterns. The proposed method can not only be applied in the field of aerospace medicine and aviation psychology, but also can likely be applied to computer-aided diagnosis and follow-up tool for neurological disease and cognitive impairment related disease, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), neglect syndrome, social attention differences in ASD (Autism spectrum disorder). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"

In an idealized flight operation that has become real thanks to the implementation of more and more sophisticated tools, Air Force personnel must deal with the dangers inherent in an aeronautical environment. These specific constraints (the decrease of atmospheric pressure, constraints related to the aircraft, equipment and mission) justify an adaptation of the current medical-psychological training in the armed forces. This preparation is continuous throughout the different stages of an airman's career, both in terms of expertise and medical and psychological support, through a process carried out by different actors, which include the medical service of clinical psychology applied to aeronautics (SMPCAA). It aims to ensure both flight safety and the mental health of the flight crew. The medical-psychological assessment in aeronautics is based on military and international regulations. A qualified psychiatrist, having adequate knowledge and experience in aviation medecine, explores anamnesis and the behavioral, affective and cognitive fields to evaluate the airman's prognosis for adaptation. In addition to the medical history or current psychiatric disorders, the psychiatrist looks for a pathological or delusional personality, contraphobic, escapist, fragile or non-authentic motivation. An airman's mental fitness during their career is more nuanced than their initial mental health which does not take into consideration the necessary adaptation to the job. Medical and psychological support takes place in the continuity of the normal fitness assessment. SMPCAA coordinates this support, with the Air Force's clinical psychology unit (CPC'Air). This unit, which was initially created to carry out post-immediate medical-psychological interventions following serious traumatic events, also provides training, operational psychological support, and psychotherapy. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract>"

It is part of a new perspective aimed at understanding better the concept of commitment, a powerful determinant of employee retention, by looking at gone commitments. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a qualitative methodology recommended in the most recent commitment literature, life story interviews (Study 1 – flight attendants) and non-directive interviews (Study 2 – pilots) were conducted. Findings: The authors propose a revised process model of quondam commitments, including the possible transformation of a commitment bond into a different type of psychological bond over time. Research limitations/implications: The sample sizes are limited because of the qualitative nature of both studies, and the quondam commitment outcomes could only be studied at the individual level. However, the innovative nature of the work offers important contributions and avenues for research. Practical implications: This study provides concrete perspectives for hospitality professionals to retain employees who question their relationship with work. Its relevance goes beyond the airline sector and can be applied to the hotel or restaurant industry, looking for solutions to deal with massive attrition. Originality/value: This research contributes to filling three gaps identified in the commitment literature. It is one of the very rare studies considering closely both multiple targets and multiple types of psychological bonds. Moreover, it incorporates their dynamics, beyond the commitment bond, and suggests a refined model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"

Despite widespread interest and numerous empirical investigations, definitive answers to the question “How much skill is retained after a period of disuse?” remain elusive. Shortcomings with the literature were identified that limit the ability of researchers to develop models of skill decay for various tasks, including medical/health care, military, sports, and other applications. Problems with design, measurement, analysis, and interpretation aspects of research are reviewed. An empirical study of acquisition and retention after a 1-month delay for four tasks is presented: (1) A mid fidelity air traffic control simulation, (2) a low-fidelity air traffic control task, and (3, 4) two versions of a perceptual/memory search task, with data from 150 participants. The results illustrate how different approaches to measurement and analysis lead to biased interpretations of decay, especially in the context of relearning. Recommendations are provided for research that can clarify decay functions for procedural tasks and may generate improved understanding and actionable models for refresher training programs to optimize skill retention over extended time periods. © 2023 American Psychological Association</abstract>"
2023,United Kingdom - United States,A Qualitative Investigation of Space Exploration Medical Evacuation Risks,"<title>A Qualitative Investigation of Space Exploration Medical Evacuation Risks</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Exploration beyond low Earth orbit requires innovative solutions to support the crew medically, especially as the opportunity for timely evacuation to Earth diminishes. This includes assessing the risks and benefits that a complicated medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) poses to the injured crewmember, the crew, and the mission. This qualitative study identifies common MEDEVAC risk assessment principles used in spaceflight and other extreme environments to better inform future risk assessment tools and exploration mission concepts. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with subject matter experts in spaceflight and analog domains, including polar operations, undersea operations, combat medicine, and mountaineering. Transcripts were analyzed using the qualitative method of Thematic Analysis with the technique of consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison. RESULTS: Subject matter experts described 18 themes divided into two main categories: Primary Risk Considerations (e.g., crew, mission, resources, time) and Contributing Factors (e.g., psychological considerations, medical preparation, politics). DISCUSSION: Primary Risk Considerations can assess MEDEVAC risk across mission phases, with Contributing Factors acting as premission tools to adjust those risks. Inter-and intracategory connections identified medical support considerations, MEDEVAC support considerations, and philosophy as the most impactful Contributing Factors. Medical support considerations, psychological considerations, and political considerations were found to have unique aspects given the distances and societal impact of exploration vs. low Earth orbit spaceflight. The Contributing Factor theme of decision making was determined to be unique due to its impacts across both categories. These findings expand current considerations and are important inputs for exploration mission MEDEVAC Concepts of Operations. © copyright by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2023,Turkey,Application of rTMS to the Motor Cortex in a Patient with Startle Reaction: A Case Report,"<title>Application of rTMS to the Motor Cortex in a Patient with Startle Reaction: A Case Report</title> <abstract>Startle reaction is a physiological muscle reaction that occurs to protect against an unexpected, sudden stimulus. In this case, we wanted to discuss the response after the rTMS protocol, which we applied to our patient who had startle reactions that severely impair functionality and who did not meet the post traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) criteria or have a major brain lesion after a traffic accident. A 30-year-old single female patient who works as a stewardess in an airline company with no known history of physical or psychological illness but lost consciousness for about three hours after an in-vehicle traffic accident a week ago was admitted to our clinic. The patient had a history of having difficulty in doing her daily work due to the splashing movements that started in her body. No major brain lesion was detected in imaging studies. She did not meet the criteria for PTSD and her EEG results were normal. Medication did not help with the symptoms, so, rTMS was planned. After 6 sessions of rTMS, her movements had stopped completely. Our patient, who did not fully meet the criteria for PTSD and whose imaging and EEG results did not reveal any pathological findings had developed severe onset startle reactions after an in-vehicle traffic accident, fully responded to rTMS treatment and improved her functionality quickly and effectively. Thus, we think that rTMS should be investigated as an effective treatment method in such patients. © 2022 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.</abstract>"
2023,Ireland - Italy,A Mixed-Method Study on Job Satisfaction Among Air Traffic Controllers During the Pandemic: The Roles of Work-Family Interface and Resilience,"<title>A Mixed-Method Study on Job Satisfaction Among Air Traffic Controllers During the Pandemic: The Roles of Work-Family Interface and Resilience</title> <abstract>Objective: To investigate whether workload is negatively related to job satisfaction, directly and indirectly, via work-family conflict, and conditional on resilience levels. Background: Covid-19 restriction measures severely affected the aviation sector leading air traffic controllers to face periodic fluctuations in air traffic volume. Despite their key role in ensuring the efficiency and safety of air traffic management, little is known about the psychological issues faced by air traffic controllers during the pandemic. Method: A total of 168 Italian air traffic controllers completed an online self-report survey assessing workload, work-family conflict, job satisfaction, resilience, and Covid-19-related experience. Descriptive statistics and moderated mediation analyses were performed. To deepen the quantitative results, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted, and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Workload was positively related to work-family conflict which, in turn, was negatively associated with job satisfaction. Resilience buffered this association. The following six main themes emerged from the interviews: the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; double-edged job characteristics; job-related risk stressors; protective resources; work-life interface; and consequences. Conclusion: Air traffic controllers who were confronted with sudden increases in air traffic volume were more likely to experience work-family conflict and then be less satisfied with their job. However, resilience was a protective factor against lower job satisfaction under high work-family conflict levels. Qualitative results deepened these findings. The practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2023,"Korea, Republic of",Daily Relationships Between Job Insecurity and Emotional Labor Amid COVID-19: Mediation of Ego Depletion and Moderation of Off-Job Control and Work-Related Smartphone Use,"<title>Daily Relationships Between Job Insecurity and Emotional Labor Amid COVID-19: Mediation of Ego Depletion and Moderation of Off-Job Control and Work-Related Smartphone Use</title> <abstract>The economic recession in the service sector during the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized service employees’ job security. While the daily fluctuations of perceived job insecurity may have implications for service employees’ emotional labor, the day-to-day relationship between these two variables and their mediating and moderating mechanisms in the pandemic context remain unknown. To fill this gap, our research examined the day-level relationship between job insecurity perceptions, ego depletion, and emotional labor, as well as the moderating effects of overnight off-job control and work-related smartphone use. To assess these relationships, we conducted two daily studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. In study 1 (March–April 2020), 135 service employees responded to morning and evening online surveys for five workdays. In study 2 (June 2022),which administered morning and evening online surveys to 90 flight attendants for fiveworkdays, work-related COVID-19 exposure risk was controlled in the analyses. The results of the two studies demonstrated that on a day when service employees perceived a high level of job insecurity, they felt egodepleted, which, in turn, was associated with decreased deep acting and increased surface acting. Post hoc findings indicated a significant three-way interaction between off-job control, off-job work-related smartphone use, and daily job insecurity, such that the job insecurity–ego depletion–emotional labor was most pronounced when off-job control was low and off-job work-related smartphone use was high. © 2023 American Psychological Association</abstract>"
2023,United Kingdom,Assessing Expertise Using Eye Tracking in a Virtual Reality Flight Simulation,"<title>Assessing Expertise Using Eye Tracking in a Virtual Reality Flight Simulation</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this work was to examine the fidelity and validity of an aviation simulation using eye tracking. Background: Commercial head-mounted virtual reality (VR) systems offer a convenient and cost-effective alternative to existing aviation simulation (e.g., for refresher exercises). We performed pre-implementation testing of a novel aviation simulation, designed for head-mounted VR, to determine its fidelity and validity as a training device. Method: Eighteen airline pilots, with varying levels of flight experience, completed a sequence of training ‘flows.’ Self-reported measures of presence and workload and users’ perceptions of fidelity were taken. Pilots’ eye movements and performance were recorded to determine whether more experienced pilots showed distinct performance and eye gaze profiles in the simulation, as they would in the real-world. Results: Real-world expertise correlated with eye gaze patterns characterized by fewer, but longer, fixations and a scan path that was more structured and less random. Multidimensional scaling analyses also indicated differential clustering of strategies in more versus less experienced pilots. Subjective ratings of performance, however, showed little relationship with real-world expertise or eye movements. Conclusion: We adopted an evidence-based approach to assessing the fidelity and validity of a VR flight training tool. Pilot reports indicated the simulation was realistic and potentially useful for training, while direct measurement of eye movements was useful for establishing construct validity and psychological fidelity of the simulation. © 2023 The Author(s).

2023,"Taiwan, Province of China",Factors related to burnout and its effects on mental and physical symptoms and daytime dysfunction among female flight attendants,"<title>Factors related to burnout and its effects on mental and physical symptoms and daytime dysfunction among female flight attendants</title> <abstract>In this study, risk factors were identified to assess the impact of burnout on the health and daytime function of 412 female flight attendants from an international airline from 2017 to 2018 with convenience sampling. Data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Analysis of variance, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and independent t-tests were used to assess the relationships between burnout and demographic and work-related factors. A structural equation model analysis was performed to assess the effect of burnout impact factors on mental health using the Brief Symptom Rating Scale, six common physical symptoms, and daytime dysfunction (a subscale of the Athens Insomnia Scale). The results showed a moderate level of burnout, as reported by 19.2 percent of the participants. Personal and work-related characteristics, including marital status and working hours, were not significantly associated with burnout. Smoking behavior was the only significant risk factor (T = −3.64). The impact model of burnout revealed a moderate direct effect of burnout on mental health symptoms (95 percent CI: 0.27, 0.47) and daytime dysfunction (95 percent CI: 0.04, 0.11) and a small direct effect on physical symptoms (95 percent CI: 0.28, 0.47). Our findings increase our understanding of the risk and impact factors related to burnout in female flight attendants. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2023,Ireland - United Kingdom,Quick coherence technique facilitating commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience to the impact of COVID-19,"<title>Quick coherence technique facilitating commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience to the impact of COVID-19</title> <abstract>This study investigates the effect of quick coherence technique (QCT) on commercial pilots’ resilience to the unprecedented impact of a pandemic. Eighteen commercial pilots voluntarily participated in a 2-day training course on QCT followed by 2 months of self-regulated QCT practicing during controlled rest in the flight deck and day-to day life. There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots’ psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots’ mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique. Practitioner summary: QCT breathing has been proven to increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental/physical capacity and sustaining positive emotions to deal with the challenges both on the flight deck and in everyday life.HIGHLIGHTS Pilots have suffered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across many factors including social, economic, mental, physical, emotional, and operational issues Biofeedback training can increase commercial pilots’ resilience by moderating psychophysiological coherence, strengthening mental and physical capacity Self-regulated practicing QCT to form a habitual behaviour is required to sustain the maximum benefits either in the flight or day-to-day life QCT is an effective intervention for aviation authorities and airline operators to develop peer support programs to increase pilots’ fatigue resilience. © 2022 The Author(s).

2023,China,The risk-taking behavioural intentions of pilots in adverse weather conditions: an application of the theory of planned behaviour,"<title>The risk-taking behavioural intentions of pilots in adverse weather conditions: an application of the theory of planned behaviour</title> <abstract>This paper examined pilots’ risk-taking behavioural intentions based on the theory of planned behaviour, as well as the impact of experience on behavioural intentions in adverse weather conditions. Two hundred and seventy-three airline pilots and flying cadets were divided into two groups and asked to complete a questionnaire based on two decision-making scenarios. This questionnaire measured pilots’ intentions to take risks, along with the attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control (PBC), risk perception, and self-identity. The results showed that attitude, subjective norm, PBC, and risk perception explained 52% of the variance in behavioural intentions. Additionally, pilots’ risk-taking decisions can be influenced by experience. Inexperienced pilots had a relatively stronger intention to take risks and a more favourable attitude towards risky behaviour. Moreover, pilots were more likely to rely on their own direct experience in the decision-making process. Practitioner summary: This study examined the pilots’ risk-taking intentions under adverse weather conditions using a questionnaire based on the TPB theory. Results demonstrated that the TPB model can be applied to the risk-taking scenario and that experience can influence pilots’ decisions. These findings have implications for improving flight safety and lowering accident rates. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2023,United Kingdom,To what extent is circadian phase predictive of subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew pre- and post-trip?,"<title>To what extent is circadian phase predictive of subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew pre- and post-trip?</title> <abstract>Long-haul cabin crew regularly report misalignment between their circadian phase and the external world (i.e. jet lag). The extent to which changes in circadian phase relate to reported levels of jet lag remains unclear. The main aim of the present study was first to evaluate the relationship between objective (circadian phase) and subjective jet lag and second to explore the relative role of both subjective and objective psycho-behavioural factors in predicting the subjective experience of jet lag. Twenty-eight long-haul cabin crew completed questionnaires measuring diurnal preference, trip characteristics and subjective jet lag as a single and as a multidimensional measure. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and urinary melatonin peak time was measured, at baseline (T1), e.g. before a long-haul trip and post-trip on the crew's first recovery day (T2). Subjective jet lag was also measured at both time points. At T1, later circadian phase related to increased unidimensional jet lag, however, a post-trip discrepancy was found between objective and subjective uni- and multidimensional jet lag measured at T2 and change from T1 to T2. After controlling for direction and size of circadian phase, increased uni- and multidimensional subjective jet lag was predicted by depressed mood states. The regression models including phase, diurnal preference, departure time on the outbound sector and arousal levels accounted for 28% of the variance in unidimensional jet lag and 53% of the variance in multidimensional jet lag. It was concluded that there is a discordance between objective and subjective jet lag post-trip. Further, subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew is better explained by mood impairment than circadian phase. The results are discussed with reference to the gap between subjective and objective jet lag and the role of psychology rather than just biology in the jet lag experience. The implications for improving health and safety in the workplace, through a better understanding of the role of human factors in the management of jet lag, are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2023,China,Linkage of calling and burnout among Chinese airline pilots: the role of psychological capital and organizational identification,"<title>Linkage of calling and burnout among Chinese airline pilots: the role of psychological capital and organizational identification</title> <abstract>Objectives. Burnout of airline pilots has an extremely adverse impact on their physical and mental state, their work efficiency and safe operation of airlines, and is thus an important issue in occupational safety and health. Therefore, it is crucial to identify factors that may reduce burnout among airline pilots. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, the present study investigates the relationships between calling, psychological capital, organizational identification and burnout in order to understand the mechanisms underlying pilot burnout. Method. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to measure calling, psychological capital, organizational identification and burnout among a sample consisting of 242 Chinese commercial airline pilots (age: M 31.60 years, SD 6.44). Correlation analysis, mediation analysis and moderated analysis were conducted. Results. The results showed that calling has a direct and negative effect on pilot burnout, and an indirect effect on burnout through influencing psychological capital. Moreover, organizational identification was found to positively moderate the negative relationship between calling and pilot burnout. Conclusion. This study contributes to deepening theoretical research on burnout, and provides empirical evidence for effective intervention in the burnout of airline pilots, which is beneficial to reduce pilot human error and ensure flight safety. Future research directions are also discussed. © 2022 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).</abstract>"
2022,Italy,Safety at high altitude: the importance of emotional dysregulation on pilots’ risk attitudes during flight,"<title>Safety at high altitude: the importance of emotional dysregulation on pilots’ risk attitudes during flight</title> <abstract>Introduction: Aviation psychology is very interested in understanding how personological and psychological variables influence flight performances. Indeed, risk attitudes have been considered as a risk factor for aviation accidents. In this context, emotions and coping style are key variables which could influence concentration by affecting cognition and attention. In addition, the specific training backgrounds seemed to be associated with differences in in-flight accident rates. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between age, sex, flight experience, emotional dysregulation, coping styles, flight licenses, and pilots’ risk attitudes. Methods: Eighty pilots completed an online survey composed of ad hoc questionnaire for sociodemographic and work-related information’s and self-report questionnaires that assessed emotional dysregulation, coping styles, and risk attitudes. Results: Results showed that older age and emotional dysregulation were associated with higher risk attitudes in pilots. Moreover, emotional dysregulation seemed to promote worse self-confidence. Ultralight pilots appeared to be more risk-oriented and less self-confident than civil pilots, while more flight experience appeared to favorite greater self-confidence. Discussion: In conclusion, the study suggests the importance of promoting interventions based on sharing pilots’ difficulties and emotions and promoting safe attitudes with special attention to ultralight pilots, age, and sex differences. © © 2022 Luciani, Veneziani, Ciacchella, Rocchi, Reho, Gennaro and Lai.</abstract>"

In a pair of longitudinal studies, we used two waves of data from garment factory workers (Study 1 [T1: 2017, T2: 2019]: n = 344) and flight attendants (Study 2 [T1: 2017/2018, T2: 2020]: n = 1402) to examine the prospective associations of suffering with 16 outcomes across different domains of health and well-being: physical health, health behavior, mental health, psychological well-being, character strengths, and social well-being. The primary analysis involved a series of regression analyses in which each T2 outcome was regressed on overall suffering assessed at T1, adjusting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics and the baseline value (or close proxy) of the outcome assessed at T1. In Study 1, associations of overall suffering with worse subsequent health and well-being were limited to a single outcome on each of the domains of physical health and mental health. Overall suffering was more consistently related to worse subsequent health and well-being in Study 2, with associations emerging for all but two outcomes. The pattern of findings for each study was largely similar when aspects of suffering were modeled individually, although associations for some aspects of suffering differed from those that emerged for overall suffering. Our findings suggest that suffering may have important implications for the health and well-being of worker populations. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract>"
2022,Australia - China,Exploring the Peak-End Effects in Air Traffic Controllers’ Mental Workload Ratings,"<title>Exploring the Peak-End Effects in Air Traffic Controllers’ Mental Workload Ratings</title> <abstract>Objective: This study examined whether professional air traffic controllers (ATCos) were subject to peak-end effects in reporting their mental workload after performing an air traffic control task, and in predicting their mental workload in future scenarios. Background: In affective experience studies, people’s evaluation of a period of experience is strongly influenced by the most intense (peak) point and the endpoint. However, whether the effects exist in mental workload evaluations made by professional operators is still not known. Method: In Study 1, 20 ATCos performed air traffic control scenarios on high-fidelity radar simulators and reported their mental workload. We used a 2 (high peak, low peak) × 2 (high end, low end) within-subject design. In Study 2, another group of 43 ATCos completed a survey asking them to predict their mental workload given the same air traffic control scenarios. Results: In Study 1, ATCos reported higher mental workload after completing the high-peak and the high-end scenarios. In contrast, in Study 2, ATCos predicted the peak workload effect but not the end workload effect when asked to predict their experience in dealing with the same scenarios. Conclusion: Peak and end effects exist in subjective mental workload evaluation, but experts only had meta-cognitive awareness of the peak effect, and not the end effect. Application: Researchers and practitioners that use subjective workload estimates for work design decisions need to be aware of the potential impact of peak and end task demand effects on subjective mental workload ratings provided by expert operators. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"

This section is not mandatory. The specific professions of aviation personnel include the professions of the pilot and air traffic controller. These occupations are specific in that while performing their work, they must be able to simultaneously operate the devices in the handling area and in the pedipulation area, supplemented by acoustic sensations in the form of correspondence between flying and ground stations. The performance requirements of pilots and air traffic controllers place high demands on their health, psychological condition, attention, and concentration, due to being in constant pursuit of minimization of erroneous decisions, otherwise defined as the human factor in aviation. This article is focused on the development and testing of a technical device for measuring the relative error rate of students in multitasking tasks in preparation for employment. The main result is a designed technical device with hardware (HW) and software (SW) parts. An experimental method was used to measure the qualitative and quantitative performance indicators of the test subjects. The results of the experiment were observed and evaluated based on the analytical-synthetic method based on critical thinking. By comparing and abstracting the measured data, the reference values of the performance indicators of the tested subjects were determined. The selection of the final sample of subjects consisted of two phases. In the first phase, questionnaires were evaluated, and in the second phase, reaction time measurements during multitasking tasks using technical equipment were evaluated. Based on the measurements, an error ratio was defined, which could be graphically represented. The testing proved the full functionality of the designed technical equipment for these purposes in aviation education. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>"

This descriptive cross-sectional study used data from 161 Korean cabin crew members. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-tests, and chi-square tests. Of the participants, 62.7% were women, and 52.2% and 46.6% were classified into the depression and anxiety groups, respectively. No differences in the general characteristics between the non-depression and depression groups were found. However, in the anxiety group, there were significant differences in age, marital status, position, and work type during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the anxiety group showed a higher anger state (approximately 6.76 times higher than the normal group) than the depression group (approximately 4.90 times higher than the normal group).

DCS can sometimes be observed as a cluster of cases, which is referred to as epidemic DCS. In this report, we aim to evaluate an epidemic DCS episode that occurred following two consecutive HHT sessions. METHODS: A total of 16 trainees, all of whom were medical doctors, attended the aviation medicine training course in the aeromedical research and training center. They went through HHT in two sessions, each with eight trainees. RESULTS: Following two HHT sessions, five Type 1 DCS cases occurred among 18 personnel (16 trainees and 2 inside observers). DCS incidence rate was found to be 27.77%. They were successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). DISCUSSION: S ince the DCS incidence rate was found to be higher than the average in such a short period of time, this cluster of cases was labeled as epidemic DCS. We carried out a thorough investigation into all possible causes by following some templates that were developed to conduct comprehensive investigations into epidemic DCS episodes. According to the psychological arguments discussed here, we placed a special emphasis on hysterical and psychosocial components, among other probable factors. In cases where the possibility of hysteria and placebo-nocebo responses exist, it is appropriate to conduct the training and treatment processes with these factors in mind. No matter what the triggering factor is and how the symptoms manifest, HBOT remains crucial in the treatment of DCS. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2022,Russian Federation,Applications of methods of psychological support developed for astronauts for use in medical settings,"<title>Applications of methods of psychological support developed for astronauts for use in medical settings</title> <abstract>Over the past 40 years, psychological support (PS) for cosmonauts and astronauts has remained an important part of the regular biomedical provision of space crews during extended orbital flights. It includes well-developed principles and a set of methods that have proven its effectiveness for the maintenance of behavioral health under extreme conditions of space flight. The main principle of PS in flight is to restore the usual sensory input to compensate for the monotony and lack of external stimuli as a result of a long stay under isolation and confinement. Risk factors for the psychological health and well-being defined for the astronauts, such as sensory and social deprivation, monotony, confinement, and lack of privacy, also remain part and parcel of several civil professions. These include polar wintering, submarines, working on oil platforms, and ocean fishing. Most of these factors also adversely affect the recovery rate of a large contingent of medical institutions, especially bedridden patients with chronic diseases. Finally, due to the negative epidemiological situation associated with the spread of COVID-19, an increasingly wide range of citizens forced to be in self-isolation faces negative manifestations of the deprivation phenomena described previously. Several cases of successful use of PS under isolation, monotony, crowding, and confinement are presented. Thus, we assume that the use of psychological support methods developed for space flights could be extremely relevant in civil medicine and everyday life. © © 2022 Rozanov, Ryumin, Karpova, Shved, Savinkina, Kuznetsova, Diaz Rey, Shishenina and Gushin.</abstract>"
2022,Poland - United States,Are depression and suffering distinct? An empirical analysis,"<title>Are depression and suffering distinct? An empirical analysis</title> <abstract>Depression and the subjective experience of suffering are distinct forms of distress, but they are sometimes commingled with one another. Using a cross-sectional sample of flight attendants (n = 4,652), we tested for further empirical evidence distinguishing depression and suffering. Correlations with 15 indices covering several dimensions of well-being (i.e., physical health, emotional well-being, psychological well-being, character strengths, social well-being, financial/material well-being) indicated that associations with worse well-being were mostly stronger for depression than suffering. There was a large positive correlation between depression and suffering, but we also found evidence of notable non-concurrent depression and suffering in the sample. After dividing participants into four groups that varied based on severity of depression and suffering, regression analyses showed higher levels of well-being among those with both none-mild depression and none-mild suffering compared to those with moderate-severe depression, moderate-severe suffering, or both. All indices of well-being were lowest among the group of participants with moderate-severe depression and moderate-severe suffering. In addition to providing further evidence supporting a distinction between depression and suffering, our findings suggest that concurrent depression and suffering may be more disruptive to well-being than when either is present alone. © © 2022 Cowden, Wȩziak-Białowolska, McNeely and VanderWeele.</abstract>"
2022,Iceland - United Kingdom,Assessing Cognitive Workload Using Cardiovascular Measures and Voice,"<title>Assessing Cognitive Workload Using Cardiovascular Measures and Voice</title> <abstract>Monitoring cognitive workload has the potential to improve both the performance and fidelity of human decision making. However, previous efforts towards discriminating further than binary levels (e.g., low/high or neutral/high) in cognitive workload classification have not been successful. This lack of sensitivity in cognitive workload measurements might be due to individual differences as well as inadequate methodology used to analyse the measured signal. In this paper, a method that combines the speech signal with cardiovascular measurements for screen and heartbeat classification is introduced. For validation, speech and cardiovascular signals from 97 university participants and 20 airline pilot participants were collected while cognitive stimuli of varying difficulty level were induced with the Stroop colour/word test. For the trinary classification scheme (low, medium, high cognitive workload) the prominent result using classifiers trained on each participant achieved 15.17 ± 0.79% and 17.38 ± 1.85% average misclassification rates indicating good discrimination at three levels of cognitive workload. Combining cardiovascular and speech measures synchronized to each heartbeat and consolidated with short-term dynamic measures might therefore provide enhanced sensitivity in cognitive workload monitoring. The results show that the influence of individual differences is a limiting factor for a generic classification and highlights the need for research to focus on methods that incorporate individual differences to achieve even better results. This method can potentially be used to measure and monitor workload in real time in operational environments. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>"
2022,Australia - China,Non-Contact Negative Mood State Detection Using Reliability-Focused Multi-Modal Fusion Model,"<title>Non-Contact Negative Mood State Detection Using Reliability-Focused Multi-Modal Fusion Model</title> <abstract>Negative mood states include tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion, which represent the weak internal emotions of a human. Negative mood states exert adverse impact on individuals' ability to make rational decisions, which entails the practicable method of negative mood state detection. The most commonly used negative mood state detection methods are based on the psychological scale, which requires additional work and brings inconvenience to the subject in the application scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel non-contact negative mood state detection method according to the knowledge of affective computing. The POMS-net model is used to extract temporal-spatial features from visible and infrared thermal videos, and the negative mood state detection is realized using data reliability-focused multi-modal fusion. The proposed method is verified using the HDT-BR dataset collected in the aerospace medicine experiment 'Earth-Star II' and the VIRI public dataset. The experimental results on the datasets verify that our method outperforms the comparison methods. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>"
2022,China,Analysis of two naval pilots’ ejection injuries: Two case reports,"<title>Analysis of two naval pilots’ ejection injuries: Two case reports</title> <abstract>Recently, two naval pilots in a two-seat trainer jet were forced to eject urgently due to sudden mechanical failure during night-time training. They were both successfully rescued and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. In this study, we investigate their ejection injuries and recovery process. CASE SUMMARY We analyzed the clinical data of the traumatic condition and recovery process from ejection injuries of two pilots who ejected from a failed trainer jet and survived. After being successfully rescued and sent to the hospital, they were diagnosed with multiple ejection injuries, including eye trauma, limb bone and joint injury, rib and spine injury, and so on. Both cases underwent fluid replacement, acid suppression, nutritional support, hemostasis, bone metabolism improvement, phlegm elimination, psychological measurement, blood circulation promotion and detumescence, physical therapy, and external fixation with braces for 1 mo before being discharged from hospital. They then recuperated in a sanatorium for 2 mo, and the related laboratory tests and supplementary examinations show that they recovered from all the above injuries. After successfully passing the psychological test and physical examination, they returned to flight duty 3 mo after ejection. CONCLUSION The causes and conditions of ejection injury in the pilots were very complex. Although they finally recovered quickly and were released, it also serves as a reminder that attention should be paid to pilots’ ejection and parachute training in order to significantly reduce ejection injury and improve the ejection success rate. In addition, air defense support personnel should strengthen search and rescue and on-site emergency measures, and locate and rescue pilots in distress as early as possible to reduce subsequent injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.

From the viewpoint of positive psychology, this study compared the different media effects of animated pedagogical agent (APA)-guided LKM and audio-guided LKM. A total of 82 flight attendants were recruited from airlines; then, they were randomly assigned to two groups: APA group (41 participants) and audio group (41 participants), which both underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention. The aforementioned four main variables were measured pre and post the meditation experiment. The results indicated that both APA-guided meditation and audio-guided meditation significantly improved subjects’ spirituality and SWB. Compared with audio-guided meditation, APA-guided meditation significantly improved the subjects’ spirituality, SWB, and social presence. Audio-guided meditation has no significant effect on social presence. This study highlights APA-guided meditation has a positive effect on spirituality, SWB, and social presence, which may provide individuals with a simple and easy method to improve their mental health. © © 2022 Liu, Chen, Zhou, Chiang, Chen, Wu, Huang, Liu and Chiou.</abstract>"
2022,Colombia - Portugal - Spain,The Effect of Expertise during Simulated Flight Emergencies on the Autonomic Response and Operative Performance in Military Pilots,"<title>The Effect of Expertise during Simulated Flight Emergencies on the Autonomic Response and Operative Performance in Military Pilots</title> <abstract>Heart rate variability (HRV) and performance response during emergency flight maneuvers were analyzed. Two expert pilots (ages 35 and 33) and two rookie pilots (ages 25) from the Portuguese Air Force participated in this case–control report study. Participants had to complete the following emergency protocols in a flight simulator: (1) take-off engine failure, (2) flight engine failure close to the base, (3) flight engine failure far away from the base, and (4) alternator failure. The HRV was collected during all these maneuvers, as well as the performance data (the time it took to go through the emergency protocol and the subjective information from the flight simulator operator). Results regarding autonomic modulation showed a higher sympathetic response during the emergency maneuvers when compared to baseline. In some cases, there was also a higher sympathetic response during the emergency maneuvers when compared with the take-off protocol. Regarding performance data, the expert pilots accomplished the missions in less time than the rookie pilots. Autonomic modulation measured from HRV through portable devices can easily relay important information. This information is relevant since characterizing these maneuvers can provide helpful information to design training strategies to improve those psychophysiological responses. © 2022 by the authors.</abstract>"
2022,Sweden,Selecting flight mode – Risk factors associated with presenteeism among commercial pilots and the role of depressive symptoms,"<title>Selecting flight mode – Risk factors associated with presenteeism among commercial pilots and the role of depressive symptoms</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this cross-sectional survey study was to examine psychosocial work factors, work conditions, and individual factors associated in the literature with presenteeism among Swedish Commercial Airline Pilots. Furthermore, depressive symptoms were hypothesized as a mediator between psychosocial work climate and presenteeism. Background: Sickness presenteeism is common among several occupational groups, pilots included. Inappropriate presenteeism, attending work despite feeling inappropriate for reasons other than physical ones, is also prevalent among pilots, even though they are obligated not to work in mentally or physically unfit states. Research has focused on finding risk and protective factors for the act of attending work while ill, as this is associated with both health and safety hazards to employees and organizations. Nonetheless, research on antecedents to pilot sickness and inappropriate presenteeism is scarce. Method: Data from an online self-report questionnaire targeting Swedish Commercial Airline pilots (N = 1128) was analyzed. The questionnaire covered demographics, work conditions (e.g., employment type), perceived psychosocial work climate (e.g., job demands), and depressive symptoms. Results: All psychosocial work factors were associated with both sickness and inappropriate presenteeism. Depressive symptoms acted as a partial mediator between psychosocial work climate and presenteeism. Being directly or atypically employed showed no significant relationship with inappropriate or sickness presenteeism. Conclusion: Perceived psychosocial work factors could transcend the significance of objective working conditions in explaining presenteeism among pilots. This highlights the importance of examining experienced psychosocial work climate regularly to mitigate the risk of presenteeism and, thus, organizational exposure to accidents and errors. © 2022 The Authors</abstract>"

EEG signals recorded while 20 professional air traffic controllers performed cognitive tasks [A-X Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) and 3-back working memory task] after they were exposed to two levels of task difficulty (high and low MWL) in the morning and afternoon. Significant decreases in cognitive performance were found when the levels of task difficulty increased in both tasks. The results confirmed the sensitivity of the theta and beta activities to levels of task difficulty in the 3-back task, while they were not affected in the AX-CPT. Theta and beta activities were influenced by time of day in the AX-CPT. The findings provide guidance for application of changes in EEG parameters when MWL level is manipulated during the day that could be implemented in future for the development of real-time monitoring systems to improve aviation safety. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>"
2022,India,Chirplet transform-based machine-learning approach towards classification of cognitive state change using galvanic skin response and photoplethysmography signals,"<title>Chirplet transform-based machine-learning approach towards classification of cognitive state change using galvanic skin response and photoplethysmography signals</title> <abstract>Recent advances in the field of cognitive sciences have provided evidence to classify activities with different cognitive engagement levels. High cognitive load and sustained attention may predispose an individual to psychological and physical stress and may result in a lack of performance. Cognitive load monitoring of professionals in high precision fields has gathered significant attention in the current research scenario. The proposed work in continuity has tried to demonstrate the use of two non-invasive physiological sensing modalities viz. galvanic skin response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG) to elucidate effectiveness in picking up differences of two induced cognitive state categories based on machine learning and statistical methods. This paper demonstrates how GSR and PPG signals data can be effectively utilized to examine the shift in cognitive load. The present work proposes the use of general linear chirplet transform (GLCT) to evaluate the time-frequency characteristic of GSR and PPG signals and utilize the statistical features in classification. Random Forest, Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbours demonstrated an accuracy of 92.13%, 88.0%, and 86.13% respectively on a dataset of 20 subjects against an optimized feature set, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for differentiating pre-defined categories of cognitive load. The study shows the potential of GSR and PPG signals attributes and time-frequency representation using GLCT to monitor cognitive load in real-life conditions. The proposed work also indicates the possibility to extend the same to attention-demanding fields such as aviation, medicine, and manufacturing for effective remediation of fatigue periods with increased cognitive demand, which, if sustained, may lead to cognitive decline in the long run. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>"
2022,China,The relationship between sense of calling and safety behavior among airline pilots: The role of harmonious safety passion and safety climate,"<title>The relationship between sense of calling and safety behavior among airline pilots: The role of harmonious safety passion and safety climate</title> <abstract>Pilot safety behavior plays a crucial role in airlines safety performance and aviation safety, so it is vital to identify factors that may enhance pilot safety behavior and explore their mechanisms. Drawing upon self-determination theory, this study examines whether, how, and when the sense of calling influences pilot safety behavior from the perspective of occupational psychology. Using a sample of 321 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between sense of calling and pilot safety behavior was mediated by harmonious safety passion and moderated by safety climate. The results indicated that the sense of calling had a positive direct effect on pilot safety behavior and that this relationship was partially mediated by harmonious safety passion. Moreover, safety climate negatively moderates the positive relationship between sense of calling and harmonious safety passion as well as the indirect effect of sense of calling on safety behavior via harmonious safety passion. In particular, sense of calling had a stronger effect on harmonious safety passion and a stronger indirect effect on safety behavior when the safety climate was lower. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for aviation safety management practices are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2022,China,Proactive Coping and Mental Health Among Airline Pilots During China's Regular Prevention and Control of COVID-19: The Role of Perceived Stress and Social Support,"<title>Proactive Coping and Mental Health Among Airline Pilots During China's Regular Prevention and Control of COVID-19: The Role of Perceived Stress and Social Support</title> <abstract>Mental health has always been a prominent public health concern, and it has become more important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mental health of airline pilots plays a significant role in their occupational health and overall performance. It is also vital for ensuring the safe operation of aircrafts. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that may improve the mental health of pilots. This study investigates the relationship between proactive coping, perceived stress, social support, and mental health among airline pilots during China's regular prevention and control of COVID-19. Using a sample consisting of 285 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model to explore whether, how, and when proactive coping affects the mental health of pilots. The results show that proactive coping has a direct and positive effect on pilots' mental health, as well as an indirect effect on mental health through its influence on perceived stress. Social support was found to weaken the relationship between perceived stress and mental health. It also weakened the indirect relationship between proactive coping and mental health through perceived stress. These findings advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that affect the mental health of pilots. It also provides empirical evidence for effective mental health interventions for airline pilots during regular prevention and control of COVID-19. © © 2022 Xu, Wu, Ji, Wang, Pan, Ma and You.</abstract>"

Utilizing a two-stage design, this study surveyed 312 flight attendants employed by two international airline companies in Malaysia and used the structural equation modeling technique to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings showed that PsyCap could significantly alleviate two directions of WFC simultaneously and promote employees’ JP. PJ fit was also identified to be an effective mitigator of WFC and FWC; however, a significant association between PJ fit and JP has not been found in this study. The findings further suggested that both WFC and FWC could mediate the association between PsyCap and JP. In addition, the fact that marital status resulted in disparity in the formation of JP was also evidenced. Airline companies should pay more attention to the positive impact of individual psychological determinants, such as PsyCap and PJ fit, which can effectively alleviate various issues in the work–family interface, thereby improving employees’ JP. © © 2022 Yan, Bai, Mansor and Choo.</abstract>"
2022,Poland,Profiles of Occupational Burnout in the Group of Representatives of High-Risk Professions in Poland,"<title>Profiles of Occupational Burnout in the Group of Representatives of High-Risk Professions in Poland</title> <abstract>(1) Background: Working in a high-risk profession is associated with taking on a large responsibility and risking loss of health or life. These professions include, among others, air traffic controllers, firefighters, and ECDs. People working in these professions are particularly vulnerable to experiencing high levels of stress and developing professional burnout syndrome. The aim of the conducted research was to assess the external and internal differences in the intensity of occupational burnout dimensions among representatives of high-risk occupations and to distinguish burnout profiles among them. (2) Methods: The total number of participants working in high–risk occupations who took part in the study was N = 1239, including the following job positions: air traffic controllers (n = 107), firefighters (n = 580), and ECDs (n = 558). The respondents completed the following self-report questionnaires: a structured survey and the Link Burnout Questionnaire. The following statistical tests were performed: cluster analysis, analysis of variance, and chi-square test of independence. (3) Results: The highest intensity of burnout dimensions was presented by representatives of ECDs. Profiles reflecting the types of occupational burnout were distinguished. The representatives of air traffic controllers demonstrated the following profiles: 1—low risk of burnout with a component of psychophysical exhaustion; 2—exhausted with a moderate tendency to disap-pointment; 3—burned out, ineffective, and uninvolved. The profiles of the ECDs were: 4—engaged, with a reduced sense of effectiveness; 5—with a reduced sense of effectiveness; 6—burned out with a low sense of effectiveness. However, the profiles of the firefighters were: 7—not burned out; 8—at risk of burnout; 9—exhausted with a tendency towards disappointment. Individuals representing the various burnout profiles differed in terms of the severity of the dimensions of occupational burnout as well as sociodemographic and work-related characteristics. (4) Conclusions: The process of occupational burnout varies among people in various high-risk occupations and due to sociodemographic characteristics. The internal differentiation of people representing high-risk professions requires different psychological interventions and preventive measures. © 2022 by the authors.

According to statistical analysis, among the five human factors, physical fatigue, psychological stress, and the complacency of cabin crew had a positive impact on human errors. However, hurrying under time pressure and the distractions caused by external factors do not significantly affect human errors. Human errors have a negative impact on job crafting and mental health. This study analyzed the human factors influencing the cabin crew’s errors and revealed the importance of complacency, which was not covered in previous studies. Finally, the research implications, limitations, and future studies were discussed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</abstract>"

A questionnaire based on prior research was developed to identify factors of psychological anxiety among cabin crews as a result of COVID-19. The survey sample was limited to current cabin crews who experienced leave of absence due to COVID-19, and questionnaires were distributed to 201 crew members from 15 February to 15 April 2021. As a result of the analysis, the hypothesis that salary reduction, career stagnation, social perception, and employment insecurity have a significant effect on job self-esteem and job satisfaction was supported, while perceived infection risk and benefit reduction were rejected. This study found that psychological anxiety caused by COVID-19 affected cabin crew’s self-esteem and job satisfaction. These findings could aid in the development of strategies for effective airline human resource management to prevent psychological anxiety from creating stress and negatively affecting work. Furthermore, since the alert for the emergence of new viruses will not be eased in the future, this study will prevent psychological anxiety among cabin crews to cause job self-esteem and job dissatisfaction. © 2022 by the authors.

This study investigated the development of a model of psychological fatigue in ATCs in Indonesia, which affected their work stress levelsand quality of life. This cross-sectional, three-month study focused on 185 ATCs randomly selected from six AirNavs based on strata. The results indicated arelationship between work duration (p-value = 0.033) and stress on ATCs; additionally, a relationship between work time and the opportunity to meet personallife needs (p-value = 0.007) were found. Feelings of tiredness among ATCs manifested as a 'thirsty throat' feeling, and in saturation measurements, no respondents had experienced hypoxia in the two months of observation. Structural equation modeling showed that psychological fatigue had no direct effect onthe quality of life; however, it had an indirect and significant effect on work stress (p-value = 0.001). It can be concluded that the stress conditions experiencedby the ATCs have a palpable effect on feelings of fatigue and quality of life. © 2022 Universitas Indonesia, Faculty of public health.

2022,United Arab Emirates - United Kingdom,Integrating the HFACS Framework and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping for In-Flight Startle Causality Analysis,"<title>Integrating the HFACS Framework and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping for In-Flight Startle Causality Analysis</title> <abstract>This paper discusses the challenge of modeling in-flight startle causality as a precursor to enabling the development of suitable mitigating flight training paradigms. The article presents an overview of aviation human factors and their depiction in fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) framework. The approach exem-plifies system modeling with agents (causal factors), which showcase the problem space’s characteristics as fuzzy cognitive map elements (concepts). The FCM prototype enables four essential func-tions: explanatory, predictive, reflective, and strategic. This utility of fuzzy cognitive maps is due to their flexibility, objective representation, and effectiveness at capturing a broad understanding of a highly dynamic construct. Such dynamism is true of in-flight startle causality. On the other hand, FCMs can help to highlight potential distortions and limitations of use case representation to enhance future flight training paradigms. © 2022 by the authors.

2022,,Improving perioperative communication: Can labelled theatre caps play a role?,"<title>Improving perioperative communication: Can labelled theatre caps play a role?</title> <abstract>Studies have shown that approximately one third of operating room communications fail. This has a negative impact on patient safety, with half of all adverse events being attributed to communication failures. However, human factors have the capacity to protect patients. Aviation’s human factors strategies provide guidance for staff and are beneficial in the operating room. Currently, no intervention is universally applied to improve operating room communication and team performance. Closed loop communication, though poorly utilised, has been demonstrated to counteract communication errors, therefore protecting patient safety. In 2018, calls were made to take advantage of theatre caps to display staff member’s name and/or aid staff identification and communication. Further research into this initiative with larger participant numbers in a variety of specialities, especially emergency situations, and with greater scrutiny of infection prevention and control guidelines should be considered. © 2022, Australian College of Perioperative Nurses.

High speeds that modern aircraft develop during take-off, flight and landing place an additional strain on the organ of vision. Owing to its considerable practical implementation in air combat, the effect of +Gz acceleration on the organ of vision is considered increasingly important for research. Substantial changes in visual functions may occur during high acceleration onset rates. However, it is important for a pilot to maintain visual acuity in order to be able to monitor new functional displays for rapid orientation, scan the configuration of terrain, display of weapons systems and enemy aircraft and deal with additional issues of the complexity of spatial orientation. The aim of the investigation was to establish whether distance visual acuity in air force pilots and student pilots is affected when exposed to +Gz acceleration. Methods. The study was performed on a defined population consisting of 95 respondents from 21 to 45 years of age divided into two groups. The first group included 65 air force pilots and the second group comprised of 30 student pilots, all of whom were exposed to an acceleration of +5.5 Gz. The testing was performed in a human centrifuge, which mimics conditions of real Gz acceleration, in the Department of Biodynamics in Aero Medical Institute (Zemun, Serbia). We examined the obtained differences in distance visual acuity before and after exposure to acceleration. Results. After the testing, all respondents in the group of air force pilots had distance visual acuity of 1.0, while in the group of student pilots a statistically significant difference in distance visual acuity was observed after being exposed to +Gz acceleration. Conclusion. Transient changes in distant visual acuity were more pronounced in the group of student pilots in comparison with the changes in visual acuity in the air force pilots when exposed to the same acceleration values (+5Gz acceleration). Since change in distance visual acuity is the most sensitive physiological indicator when exposed to high acceleration, individual physiological pilot training in the human centrifuge increases tolerance to accelerations, which is important for flight safety in both peacetime and combat conditions. © 2022 Inst.

2022,Australia,Unraveling the Physiological Correlates of Mental Workload Variations in Tracking and Collision Prediction Tasks,"<title>Unraveling the Physiological Correlates of Mental Workload Variations in Tracking and Collision Prediction Tasks</title> <abstract>Modern work environments have extensive interactions with technology and greater cognitive complexity of the tasks, which results in human operators experiencing increased mental workload. Air traffic control operators routinely work in such complex environments, and we designed tracking and collision prediction tasks to emulate their elementary tasks. The physiological response to the workload variations in these tasks was elucidated to untangle the impact of workload variations experienced by operators. Electroencephalogram (EEG), eye activity, and heart rate variability (HRV) data were recorded from 24 participants performing tracking and collision prediction tasks with three levels of difficulty. Our findings indicate that variations in task load in both these tasks are sensitively reflected in EEG, eye activity and HRV data. Multiple regression results also show that operators' performance in both tasks can be predicted using the corresponding EEG, eye activity and HRV data. The results also demonstrate that the brain dynamics during each of these tasks can be estimated from the corresponding eye activity, HRV and performance data. Furthermore, the markedly distinct neurometrics of workload variations in the tracking and collision prediction tasks indicate that neurometrics can provide insights on the type of mental workload. These findings have applicability to the design of future mental workload adaptive systems that integrate neurometrics in deciding not just 'when' but also 'what' to adapt. Our study provides compelling evidence in the viability of developing intelligent closed-loop mental workload adaptive systems that ensure efficiency and safety in complex work environments. © 2001-2011 IEEE.</abstract>"

To do so, we administered the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). A total of 342 questionnaires were obtained, with the largest respondent age group being 41–50 years. The psychometric properties of the instrument were also evaluated, with an exploratory factor analysis revealing a unidimensional structure that explained 59.23% of the variance. The total score on the standard GHQ-12 was 4.54 ± 3.31 very close to the cut-off point established to determine psychological distress. The score increased among those unemployed and was also higher among pilots on furlough compared to those whose work situation was relatively normal. Furthermore, the reliability measured by the total Cronbach's alpha was above 0.8 of each across all employment status considered. These results show the desirability of conducting periodic psychological distress assessments of pilots so that effective measures can be implemented to ensure their psychological and socio-emotional well-being. Practitioner summary: This article evaluates psychological distress in a group of professionals that has received scant attention in the field. Moreover, it does so against the background of an atypical situation, evaluating the psychological distress suffered by pilots in different employment categories during the current severe crisis in the aviation sector.

2021,China,Prevalence and trigger factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders among male civil pilots in China,"<title>Prevalence and trigger factors of functional gastrointestinal disorders among male civil pilots in China</title> <abstract>Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common among the aircrew due to their arduous working environment. This study investigated the prevalence of FGIDs in Chinese male pilots and assessed the effects of trigger factors on the FGIDs. A cross-sectional study including 212 male pilots was performed in a Chinese large civil airline company. FGIDs were diagnosed according to the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The psychological performance, dietary pattern, sleep situation, and physical activity of the respondents were assessed. Logistic regression analysis and structural equation modeling were used to explore the association between these trigger factors and FGIDs. FGIDs were observed in 83 (39.22%) respondents, of which 31 (37.35%) had overlap syndromes. Age, flight level, flight time, high-salt food pattern, anxiety, and sleep performance were found to be associated with FGIDs (all P < 0.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that the flight level (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31–0.080), high-salt food pattern (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.28–4.16), and sleep performance (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.11–5.14) were the influencing factors associated with FGIDs. Structural equation modeling confirmed the correlations between FGIDs and the occupational, dietary, and psychological factors with a reasonable fit. The preventive strategies were necessitated according to occupational and psychological characteristics. © 2021, The Author(s).</abstract>"
2021,Poland,Perceived stress and burnout syndrome: A moderated mediation model of self-efficacy and psychological comfort among polish air traffic controllers,"<title>Perceived stress and burnout syndrome: A moderated mediation model of self-efficacy and psychological comfort among polish air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>How can one protect oneself against stress and burnout syndrome? What is the role of human cognitive processes? This study explores the moderated mediation effects of the trait of self-efficacy in a mode of perceived stress and burnout syndrome in a group of Polish air traffic controllers. The first aim of this study was to develop a better understanding of the construct of perceived stress. We proposed a latent variable, called psychological comfort, to clarify the role of self-efficacy in relation: stress and burnout. The second aim was to test the assumptions about the mediating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between stress and burnout via the level of psychological comfort. The most important aim was to investigate whether the direct and indirect associations between stress and burnout were moderated by the level of psychological comfort. For the study, self-report questionnaires were distributed to 609 active air traffic controllers from 18 air traffic control centers of the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (PANSA). Three hundred forty sets of questionnaires were returned (55.88%) of which 110 were correctly completed (return rate - 18.1%). We formulated 5 hypotheses. Two of them were confirmed: the indirect effect of perceived stress on occupational burnout via general self-efficacy was significant and the indirect relationship between perceived stress and occupational burnout would be different for air traffic controllers characterized by various levels of psychological comfort. The study emphasizes the role of certain human cognitive resources which may play a role in the relationship between stress and burnout: self-efficacy, perceived stress, and psychological comfort. There are important practical conclusions from the research. Knowing about the level of psychological comfort helps to plan better actions to protect against the negative impact of chronic stress on cognitive functions and against the development of clinical symptoms of burnout syndrome. © 2021 The Authors</abstract>"

Conventionally, the Aerospace Medicine Association and the British Thoracic Society recommend 2 weeks delay of air travel for a patient with resolved postoperative pneumothorax. They also label active pneumothorax as an absolute contraindication for commercial air travel. Such a delay always causes psychological and financial stress to patients and family who are far from home. Here, we report three patients with postoperative pneumothorax, who insisted on early air travel despite being informed of the possible consequences. © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

2021,China,Brain structural plasticity in visual and sensorimotor areas of airline pilots: A voxel-based morphometric study,"<title>Brain structural plasticity in visual and sensorimotor areas of airline pilots: A voxel-based morphometric study</title> <abstract>Background and Purpose: : Airline pilot is a highly specialized profession that requires to response quickly and accurately in the presence of a wide variety of visual information. Although functional imaging studies have employed virtual simulation to identify brain areas that underlie various flying-related tasks, little is known about the specific patterns of structural plasticity in the airline pilot's brain. Materials and Methods: In this study, we examined differences of gray matter and white matter volumes between 42 airline pilots and 39 non-pilots by using voxel-based morphometry, and further assessed the association between magnitude of structural alterations and flight time in the pilots. Results: We found significantly increased white matter volume in the cuneus area in the pilot group compared to the non-pilot group (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Using a relaxed threshold, it was also observed that the pilots had increased gray matter volume in the lingual gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, cuneus, and postcentral gyrus, and increased white matter volume in the postcentral area (p < 0.001, uncorrected). Moreover, the pilots’ flight time was positively correlated with gray matter volume in the postcentral gyrus and white matter volume in the cuneus area (p < 0.001, uncorrected). Conclusions: The morphological changes in specific visual and sensorimotor areas may provide airline pilots with neural efficiency in the visuo-motor processing related to flight. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"
2021,Australia,The Effects of Increased Visual Information on Cognitive Workload in a Helicopter Simulator,"<title>The Effects of Increased Visual Information on Cognitive Workload in a Helicopter Simulator</title> <abstract>Objective: To test the effects of enhanced display information (“symbology”) on cognitive workload in a simulated helicopter environment, using the detection response task (DRT). Background: Workload in highly demanding environments can be influenced by the amount of information given to the operator and consequently it is important to limit potential overload. Methods: Participants (highly trained military pilots) completed simulated helicopter flights, which varied in visual conditions and the amount of information given. During these flights, participants also completed a DRT as a measure of cognitive workload. Results: With more visual information available, pilots’ landing accuracy was improved across environmental conditions. The DRT is sensitive to changes in cognitive workload, with workload differences shown between environmental conditions. Increasing symbology appeared to have a minor effect on workload, with an interaction effect of symbology and environmental condition showing that symbology appeared to moderate workload. Conclusion: The DRT is a useful workload measure in simulated helicopter settings. The level of symbology-moderated pilot workload. The increased level of symbology appeared to assist pilots’ flight behavior and landing ability. Results indicate that increased symbology has benefits in more difficult scenarios. Applications: The DRT is an easily implemented and effective measure of cognitive workload in a variety of settings. In the current experiment, the DRT captures the increased workload induced by varying the environmental conditions, and provides evidence for the use of increased symbology to assist pilots. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"

2021,"Hong Kong - Iran, Islamic Republic of",Evaluating differences in cognitive functions and personality traits among air traffic controllers with and without error history,"<title>Evaluating differences in cognitive functions and personality traits among air traffic controllers with and without error history</title> <abstract>Given the growing rate of air transportation, it is necessary to consider the safety of the aviation industry. Air traffic control is one of the most sensitive and important jobs in the field of flight safety. Working in such a context requires the use of high levels of cognitive functions, which can be impaired or reduced in speed and accuracy under pressure and stress. Another issue is that cognitive functions interact with non-cognitive factors, one of which is personality traits. Through using a causal-comparative method, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive functions like situational awareness, short-term memory, sustained attention and planning ability, and personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and adventurousness, on air traffic controllers’ human error by controlling the effect of age. For this purpose, five tests were selected from the Vienna Test System, namely MR, CORSI, DAUF, TOL-F, and EPP6, to measure controllers’ cognitive functions and personality traits. By convenience sampling, 37 controllers from the air control center participated in the tests. Excluding outliers, the groups were as follows: 16 controllers with error history and 15 controllers without error history. To control the effect of age on cognitive functions and personality traits, the groups’ data were compared using the covariance analysis. According to the results, there is a difference between groups in situational awareness (sig = 0.008, P ≤ 0.05) and sustained attention (sig = 0.01, P ≤ 0.05), with error-free controllers showing higher scores in these functions. However, in other cognitive functions that were studied, namely short-term memory (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05) and planning ability (sig = 0.8, P ≤ 0.05), no difference was shown between the two groups. Moreover, the study of personality traits showed that controllers with errors differ from controllers without errors (sig = 0.02, P ≤ 0.05), but in emotionality (sig = 0.7, P ≤ 0.05) and adventurousness (sig = 0.6, P ≤ 0.05) there are no differences between the two groups. With these results in mind, efforts can be made to minimize potential errors in sensitive occupations such as air traffic control by using cognitive and personality screening tools. © 2021</abstract>"

We also analyzed the effect of empathy on variables such as team performance, organizational atmosphere, and instances of irregularity. We analyzed 230 samples obtained from an online questionnaire and convenience sampling of full-service domestic and international carriers in South Korea. A structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that uncommonly attentive behavior, courteous behavior, connecting behavior, and information-sharing behavior showed a positive effect on empathy among colleagues, which in turn positively influenced team performance, organizational atmosphere, and possible irregularities. Moreover, we found that the presence of participants’ closest colleagues within the same team did not moderate the relationship between rapport-building and empathic behavior between airline crew members. Our study has important implications for crew members’ dignity and protection from emotional labor while working in high-pressure environments. Our findings can be used to revise the airline industry’s crew management guidelines and improve the crew’s psychological health and quality of life. © 2021 by the authors.

2021,Croatia - United States,Prediction of Task Performance from Physiological Features of Stress Resilience,"<title>Prediction of Task Performance from Physiological Features of Stress Resilience</title> <abstract>In this paper, we investigate the potential of generic physiological features of stress resilience in predicting air traffic control (ATC) candidates' performance in a highly-stressful low-fidelity ATC simulator scenario. Stress resilience is highlighted as an important occupational factor that influences the performance and well-being of air traffic control officers (ATCO). Poor stress management, besides the lack of skills, can be a direct cause of poor performance under stress, both in the selection process of ATCOs and later in the workplace. 40 ATC candidates, within the final stages of their selection process, underwent a stimulation paradigm for elicitation and assessment of various generic task-unrelated physiological features, related to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), acoustic startle response (ASR) and the physiological allostatic response, which are all recognized as relevant psychophysiological markers of stress resilience. The multimodal approach included analysis of electrocardiography, electromyography, electrodermal activity and respiration. We make advances in computational methodology for assessment of physiological features of stress resilience, and investigate the predictive power of the obtained feature space in a binary classification problem: prediction of high- vs. low-performance on the developed ATC simulator. Our novel approach yields a relatively high 78.16% classification accuracy. These results are discussed in the context of prior work, while considering study limitations and proposing directions for future work. © 2013 IEEE.</abstract>"
2021,Russian Federation,Aviation psychology: Development stage in science and education,"<title>Aviation psychology: Development stage in science and education</title> <abstract>Introduction. Aviation psychology is a sphere of psychology that makes a significant contribution to ensuring aviation safety.

2021,United States,In-flight Medical Emergencies,"<title>In-flight Medical Emergencies</title> <abstract>In 2018, approximately 2.8 million passengers flew in and out of U.S. airports per day. Twenty-four to 130 in-flight medical emergencies are estimated to occur per 1 million passengers; however, there is no internationally agreed-upon recording or classification system. Up to 70% of in-flight emergencies are managed by the cabin crew without additional assistance. If a health care volunteer is requested, medical professionals should consider if they are in an appropriate condition to render aid, and then identify themselves to cabin crew, perform a history and physical examination, and inform the cabin crew of clinical impressions and recommendations. An aircraft in flight is a physically constrained and resource-limited environment. When needed, an emergency medical kit and automated external defibrillator are available on all U.S. aircraft with at least one flight attendant and a capacity for 30 or more passengers. Coordinated communication with the pilot, any available ground-based medical resources, and flight dispatch is needed if aircraft diversion is recommended. In the United States, medical volunteers are generally protected by the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998. There is no equivalent law governing international travel, and legal jurisdiction depends on the patient's and medical professional's countries of citizenship and the country in which the aircraft is registered.</abstract>"
2021,United States,Evaluation of conflict-resolution policies on controller taskload,"<title>Evaluation of conflict-resolution policies on controller taskload</title> <abstract>In an effort to maintain safety while satisfying growing air traffic demand, air navigation service providers are considering the inclusion of advisory systems to identify potential conflicts and propose resolution commands for the air traffic controller to verify and issue to aircraft. To understand the potential workload implications of introducing advisory conflict-detection and resolution tools, this paper examines a metric of controller taskload: how many resolution commands an air traffic controller issues under the guidance of an advisory system. Through a simulation study, the research presented here evaluates how the underlying protocol of a conflict-resolution tool affects the controller taskload (system demands) associated with the conflict-resolution process, and implicitly the controller workload (physical and psychological demands). Ultimately, evidence indicates that there is significant flexibility in the design of conflict-resolution algorithms supporting an advisory system. © 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics</abstract>"

Methods: A parallel-group (intervention and control) study was conducted amongst 79 airline pilots over a 17-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention group (n = 38) received a personalized sleep, dietary, and physical activity (PA) program. The control group (n = 41) received no intervention. Outcome measures for sleep, fruit and vegetable intake, PA, and subjective health were measured though an online survey before and after the 17-week period. The changes in outcome measures were used to determine the efficacy of the intervention. Results: Significant main effects for time × group were found for International Physical Activity Questionnaire-walk (p = 0.02) and for all other outcome measures (p < 0.01). The intervention group significantly improved in sleep duration (p < 0.01; d = 1.35), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (p < 0.01; d = 1.14), moderate-to-vigorous PA (p < 0.01; d = 1.44), fruit and vegetable intake (p < 0.01; d = 2.09), Short Form 12v2 physical score (p < 0.01; d = 1.52), and Short Form 12v2 mental score (p < 0.01; d = 2.09). The control group showed significant negative change for sleep duration, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, and Short Form 12v2 mental score (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Results provide preliminary evidence that a 3-component healthy sleep, eating, and PA intervention elicit improvements in health behaviors and perceived subjective health in pilots and may improve quality of life during an unprecedented global pandemic. © 2021</abstract>"
2021,"Korea, Republic of",Developing a stigma scale for the workplace: focus on an airline cabin crew,"<title>Developing a stigma scale for the workplace: focus on an airline cabin crew</title> <abstract>The purpose of this study is to develop metrics for stigma-producing factors by conducting a survey among stigma inflictors, that is, people who participate in the stigmatization of others. This study attempted to develop a stigma measurement scale for service industry workers. This study focused airline cabin crew members in accordance with a seven-step scale development procedure to derive stigma measurement variables. As a result, the stigma scale developed in this study consists of 6 factors (work ability, conscientiousness, selfishness, work ethics, appearance, neuroticism) containing 28 measurement items. This study indicates the need to find countermeasures that can reduce stigmatization of employees within organizations. At a personal level, the practical implication is to prevent stigmatization from occurring within the organization by improving the perception of stigma by cabin crew within the airline organization. At the organizational level, the practical implication is to analyze and reduce the factors of social stigma that negatively affect organizational performance. © 2021 by the authors.

2021,United States,Personality Traits That Distinguish Special Operations Female Aircrew,"<title>Personality Traits That Distinguish Special Operations Female Aircrew</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) female aircrew represent a small group of military personnel in challenging high-risk, high-demand professions. Personality characteristics may play a key role in distinguishing those women who pursue a career as a special operations aircrew member and succeed in this pursuit. Having access to normative personality data can potentially support psychologists in assessing AFSOC female aircrew and subsequently making informed recommendations to leadership. METHODS: A total of 586 AFSOC aircrew trainees—58 (9.9%) women and 528 (90.1%) men—completed a series of computer-based psychological tests to assess cognitive ability and personality traits. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences between female AFSOC aircrew and female civilians on four of the five NEO Personality Inventory domains: Neuroticism (M 5 74.9 vs. M 5 87.1), Extraversion (M 5 123.7 vs. M 5 112.8), Openness to Experience (M 5 122.6 vs. M 5 111.0), and Conscientiousness (M 5 136.0 vs. M 5 120.6), respectively. The comparison between female AFSOC aircrew and male AFSOC aircrew revealed significant differences across three of the five domains: Neuroticism (M 5 74.9 vs. M 5 65.1), Openness to Experience (M 5 122.6 vs. M 5 115.0), and Agreeableness (M 5 119.6 vs. M 5 112.7), respectively. DISCUSSION: Implications for assessment and interpretation of psychological testing are discussed. This paper provides a unique perspective and insight into those who pursue and excel in this career field. Identifying specific personality traits in our AFSOC female aircrew allows for tailored care and support when evaluating readiness in special operations aircrew for optimizing performance. © © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA</abstract>"

Furthermore, we verified (4) the moderating effect of cabin crew’s previous overseas experience on the relationship between cross-cultural adjustment competency and turnover intention. MBTI-Form M test and a survey questionnaire were distributed to 185 Korean cabin crew members in Middle Eastern airlines, and 172 valid datapoints were used for analysis. It was revealed that the cabin crew members showed significantly different levels of cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, and coping competency depending on their personality traits. Further-more, those with higher cross-cultural adjustment competency and stress coping are more likely to have positive mental health, which also had an influence on lowering their turnover intention. Occupational competency had no significant association with mental health; however, it directly affects turnover intention. The findings will contribute not only to career plan guidelines for cabin crew aspirants, but also to airlines’ recruitment strategies as well as human resources management in aviation industry. © 2021 by the authors.

2021,France - United States,Analysing human activity development through (work)spaces in a human-centered design project for commercial airline pilots,"<title>Analysing human activity development through (work)spaces in a human-centered design project for commercial airline pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper conducts a co-design framework, thanks to different kinds of interviews with expert pilots in different space contexts for each stage of the technical development of the system. Design/methodology/approach: To speak about the question of “spaces” and especially spaces in the design process, this paper is focussed on the transdisciplinary design research for commercial airline pilots. This design research combined a “Human-Centred Design” approach (Boy, 2015) with an occupational psychology, including a “Clinic of Activity” perspective (Kloëtzer et al., 2016). It integrates experts within the research process to design a new technological tool for indicating weather conditions in flight (Boulnois, 2018). Findings: This study explains how the crossed self-confrontation interview under special space conditions allows dialogue to take place between the designers and the pilots for imagining the future workplace by using an emergent workspace. Practical implications: The physical, psychological and social “space” conditions were worked on throughout the design process – including during the work analysis and design testing phases – and were revisited. Originality/value: In this way, the occupational psychologist organised the framework for dialogue about the present situation and future workspaces, to anticipate changes in work organisation, enhance inter-professional collaboration and, finally, increase health and safety benefits for pilots, and potentially other workers, at the same time. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2021,Australia - China,The Difficulty to Break a Relational Complexity Network Can Predict Air Traffic Controllers’ Mental Workload and Performance in Conflict Resolution,"<title>The Difficulty to Break a Relational Complexity Network Can Predict Air Traffic Controllers’ Mental Workload and Performance in Conflict Resolution</title> <abstract>Objective: To test the network disentangling model for explaining air traffic controllers’ (ATCos) conflict resolution performance. The network rigidity index (NRI), and the steps to break the relational complexity network following a central-available-node-first rule, was hypothesized to explain the overall task demand, whereas marginal-effort-decrease rule was expected to explain the actual operational outcome. Background: Understanding the conflict resolution process of ATCos is important for aviation safety and efficiency. However, linear models are insufficient. We proposed a new model that ATCos behavior can be largely considered as a process to break the relational complexity network, in which nodes represent the aircraft while links represent the cognitive complexity to understand the aircraft dyad relationship. Method: Twenty-one professional ATCos completed 27 conflict resolution scenarios that varied in the NRI and other control variables. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to understand the influence of the NRI on the number of interventions, mental workload, and unresolved rate. A cross-validation was performed to evaluate the predictive power of the model. Results: NRI influenced ATCos intervention number in a curvilinear manner, which further leads to ATCo’s mental workload. The deviance between the number of interventions and the NRI was strongly linked with unresolved rate. Cross-validation suggests that the models predictions are robust. Conclusion: The network disentangling model provides a useful theory-driven way to explain controllers’ conflict resolution workload and other important performance outcomes such as intervention probability. Application: The proposed model can potentially be used for workload management, sector design, and intelligent decision support tool development. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"

The Aircrew Conditioning Programme and direct access physiotherapy exist to minimise the impact on military capability, but a population specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) is required to investigate the effectiveness of these. We aimed to explore the experiences of flight-related neck pain to inform the content validity and development of a population specific PROM. Methods Qualitative semistructured interviews combining phenomenological and grounded theory methods, reported using Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines. A purposive sample of 10 fast jet pilots with neck pain was recruited. Concept elicitation interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim along with field notes. Data analysis involved subject and methodological expertise used a concept elicitation approach. Results Participants included 10 male fast jet pilots, age 34.7 years. Identified themes included: (1) physical symptoms associated with flying activities; (2) occupational effects revealed modifications of flying, or suboptimal' performance owing to neck pain; (3) psychological effects revealed feelings or worry and (4) social and activity effects showed impact on out of work time. Conclusion Population-specific occupational, psychological and social factors should be considered alongside physical symptoms when managing neck pain in military aircrew. Findings support the development of a PROM specifically designed for military aircrew with neck pain. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

Methods: This cross-sectional study participated 12 experienced male pilots (age = 33.08 (5.21)) from the Spanish Air Force. Participants had to complete a real and a simulated flight mission randomly. The heart rate variability (HRV), anxiety, self-confidence, and rating of perceived exertion were collected before and after both manoeuvres, and HRV was also collected during both simulated and real flights. Results: When studying the acute effects of real and simulated flights, the mean heart rate, the R-to-R interval, the cognitive anxiety and the perceived exertion were significantly impacted only by real flights. Fur-thermore, significant differences in the mean heart rate and RR interval were found when compared to the acute effects of real and simulated flights (with higher acute effects observed in real flights). Additionally, when compared the HRV values during simulated and real flights, significant differences were observed in the RR and heart rate mean (with lower RR interval and higher heart rate mean observed during real flights). Conclusion: Real flights significantly reduced the RR interval and cognitive anxiety while increased the heart rate mean and the rating of perceived exertion, whereas simulated flights did not induce any significant change in the autonomic modulation. © 2021 by the authors.

Diagnoses were classified according to the format and definitions laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1178/2011 Part Med. results: Analyzed were 82,435 cases assessed by 6 NAAs. Of these cases, 2.1% were assessed as unfit to fly. Frequent causes for grounding a pilot were cardiovascular (19%), psychiatric (11%), neurological (10%), and psychological (9%). Cardiovascular conditions were the most frequent cause for grounding in the older age groups, with 21% in the age 51-60 cohort, 28% in the age 61-65 cohort, and 48% in those beyond 65 yr. Psychiatric and psychological diagnoses were most frequent in the age 20-40 cohort. discussion: Cardiovascular conditions were the most frequent cause for grounding. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are associated with modifiable risk factors. tackling these risk factors gives aeromedical examiners the opportunity to improve the health of pilots and reduce CVD-related flight safety risks by reducing the number of pilots at risk of in-flight incapacitation. the mandatory periodical medical examination of pilots provides an excellent framework for risk prevention and follow-upofpreventivemeasure s. © 2021. the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.

2021,Colombia - Spain,Effects of Hypoxia on Selected Psychophysiological Stress Responses of Military Aircrew,"<title>Effects of Hypoxia on Selected Psychophysiological Stress Responses of Military Aircrew</title> <abstract>There is a lack of information on the psychophysiological response of pilots under hypoxic conditions. The study of the physiological, psychological, cardiorespiratory, neurological, behavioural, sensory, and cognitive symptoms that may appear during training in hypobaric chambers is essential to optimize the training processes of aircrew members. Thus, the present study is aimed at analyzing the psychophysiological responses of aircrew members in an incremental hypoxia training protocol. Psychophysiological responses of 44 aircrew members (34 males and 10 females) in an incremental hypoxia training protocol (3 minutes at 0 meters, 8 minutes at 5,000 meters, and maximum time at 7500 meters) were measured. Results suggested that the incremental hypoxia training protocol did not affect cortical arousal and handgrip strength; however, it increased the sympathetic tone, perceived stress, perceived effort, and heart rate and decreased forced expiratory volume and blood oxygen saturation. Thus, we concluded that acute hypoxic hypobaric exposure leads to decreased parasympathetic tone, blood oxygen saturation, and maximal spirometry values, without negatively affecting handgrip strength and cortical arousal. This information will lead to find specific training systems that meet the real needs of aircrew. © 2021 A. Bustamante-Sánchez et al.</abstract>"
2021,United States,Predictors and protective factors for suicide ideation across remotely piloted aircraft career fields,"<title>Predictors and protective factors for suicide ideation across remotely piloted aircraft career fields</title> <abstract>The US Air Force remote warrior community comprises several career fields including remotely piloted aircraft pilots and intelligence, cyber, and sensor operators. The crews are responsible for working seamlessly together to provide 24/7 real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and precision-strike weapons capabilities for a wide range of global combat operations. Due to the rapid increase in global demands and operational tempo, there is growing concern from military leadership about the impact of operational stress on the health and psychological well-being of remote warriors. Previous assessments from 2011 and 2015 have demonstrated a significant increase in the reported rates of operators experiencing suicide ideation. The current study examined two protective factors expected to reduce the risk of suicide ideation–team member social support and leader social support. A total of 905 active duty remote warriors participated in occupational health assessments conducted in 2018. Risk factors for suicide ideation included being unmarried, worsening relationship problems, occupational burnout, and increased operational stress. Results indicated that team member and leader social support were significant protective factors for shift workers and those who reported being less likely to seek mental healthcare. Implications of the findings, intervention recommendations, and directions for future research are discussed. © 2021 Neurostat Analytical Solutions.</abstract>"
2021,United States,Plan B for Eliminating Mode Confusion: An Interpreter Display,"<title>Plan B for Eliminating Mode Confusion: An Interpreter Display</title> <abstract>For more than three decades, aviation human factor researchers have analyzed the autoflight system interface (autopilot, autothrottle, flight management system) and articulated its flaws; the design issues are well known. More importantly, autoflight “mode confusion” has contributed to airplane accidents and incidents. A handful of design efforts have produced new interface designs that succeeded in removing or reducing pilot confusion and errors. Despite these efforts, interfaces on the most recent jet transports have changed little, and mode confusion continues to contribute to safety events. The failure to improve interface design is due to economic factors, such as maintaining common type ratings, and reducing certification risk and training costs. This paper reviews previous re-designs as the primary input to a proposed design for an “interpreter” display. The proposed display, implemented as a retrofitted supplementary display, depicts actual autoflight system behavior–What’s it doing now? What will it do next?–in a simple, graphical format.

2021,Ireland,"Pilot Work Related Stress (WRS), Effects on Wellbeing and Mental Health, and Coping Methods","<title>Pilot Work Related Stress (WRS), Effects on Wellbeing and Mental Health, and Coping Methods</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between sources of work-related stress (WRS) for pilots, effects on wellbeing, and coping mechanisms. Background: Recent studies have measured depression levels in pilots but not the relationship between depression levels and coping strategies. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted with commercial pilots. A regression model was advanced to analyze the relationship between each frequency level of each coping strategy and PHQ-9 Scores, and the Odds ratio was interpreted. Results: Sources of WRS impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Not all pilots are suffering. Over half met threshold for mild depression. Nearly 60% are using coping mechanisms to manage WRS and its impact on wellbeing. Pilots using coping mechanisms such as sleep management, taking physical exercise, and diet management were found to have lower depression severity levels. The findings of this study underscore the need to advance new tools to enable pilot self-management of their health and wellbeing. This includes new training tools, enhanced checklists, and new digital tools to support wellbeing awareness, stress coping, and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit. Conclusions: Airlines and pilots need the right tools to safeguard the wellbeing and mental fitness of pilots and ensure flight safety. Pilots, airlines, and aviation regulators can learn from the existing use of coping strategies by pilots. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

With the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, he was treated based on the national protocol and stayed in the home quarantine for two weeks. Having been released for flying, he faced nausea, vomiting, facial cold sweat and pallor, dizziness, and imbalance that eventually caused flying avoidance during the three first flights. He has never had a similar problem or any predisposing factors during his pilot's training and afterwards. All the probable reasons ruled out after a complete assessment. Following the diagnosis of moderate airsickness, he was abstained from flying and treated with different prevention and rehabilitation techniques. None of them had enough clinical efficacies, applying the United States Air Force Preventive Airsickness Protocol as the last choice. Despite the three separate consecutive therapeutic courses, no significant clinical improvement was observed, and could not return to fly, yet. That is the first reported case of intractable airsickness in a flight crew that may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020</abstract>"
2021,China,Health-related quality of life in pilots of a Chinese commercial airline,"<title>Health-related quality of life in pilots of a Chinese commercial airline</title> <abstract>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is currently an important issue in the medical industry. However, data on HRQOL in commercial airline pilots are lacking. This study aimed to investigate HRQOL and its related factors in a sample of commercial pilots. A purposive sample of 373 participants was recruited from a Chinese Commercial Airline. The median (IQR) score for physical health, psychological health and social relationship were 64.3 (75–53.6), 62.5 (70.8–54.2) and 75 (75–58.3), respectively. The mean (SD) score for Environment was 62.2 (16). After controlling for demographics, the multiple linear regression analyses showed that physical activity, fruit intake and vegetable intake were positively correlated with HRQOL score (p <.05), while time-zone flights, smoking, alcohol drinking and being dyslipidemic showed a negative correlation with HRQOL score (p <.05). Healthcare providers should consider time-zone flights, behavioral factors and dyslipidemia when planning related health promotion and disease prevention programs for commercial pilots in the future. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,Turkey,Dose safety motivation mediate the effect of psychological contract of safety on flight attendants' safety performance outcomes?: A social exchange perspective,"<title>Dose safety motivation mediate the effect of psychological contract of safety on flight attendants' safety performance outcomes?: A social exchange perspective</title> <abstract>This study proposes and tests a conceptual model that investigates the mediating effect of safety motivation linking psychological contract of safety (PCS) as manifested by employer obligations of safety and employee obligations of safety to safety violations and safety creative performance (SCP). Data were collected from a sample of flight attendants with two weeks time lag in Iran. Underpinned by social exchange theory, the results of structural equation modeling revealed that safety motivation fully mediates the simultaneous effects of PCS indicators on safety violations and SCP. Specifically, indicators of PCS jointly enhance safety motivation. In turn, safety motivation reduces safety violations, while enhancing SCP. Theoretical and practical implications evoked from the results advance existing knowledge of organizationally social interactions in promoting safety and the motivational mechanism through which PCS predicts employees' safety performance outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2020,"Korea, Republic of",Verbal Reports’ Influence on Pilot Flight Performance and Mental Stress Under Spatial Disorientation,"<title>Verbal Reports’ Influence on Pilot Flight Performance and Mental Stress Under Spatial Disorientation</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Circumstances in flight can adversely affect a pilot's spatial abilities and lead to spatial disorientation (SD), increasing the potential for fatal accidents. To systematically understand the impact of SD, it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze pilots’ flight performance and mental stress, and to verify the effectiveness of verbal reports (VR) in enabling pilots to deal with an SD situation. This study investigated the effects of VR execution and type of SD on flight performance and mental stress. METHODS: SD simulation experiments were conducted on 30 Air Force fighter pilots (15 in the VR group and 15 in the non-VR group) with electrocardiography (ECG) sensors attached. The pilots gave their VRs by immediately verbalizing their attention to instrument information and six potentially disorientating scenarios were implemented in each flight phase. Flight performance was analyzed using instructor evaluation and self-evaluation scores, and mental stress was measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and perceived distress score. RESULTS: In maintaining flight performance, the VR group, respectively, had 8% and 10% higher scores for altitude and speed than the non-VR group. The self-evaluation scores were lowest for Coriolis, while Graveyard Spin was scored lowest in the instructor evaluations. Regarding mental stress, the VR group tended to have higher HFs and lower LF/HF ratios among HRV measures than the non-VR group, and an 11% lower perceived distress score. The highest perceived distress score was for Coriolis. DISCUSSION: We suggest that pilots can be assisted to understand and overcome SD situations through VR. © 2020</abstract>"

Prolonged periods in space will not only present physical and psychological challenges to the astronauts, but also pose risks concerning the medical treatment capabilities of the crew. So far, no guideline exists for the treatment of severe medical emergencies in microgravity. We, as a international group of researchers related to the field of aerospace medicine and critical care, took on the challenge and developed a an evidence-based guideline for the arguably most severe medical emergency – cardiac arrest. Methods: After the creation of said international group, PICO questions regarding the topic cardiopulmonary resuscitation in microgravity were developed to guide the systematic literature research. Afterwards a precise search strategy was compiled which was then applied to “MEDLINE”. Four thousand one hundred sixty-five findings were retrieved and consecutively screened by at least 2 reviewers. This led to 88 original publications that were acquired in full-text version and then critically appraised using the GRADE methodology. Those studies formed to basis for the guideline recommendations that were designed by at least 2 experts on the given field. Afterwards those recommendations were subject to a consensus finding process according to the DELPHI-methodology. Results: We recommend a differentiated approach to CPR in microgravity with a division into basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) similar to the Earth-based guidelines. In immediate BLS, the chest compression method of choice is the Evetts-Russomano method (ER), whereas in an ALS scenario, with the patient being restrained on the Crew Medical Restraint System, the handstand method (HS) should be applied. Airway management should only be performed if at least two rescuers are present and the patient has been restrained. A supraglottic airway device should be used for airway management where crew members untrained in tracheal intubation (TI) are involved. Discussion: CPR in microgravity is feasible and should be applied according to the Earth-based guidelines of the AHA/ERC in relation to fundamental statements, like urgent recognition and action, focus on high-quality chest compressions, compression depth and compression-ventilation ratio. However, the special circumstances presented by microgravity and spaceflight must be considered concerning central points such as rescuer position and methods for the performance of chest compressions, airway management and defibrillation. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract>"
2020,India - Myanmar,Automated Cognitive Workload Assessment Using Logical Teaching Learning-Based Optimization and PROMETHEE Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach,"<title>Automated Cognitive Workload Assessment Using Logical Teaching Learning-Based Optimization and PROMETHEE Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach</title> <abstract>Cognitive workload assessment plays an important role to examine the mental status of brain for emergency situations faced by air traffic controllers, military personals and many more. It is also significant for brain disorder diagnosis and psychological health monitoring. Mental workload induced by various factors needs to be critically examined for better decisions. This paper presents an automated model for cognitive workload assessment to provide accurate categorization on intensity of workload induced by multitasking situations. Statistical wavelets corresponding to brain frequencies act as features for categorization task. The brain analysis needs technical expertise to identify the relevant information but, due to lack of sufficient number of experts, feature selection model helps to identify the relevant features responsible to categorize cognitive workload. Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO) method has been modified using 'Logical Operators' for binary feature selection problem in the current study and evaluated based on different parameters. Results on Logical TLBO reached upto 100% for binary and multiclass classification of cognitive workload. The results also show the proposed method is converging in minimum iteration for multiclass cognitive workload. PROMETHEE based multi-criteria decision-making approach has adopted for ranking of algorithm to select the best algorithm when multiple alternatives are available. Based on study of current literature, this approach appears to be first time implemented to provide ranking of optimization algorithms. The PROMETHEE method also suggests that the Logical TLBO is best among all the other compared approaches. © 2001-2012 IEEE.</abstract>"
2020,Ireland - Netherlands,“Flying on empty”–effects of sleep deprivation on pilot performance,"<title>“Flying on empty”–effects of sleep deprivation on pilot performance</title> <abstract>Today’s flight operations work on pressurised 24/7 timetables. As a result, sleep loss and fatigue are becoming commonplace among pilots and pose a serious threat to flight safety. This study examined the effects of 24 h’ sleep deprivation on a variety of psychological measures, cognitive performance tasks and simulated flight. Seven commercial airline pilots completed the Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check (SPC), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), Dual-N-Back, Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and aviation-specific mathematical calculations as well as a computerised flight simulator task, during which participants were required to answer mid-flight fuel calculations and situational awareness questions (SA). Testing occurred at 3 hour intervals during the final 12 hours of a 24 hour period of continuous wakefulness. Significant impairments in performance were observed on nearly all tests following 20 hours continuous wakefulness. Flying performance was not significantly impaired. Changes in flight performance were found to be consistent with changes in situational awareness. Overall findings showed impairments in mood, cognition and flying performance following 20 hours continuous wakefulness. SA indicates promise as a potential indicator of changes in flying performance as a result of sleep deprivation and fatigue. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2020,Turkey,Handling the pseudo pilot assignment problem in air traffic control training by using NASA TLX,"<title>Handling the pseudo pilot assignment problem in air traffic control training by using NASA TLX</title> <abstract>Simulator courses play an important role in a department training air traffic controllers (ATCOs). One of the most important elements of these courses is a pseudo-pilot (PP) who has active tasks during simulator training. At Eskisehir Technical University (ESTU) PP assignments are made manually to meet the demand of related courses by considering the availability of PP. Even where it is attempted to assign each PP equally in terms of period, personal workloads differ due to the different psychological (mental) and physiological requirements of the simulator tasks. In this study, the PP assignment problem is investigated using mixed-integer programming (MIP). For this purpose, firstly, an equal period assignment to pilots was attempted with a mathematical model, called the Equality of Periods Model (EPM). Then, simulator tasks were weighted using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and an Equality of Workload Model (EWLM) was created based on these weights. Finally, these models were combined to make fair assignments with the Fair Model (FM). The results indicate that the proposed models significantly reduce the differences of workload and working period compared to manual assignment (MA). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2020,"Taiwan, Province of China",Comparison of hypobaric hypoxia symptoms between a recalled exposure and a current exposure,"<title>Comparison of hypobaric hypoxia symptoms between a recalled exposure and a current exposure</title> <abstract>Background Aircrew members are required to attend hypoxia awareness training regularly to strengthen their memory of their personal hypoxia symptoms by undergoing training inside a hypobaric chamber. The aim of this study was to examine the association between hypoxia symptoms experienced during two training sessions that were 4 years apart. Methods This was a crossover study to compare hypoxia symptoms and self-reported physiological effects of trapped gas between a previous training session and a current training session in an altitude chamber. The subjects were military crew members who undertook a 25,000-feet refresher training course in 2018. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain the target information before and during hypoxia exposure. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results A total of 341 trainees participated in this survey and completely filled out the questionnaire. Gastrointestinal tract discomfort caused by the expansion of trapped gas was the main physiological reaction during the previous and current training sessions. Frequently reported symptoms were poor concentration (30.5%), impaired cognitive function (20.5%), visual disturbances (16.4%), hot flashes (15.8%), and paresthesia (12.6%) during both exposures. However, the proportions of participants reporting poor concentration (P = 0.378) and visual disturbances (P = 0.594) were not significantly different between the recalled and current training sessions. The five most common symptoms among the subjects with less than 1,000 flight hours were poor concentration (29.8%), visual disturbance (27.3%), impaired cognitive function (14.9%), dizziness/lightheadedness (11.6%), and hot flashes (9.9%), which overlapped substantially with the symptoms reported by other subjects. The occurrence of those five most common symptoms in the group with more than 1,000 flight hours did not significantly differ between the recalled training session and the current training session. Conclusions The most common hypoxia symptoms reported were similar between the recalled and current training sessions in an environment with a low oxygen concentration. This finding was also clearly affected by the duration of flight experience. Moreover, GI effects of the expansion of trapped gas were commonly observed at low atmospheric pressure. © 2020 Tu et al.

2020,Czechia,Statistical evaluation of pilot's behavior models parameters connected to military flight training,"<title>Statistical evaluation of pilot's behavior models parameters connected to military flight training</title> <abstract>The paper discusses the possibilities of objective assessment of military flight training quality based on statistical evaluation of pilot's behavior models parameters. For these purposes, the pilots' responses to non-standard flight situations were measured by using a fixed-base and a moving-base engineering flight simulator. Tens of military pilots at different training stages were tested. By exploiting real-life tests, we established that the given pilot models provide sufficiently accurate approximation of realistic human responses. Importantly, the models are relatively easy to use, and the individual parameters can be unambiguously interpreted, i.e., the time constants of the pilot behavior model are obtainable, representing the pilot's current psychological and physiological state of mind. The parameters lay in the defined ranges, and they characterize the ability of the human/pilot to adapt to a controlled dynamic system. Consequently, a fundamental statistical analysis based on pilot's behavioral model parameters was conducted, using the acquired test data representing the pilot's behavior during repeated measuring. The initial results indicate the possibility to use the results for objective assessment the military flight training level. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

2020,France,A Curvilinear Effect of Mental Workload on Mental Effort and Behavioral Adaptability: An Approach With the Pre-Ejection Period,"<title>A Curvilinear Effect of Mental Workload on Mental Effort and Behavioral Adaptability: An Approach With the Pre-Ejection Period</title> <abstract>Objective: We tested Hancock and Szalma’s mental workload model, which has never been experimentally validated at a global level with the measure of the pre-ejection period (PEP), an index of beta-adrenergic sympathetic impact. Background: Operators adapt to mental workload. When mental workload level increases, behavioral and physiological adaptability intensifies to reduce the decline in performance. However, if the mental workload exceeds an intermediate level, behavioral and physiological adaptability will decrease to protect individuals from excessive perturbations. This decrease is associated with a change in behavioral strategies and disengagement. Method: The experimental task was a modified Fitts’ task used in Hancock and Caird. Five levels of task difficulty were computed. Behavioral and physiological adaptability was indexed by the performance with speed–accuracy trade-off and PEP reactivity. Results: A curvilinear effect of task difficulty on PEP reactivity was significant, with high reactivity at the intermediate level but low reactivity at other levels. We observed a linear effect of task difficulty on error rate and a curvilinear effect on movement time. A decline in performance was noted up to the intermediate level, with a speed–accuracy trade-off above this level showing a faster movement time. Conclusion: We observed for the first time behavioral and physiological adaptability as a function of mental workload. Application: The results have important implications for the modeling of mental workload, particularly in the context of the performance-sensitive domain (car driving and air traffic control). They can help guide the design of human–computer interaction to maximize adaptive behavior, that is, the “comfort zone.” © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. Objective To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. Design An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. Setting Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) Participants 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. Results The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p = 0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p = 0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively). The aircrews were satisfied with the protocol and provided several practical suggestions. Conclusion The protocol was well received by the passengers and aircrews of the repatriation flights with some suggestions for improvement. © 2020 Pongpirul et al.

2020,Ireland,Interventions to support the management of work-related stress (WRS) and wellbeing/mental health issues for commercial pilots,"<title>Interventions to support the management of work-related stress (WRS) and wellbeing/mental health issues for commercial pilots</title> <abstract>Research indicates that sources of work-related stress (WRS) impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Furthermore, specific features of the job can increase a pilot’s risk in relation to developing a mental health (MH) issue. It is impossible to remove all stress from the work life of pilots. A high stress situation may not necessarily be detrimental to the person, once they have learned to cope with it in a healthy manner. Nonetheless, risk pertaining to WRS need to be effectively managed by a pilot’s employer. Therefore, it is important to identify solutions at an airline and pilot self-management level. This paper reports on the findings of human factors research undertaken with commercial pilots pertaining to work-related stress (WRS) and its impact on wellbeing, performance, and safety. The findings of a series of co-design workshops and a follow-up anonymous survey were analysed to identify potential solutions at (1) an airline and (2) pilot self-management level. Potential solutions are framed in relation to six impact scenarios. Furthermore, they are located within the existing regulatory framework, including the latest implementation rules (IR), acceptable means of compliance (ACM), and guidance material (GM) as outlined by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA 2019). Proposed interventions should promote wellbeing and positive mental health while also addressing suffering and mental ill health. Airline interventions might focus on enhancing existing Safety Management System (SMS) approaches to better manage risks pertaining to WRS, advancing new tools to enable wellbeing briefing, risk assessment, and reporting, and training pilots in relation to MH awareness, risk identifying behaviour, and coping strategies. Furthermore, new role/functions might be introduced to support the implementation and management of WRS/wellbeing/MH safety/risk processes at an airline level. Requirements for new digital tools to support pilot awareness of WRS/wellbeing/MH, self-management of WRS/wellbeing/MH and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit are also proposed. Some of recommendations arising in this research require changes to the existing rule-making and/or modification to existing AMC and GM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>"

Specifically, this study makes a novel contribution as the first to quantitatively explore how internal marketing helps build happiness by changing flight attendants' work-family interface. Using a sample of 142 flight attendants working in airline companies based in Asian countries, our results indicate that communication, welfare systems, training, and management support are directly associated with happiness and indirectly associated with happiness via work-family facilitation. Communication, welfare systems, and management support can shape cabin crews' happiness via decreased work-family conflict. However, compensation is not found to influence flight attendants’ happiness. Practical implications and potential future research avenues also are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

The findings of the study reveal that female commercial airline pilots have been experiencing gender prejudice and discrimination in the workplace. These prejudices and discriminations place considerable psychological burden on them which can significantly affect their behaviour and performance. Considering the findings of the study, several recommendations are given to the airline companies and the society in supporting female pilots’ career advancement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

Many researchers have focused on aviation human factors and found that pilots’ fatigue status is the key factor. In this study, a hybrid multi-class Gaussian process model is proposed to identify the fatigue status of pilots by analyzing the surface electromyogram signals on the back of their neck and upper arm muscles. Instead of using the traditional conjugate gradient technique to determine the optimal parameters, a hybrid bacterial foraging and particle swarm method is proposed to optimize the unknown parameters to improve the classification accuracy of the multi-class Gaussian process. In the proposed method, the entropy-based features are extracted by wavelet translation from the collected signals to estimate the fatigue status of pilots. Experiments are performed through flight simulation in a full-flight simulator to provide three situations for the fatigue level of the subjects. Comparison of experimental results validates the feasibility of the proposed method to identify the fatigue status of pilots and the further enhancements by the proposed classification system in terms of classification accuracy. Results also show that the developed method helps prevent air crashes caused by pilots’ fatigue. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

No study to date has investigated the effects of conflict geometry on human factors variables of ATCOs through objective and physiological approaches. This study examines the effects of conflict geometries on ATCO situation awareness, stress level and brain activity during conflict resolution. Fifteen participants were instructed to resolve six different conflict geometries: crossing level, crossing non-level, converging level, converging non-level, overtaking level, and overtaking non-level. The results indicate that converging and crossing conflicts led to lower situation awareness (SA), higher stress level, and higher theta activation at the temporal and parietal lobes. Level conflict led to lower SA. The findings offer two implications, providing insights for the formal guidelines in ATC conflict resolution training and provision of inputs for the conflict resolution aid development. © The Royal Institute of Navigation 2019.</abstract>"
2020,China,The influence of mindfulness on mental state with regard to safety among civil pilots,"<title>The influence of mindfulness on mental state with regard to safety among civil pilots</title> <abstract>Civil pilots' mental state has an important impact on their safety operation behaviors. The goal of this paper is to explore the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety in Chinese airline pilots. 319 commercial civil pilots from China Southern Airlines Ltd. were investigated using three separate scales, which measured mindfulness, anxiety, and burnout. The results show that mindfulness has a negative effect on pilots' anxiety. Burnout partially mediates the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety. Thus, mindfulness primarily influences pilots’ anxiety indirectly, by affecting burnout. The findings with regard to mindfulness have important implications in terms of pilot selection and emotional intervention, which, if appropriately addressed, can contribute to improving aviation safety. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2020,Colombia - Spain,Psychophysiological response in night and instrument helicopter flights,"<title>Psychophysiological response in night and instrument helicopter flights</title> <abstract>Instrument and night flights are sources of mishaps: they produce stressful contexts to aircrews in which operability can be affected. This study aimed to analyse the effect of night and instrument flights in cortical arousal, autonomic modulation, muscle strength, and stress perception. 23 people were analysed (8 helicopter pilots, 4 helicopter mechanics–Spanish Air Forces–and 11 controls) before and after instrument and night flight exposition. Lactate and perceived exertion rose after flights. Anxiety was higher in instrument than in night flights. Pilots had a higher sense of anxiety before a flight compared to mechanics, although mechanics experienced a higher raise of heart rate during flight, with lower heart rate variability. Breath capacity was affected in pilots. Cortical arousal was more affected in unexperienced than in experienced aircrew during flights. These data suggest differences in their previous training. Practitioner summary: Night and instrument helicopter flights produced a different psychophysiological response of aircrew. These results could help to design specific training for aircrew that usually face instrument and night manoeuvres. Specific training based on high-intensity interval training integrated with reverse periodisation could improve their preparation.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed in 36 participants (39.06 ± 9.01 years) modifications in the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), subjective stress perception (SSP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (BOS), cortical arousal (critical flicker fusion threshold, CFFT), heart rate variability (HRV), spirometry, isometric hand strength (IHS), and short-term memory (ST-M) before and after an underwater evacuation training. Results: The maneuver produced a significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase in the SSP, RPE, Mean HR and maximum HR (Max HR), and a decrease in minimum HR (Min HR) and HRV. Conclusion: An underwater evacuation training produced an increase in the sympathetic nervous system modulation, elevating the psychophysiological stress response of the air crews, not negatively affecting their cortical arousal. © 2020 by the authors.

2020,Colombia - France - Netherlands - Sweden - United States,From top gun to the daily grind: contextualizing psychological contract breach for military pilots,"<title>From top gun to the daily grind: contextualizing psychological contract breach for military pilots</title> <abstract>This study expands our understanding of employee reactions to psychological contract (PC) breach by contextualizing the relationship between PC breach and feelings of violation in a European military setting through the study of strong commitment to specific career goals, high managerial turnover, lack of clarity about the perceived responsibility and controllability of PC breach, as well as aviation restrictions. Based on interviews with 41 pilots, we found that two factors–passion for job and professional commitment–which have not been a strong focus in extant research, play critical roles in the processes involved in employee PC breach reactions. We further contribute to the literature by demonstrating when, why, and where perceptions of PC breach influence exit, loyalty, voice, and neglect reactions in a military setting (e.g., we found that certain reactions, such as neglect, are restricted due to the potential safety consequences of said reactions). This research charts new directions for psychological contract research in which more attention is placed on the context within which psychological contract processes develop and change. We provide insights to practitioners and discuss implications, limitations, and future research directions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2020,United States,Psychiatry and fitness to fly after Germanwings,"<title>Psychiatry and fitness to fly after Germanwings</title> <abstract>In March 2015, a co-pilot flying Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately pointed his airplane into a descent, killing himself, five other crew members, and 144 passengers. Subsequent investigation and review teams examined the incident and considered potential lessons to maximize air safety. In this article, aviation industry clinical leaders, including the U.S. Federal Air Surgeon and Chief Psychiatrist from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), along with a professional pilot and collaborating forensic psychiatrists, discuss suicide-by-plane, evolving themes related to public safety responsibilities for psychiatrists treating pilots, and forensic trends in pilot evaluation for medical certification from an aerospace psychiatric perspective. We explore how psychiatric aspects of pilot fitness and aviation safety are examined across perspectives, including unsafe acts, preconditions, organizational factors, and unsafe supervision. We explore practices for civilian pilots and offer information related to military pilot fitness. Lessons from Germanwings are presented, as is the need for increased support for pilots who might be concerned about revealing mental health challenges for fear of loss of medical certification and pilot employment. The Air Line Pilots Association Pilot Assistance Network is highlighted as one example of pilots supporting pilots to increase airway safety. © 2020, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.

In Study 1, a 2-wave survey study of 468 manufacturing technicians, we found that belongingness need satisfaction mediated the negative relationship between abusive supervision and safety behavior. In Study 2, a multiwave survey study of 589 airline pilots, we found that safety behavior mediated the adverse relationship between abusive supervision and downstream objective safety performance. Higher trait social standing uncertainty was associated with a stronger adverse relationship between abusive supervision and safety. Indirect relationships of abusive supervision with safety behavior (Study 1) and safety performance (Study 2) were stronger among individuals with higher social standing uncertainty. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for managing abusive supervision and safety at work. © 2019 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2020,Australia,Detecting fatigue in car drivers and aircraft pilots by using non-invasive measures: The value of differentiation of sleepiness and mental fatigue,"<title>Detecting fatigue in car drivers and aircraft pilots by using non-invasive measures: The value of differentiation of sleepiness and mental fatigue</title> <abstract>Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most crucial factors that contribute to a decrease of the operating performance of aircraft pilots and car drivers and, as such, plays a dangerous role in transport safety. To reduce fatigue-related tragedies and to increase the quality of a healthy life, many studies have focused on exploring effective methods and psychophysiological indicators for detecting and monitoring fatigue. However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and field studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, fitness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufficient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters. © 2020 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2020,Netherlands - United Kingdom,Three patients with probable aerotoxic syndrome,"<title>Three patients with probable aerotoxic syndrome</title> <abstract>Introduction: “Aerotoxic syndrome” is a debated entity. Regulatory authorities consider long-term health effects to be an unlikely consequence of exposure to contaminated air because several air quality monitoring studies report low concentrations of toxic chemicals in cabin air. We describe two pilots and one flight attendant, who developed ill health during their flying career which improved after cessation of flying. Case details: The most frequently reported symptoms were headache, balance problems, fatigue, gastro-intestinal complaints and cognitive impairment. One of these patients had reduced levels of butyrylcholinesterase after a flight suggesting exposure to organophosphate compounds had occurred. All three were found to have elevated neuronal and glial auto-antibodies, biomarkers of central nervous system injury, and all three had genetic polymorphisms of paraoxonase (PON-1) and two of cytochrome P450, leading to a reduced ability to metabolize organophosphate compound (OPs). Discussion: A similar constellation of symptoms has been described in other studies of aircrew, although objective evidence of exposure is lacking in most of these studies. Reduced levels of butyrylcholinesterases in one of our cases is suggestive of causation and elevated neuronal and glial autoantibodies provide objective evidence of damage to the central nervous system. We consider further research is warranted. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2020,Norway,Organizational Learning Through Debriefing: The Process of Sharing and Hiding Knowledge,"<title>Organizational Learning Through Debriefing: The Process of Sharing and Hiding Knowledge</title> <abstract>Our objective with this article is to reach a better understanding of debriefing as a learning tool by exploring the process of sharing and hiding knowledge and mistakes, respectively. There is disparity between the ideal of sharing every mistake truthfully on the one hand, thus allowing mutual learning, and the human tendency to hide knowledge on the other hand, thus preventing mutual learning. We have identified the following research question: How do pilots experience the process of sharing and hiding mistakes during debriefing? The context is debriefing as it unfolded during regular training in a fighter squadron in the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Nine military pilots were interviewed, and the data were analyzed through coding and categorization. From the data analysis, four categories with subsequent narratives were revealed: (1) Mastery Culture – Embracing to Share Mistakes, (2) Safety Culture – Embarrassing to Hide Mistakes, (3) Performance Culture – Embarrassing to Share Mistakes, and (4) Cloaking Culture – Negotiating Whether to Share or Hide Mistakes. We discuss our findings in the light of the classic prisoner’s dilemma, delve deeper into the organizational, relational, and personal elements of this process and ask whether the military can learn from other professions. Our research deepens the knowledge of the disparity between the ideal of sharing mistakes and the human tendency to hide knowledge. Our research has practical implications for other military units and operative units, such as the police, fire fight-ers, and medical personnel as well as for organizational learning in general. © 2020 The Author(s).</abstract>"

PCB refers to organization’s inability in fulfilling obligations contained within the psychological contract, while CWB is defined as conducts that are harmful to organization. With 410 respondents, using Structural Equation Model (SEM), the results had shown that CWB increases as the PCB is heightened. This study adds value to the literature in three ways: PCB being tested among flight attendants; CWB being conceptualized using Hirschman’s Model of EVLN with an extension of acquiescent silence; and the application of Affective Events Theory (AET) in supporting the linkage between PCB and CWB in airline context. © 2020 Journal of Applied Structural Equation Modeling.</abstract>"

Methods: 98 flight attendants from Xiamen Airlines in China were recruited and randomly assigned to the LKM training group (n = 49) or the waiting control group (n = 49). The LKM training group underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention, and the control group did not undergo intervention. The three main variables (SWB, mindfulness, and spirituality) were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. Results: In the experimental group, SWB and spirituality increased significantly. In the control group, no significant differences were observed for the three variables between the pre-test and post-test. Conclusions: Our results indicated that LKM may help to improve SWB and spirituality. However, the mechanisms which underlie the effects of the LKM on mindfulness, spirituality, SWB, and other psychological constructs require further elucidation. © 2020 by the authors.

The mediating roles of evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect.</title> <abstract>The present study examined the daily relationship between job performance, relaxation, positive affect, and emotional labor. Drawing on the effort–recovery model and broaden-and-build theory, we proposed that job performance on a particular day fosters evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect and that this leads to increased deep acting and decreased surface acting the next day. To test our propositions, we conducted 2 diary studies using the experienced sampling method. In Study 1, 93 flight attendants participated in morning and end-of-workday surveys for 5 workdays. In Study 2, 98 hotel employees responded to morning, end-of-workday, and evening surveys for 5 workdays. In both studies, we found positive relationships between daily job performance, evening relaxation, next-morning positive affect, and next-day deep acting. We further found support for the indirect effect of daily job performance on next-day deep acting through evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect. Although next-morning positive affect had a marginally negative relationship with next-day surface acting in Study 1, this relationship became nonsignificant when next-morning negative affect was included in the model (Study 2). The robustness of these findings was validated in supplementary analyses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) © 2020 American Psychological Association</abstract>"

2020,Thailand - United States,The effect of cultural intelligence on burnout of Thai cabin crew in non-national airlines moderated by job tenure,"<title>The effect of cultural intelligence on burnout of Thai cabin crew in non-national airlines moderated by job tenure</title> <abstract>The job of cabin crew is considered to be a highly stressful job. In particular, cabin crew members who must deal with foreign passengers and a team of foreign coworkers are more prone to develop job burnout from their cross-cultural encounters. Therefore, having cross-cultural competence, which can help them to deal effectively with such situations, is crucial to preventing the problem of burnout. Cultural intelligence (CQ) was proposed in this research as a cross-cultural competence, essential for cabin crew members. The objective of the research was to examine the relationship between the CQ of the cabin crew members and the level of job burnout which they experience. Survey data were collected from a sample of 320 Thai cabin crew members, from seven non-Thai national airlines. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results supported the negative relationship between the CQ of cabin crew members and their job burnout. The moderating effect analysis also showed that the negative effect of CQ on burnout was particularly strong for cabin crew members with greater job tenure than those with lower job tenure. The results not only provide additional insight regarding the contribution of CQ to employee wellbeing in the airline industry, but also suggest some moderating conditions that could make CQ particularly essential for cabin crew members. Lastly, this research also provides recommendations for airline companies regarding interventions to prevent the psychological stress of their cabin crew. © 2020.</abstract>"
2020,New Zealand,Fatigue risk management for cabin crew: The importance of company support and sufficien rest for work-life balance—a qualitative study,"<title>Fatigue risk management for cabin crew: The importance of company support and sufficien rest for work-life balance—a qualitative study</title> <abstract>Knowledge about cabin crew fatigue associated with ultra-long range (ULR) flights is still limited. Current ULR scheduling for cabin crew is therefore predominantly based on flight crew data. Cabin crews’ views on fatigue, and their strategies for mitigating it, have seldom been sought. To better understand the causes and consequences of cabin crew fatigue, semi-structured focus group discussions were held. Thematic analysis was undertaken with data from 25 cabin crew. Participants indicated that the consequences of fatigue are twofold, affecting 1) cabin crew health and wellbeing and 2) safety (cabin, passenger and personal) and cabin service. While the primary causes of fatigue were sleep loss and circadian disruption, participants also identified other key factors including: insufficient rest, high workload, the work environment, a lack of company support, and insufficient fatigue management training. They highlighted the importance of sufficient rest, not only for obtaining adequate recovery sleep but also for achieving a work-life balance. They also highlighted the need for company support, effective communication, and management’s engagement with cabin crew in general. We recommend that priority is given to fatigue management training for cabin crew, which may also enhance perceived company support and assist with achieving a better work-life balance. © 2020 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.</abstract>"
2020,United Kingdom,Modelling and supporting flight crew decision-making during aircraft engine malfunctions: developing design recommendations from cognitive work analysis,"<title>Modelling and supporting flight crew decision-making during aircraft engine malfunctions: developing design recommendations from cognitive work analysis</title> <abstract>In this article, we analyse flight crew response to an in-flight powerplant system malfunction (PSM) using control task analysis. We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2020,China,The effect of psychological risk elements on pilot flight operational performance,"<title>The effect of psychological risk elements on pilot flight operational performance</title> <abstract>This study aims to examine the relationship between psychological risk elements and flight operation performance for airline pilots. First, the concept of “risky pilots” is discussed, and the existence of “risky pilots” is verified using a percentage analysis of flight exceedance events. Second, three psychological risk elements for pilots are investigated using an implementation of psychological scales, and the exceedance behaviors of risky pilots are analyzed based on real flight data. Finally, correlation and cluster analyses are used to study the influence of psychological risk elements on the exceedance behaviors of airline transport pilots and their operational performance. The results indicate that approximately one-third of pilots are more prone to exceedance events than other pilots. A moderate positive linear correlation (R [44] = 0.400; p <.05) existed between hazardous attitudes and severe exceedance rates. For pilots with a high level of risk psychology, 86% of their flights were considered “poor” operational performance level. Finally, it is concluded that hazardous attitude is a psychological risk element that has significant negative effects on severe exceedance behaviors of pilots. In addition, the flight operation performance levels of pilots were also affected by the psychological risk level. Furthermore, it is suggested that special training to improve risky hazardous attitudes of pilots should be conducted for the purpose of reducing exceedance behaviors and improving flight performance. These findings are expected to provide support for airlines to identify and manage flight crew risks. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc</abstract>"

A rehabilitation program consisting of a system of person-centered rational psychotherapy supported by a course of holotropic breathwork (breathing and ideomotor exercises) proved to be effective in abating preneurotic disorders. Altered states of consciousness achieved by holotropic breathwork have helped to correct rigid dominant mental conditions that distort the sense of professional motivation and deform behavioral typology. Therefore, holotropic breathwork recovers adaptability of pilot’s personality as a whole. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.</abstract>"
2019,United Kingdom,Cognitive function in simulated paragliding flight,"<title>Cognitive function in simulated paragliding flight</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Paragliding is an emerging discipline of aviation, with recreational pilots flying distances over 100 km. It remains risky. Accidents typically relate to pilot error rather than equipment failure. We measured cognition and physiological responses during simulated flight, to investigate whether errors might be due to pilot impairment, rather than misjudgment. METHODS: There were 10 male paraglider pilots (aged 19-58 yr) who undertook a simulated flight in an environmental chamber from sea level (0.209 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>) to 1524 m (0.174 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), 2438 m (0.156 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), and 3658 m (0.133 F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), over approximately 2 h. They experienced normobaric hypoxia, environmental cooling and headwind, completing logical reasoning, mannikin, mathematical processing, Stroop Color-Word and Tower Puzzle tasks; as well as measures of risk-taking (BART), mood (POMS), and subjective experience. RESULTS: Results were compared to ten controls, matched by age, sex, and flying experience. Physiological measures were oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, ventilation, heart rate, oxygen saturation, rectal and skin temperatures, blood glucose, blood lactate, and urine production. There were no significant differences between pilots and controls at any altitude. Results were heterogenous within and between individuals. As altitude increased, oxygen consumption and minute volume increased significantly, while oxygen saturations fell (98.3% [baseline] to 88.5% [peak]). Rectal temperatures fell by a statistically (but not clinically) significant amount (37.6°C to 37.3°C), while finger skin temperatures dropped steeply (32.2°C to 13.9°C). DISCUSSION: Results suggest cognitive impairment is unlikely to be a primary cause of pilot error during paragliding flights (of less than 2 h, below 3658 m), though hand protection requires improvement. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

An experimental design was used to evaluate the efficacy of AAI at reducing stress in AE military patients (N = 120). Patients participated in a 20-min AAI (n = 60) or 20-min informational session about assistance dogs as an attention-control group (n = 60). Demographics, post-traumatic stress symptom severity (PTSSS), and stress biomarkers (cortisol, alpha-amylase, and immunoglobulin A) were collected regular intervals. AAI was found feasible and efficacious at reducing stress. Cortisol decreased significantly (p <.05) in the AAI group compared with the attention-control group. PTSSS moderated the immunoglobulin A responses to AAI as demonstrated by the interaction of PTSD Checklist–Military Version score, group, and time, F(1, 111.23) = 4.15 p =.044; effect size: d = 0.31. This research supports AAI as a stress-reducing modality in AE patients, particularly those who report higher PTSSS.

2019,United Kingdom,"Extended suicide, or homicide followed by suicide","<title>Extended suicide, or homicide followed by suicide</title> <abstract>Background: Suicide with accompanying homicide is frightening and ill understood. Aims: To raise professional awareness of its complexities and difficulties and identify areas for developing research. Method: A Crime in Mind seminar was held in London in December 2018, with four expert presentations and discussion. This paper draws on that seminar and supplementary literature. Findings: Homicide/suicide is very difficult to predict and thus prevent. Victims and perpetrators may have a dependency relationship. Better training, especially of general practitioners, may increase the likelihood of detecting signs of despair and delusional ideas. Psychiatrists should be more alert to fixed delusions and homicidal thoughts. Individual assessment and management alone is unlikely to be sufficient. Public health strategies are likely to be important too. Weapons control is vital. Employers of people with great personal responsibility and special access to potentially lethal tools, such as airline pilots, and perhaps clinicians, should have regular, compulsory, mental health checks. Conclusions: Six points of clinical importance emerged, including lowering the threshold for diagnosing delusional disorder and the establishment of anti-violence clinics. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</abstract>"
2019,China,Predicting workload experienced in a flight test by measuring workload in a flight simulator,"<title>Predicting workload experienced in a flight test by measuring workload in a flight simulator</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: In order to determine the minimum flight crew number and show compliance with airworthiness regulations, the workload of flight crew should be measured in various flight scenarios both in a simulator and in flight tests demonstrating compliance. However, the complexity, environment, and safety considerations of flight tests require pilots to take more responsibility and be more careful with decisions and actions with higher stress, and it might be inappropriate to carry out flight tests in a high-risk abnormal situation. Therefore, it is necessary to assess workload measures in a simulator to predict workload experienced during a flight test. METHODS: Two subjective workload measurements and three psychophysiological measurements were compared both in a simulator and in a flight test among three flight scenarios. The scenarios were carried out in an ARJ21-700 full-flight simulator and a corresponding aircraft, and a total of 17 pilots participated. RESULTS: Both flight scenarios and flight environment had a significant influence on NASA-TLX, eye blink rate, and heart rate. Additionally, the NASA-TLX (R 5 0.864) and heart rate differences (R 5 0.840) presented strong correlations between the simulator and flight test. DISCUSSION: NASA-TLX and heart rate could be used in simulators and flight tests as consistent measures of workload. Furthermore, in order to reduce the quantity and risk of compliance during a flight test, the best strategy is to combine the results of the NASA-TLX scales and HR-D together in a flight simulator to predict workload experienced in a flight test. © Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"

However, little is known about factors relating to the work ability status of flight attendants. The aim of this study was to investigate the physical, mental, and work-related factors that affect flight attendants' work ability. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study and simple random sampling was conducted with participants employed at a Taiwan-based airline for longer than 1 yr. Analysis of variance and Pearson correlation tests were carried out to analyze work ability according to the flight attendants' social demographics, physical and mental health, and workrelated factors. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict the flight attendants' work abilities. RESULTS: A total of 472 flight attendants were recruited and the response rate was 78.67%. The work ability of the flight attendants ranged from 'moderate' to 'excellent' (WAI score, 34.1 6 1.8 to 45.1 6 1.5). In a regression analysis, work ability was positively associated with gender, age, and good eating habits; in contrast, insomnia and work-related burnout were negatively associated with work ability (R2 5 32.4%). DISCUSSION: Insomnia, work-related burnout, and eating habits had a significant impact on flight attendants' work abilities. Hence, it is important to address insomnia and high workloads and maintain a healthy lifestyle in the workplace. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"

The success or failure of high-G training could be multifactorial, but most previous studies have only focused on the effect of pilots' physical condition. METHODS: A total of 138 male trainee pilots participated in this study. All trainee pilots had received AGSM training from experienced instructors and then underwent centrifuge high-G training. Participants completed questionnaire surveys about body size, lifestyle, self-reported AGSM proficiency, resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC), and depression level (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). RESULTS: Of the 138 subjects, 100 (72.5%) successfully completed high-G training without experiencing G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) within two trials; these were allocated to the success group. The remaining 38 (27.5%) subjects who completed the training after three or more attempts, or who failed to complete the training at all, were allocated to the failure group. Multivariate analyses revealed that the success of centrifuge training was positively associated with age and self-reported AGSM proficiency, and negatively associated with depression level. DISCUSSION: The success of high-G training was significantly associated with self-reported AGSM proficiency and depression level. Instructors should emphasize the importance of AGSM proficiency and offer practice-based learning to trainee pilots. In addition, they should pay attention to not only trainee pilots' physical condition, but also their psychological status. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2019,Peru,Level of work stress and factors associated with bruxism in the military crew of the Peruvian Air Force,"<title>Level of work stress and factors associated with bruxism in the military crew of the Peruvian Air Force</title> <abstract>Background: Military life leads to a great personal sacrifice and labor in the aircrew because they are constantly subjected to innumerable activities which have a great work pressure; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of work stress associated with bruxism in the aircrew of the Peruvian Air Force. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 204 crew members of the Peruvian Air Force from the Air Group were surveyed, and the stomatological clinical inspection was carried out. Each crew member was evaluated using the validated International Labor Organization-World Health Organization (ILO-WHO) Work Stress Scale, and clinical records were used to diagnose bruxism using the Smith and Knight wear index. Results: It was found that 93.7% (n = 191) of the crew members were men and 6.3% (n = 13) were women; and the percentage of intermediate-level stress was found to be high in the grade of non-commissioned officers, whereas in the officer grade, the level of stress was low. There was also a statistically significant association between the variables military grade, sex, and age group. The sub-officers presented a higher percentage in the category ""with bruxism"", while in the rank of officers the category of “non-bruxism” was the most prevalent. Conclusions: This study showed a statistically significant association between the variable bruxism and the level of work stress between the military aviators of the Peruvian Air Force (p<0.001). © 2019</abstract>"
2019,United Kingdom,Occupational stress in Remotely Piloted Aircraft System operators,"<title>Occupational stress in Remotely Piloted Aircraft System operators</title> <abstract>Background: Although there is currently little research data to support the contention, concerns have been raised about possible traumatic stressors inherent to Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) operator roles. Factors such as exposure to visually traumatic events compounded by long working hours and blurred boundaries between military and civilian life have been cited as potential stressors. Robust research into the well-being of RPAS operators is scarce and mostly samples US personnel. Aims: To provide mental health and well-being data relating to UK RPAS operators. Methods: UK RPAS operators completed mental health questionnaires to assess levels of post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms, alcohol use and occupational functioning. Respondents were also asked about work patterns. Results: Forty-one per cent of the sample reported potentially hazardous alcohol use. Ten per cent met psychiatric symptom criteria for moderate or severe anxiety, and 20% for moderate depressive symptoms. While there were no cases of probable PTSD, 30% of the sample reported sub-clinical PTSD symptoms likely to impair occupational functioning. Overall, 70% of the sample reported that psychological symptoms significantly impaired their functioning. Conclusions: Compared to UK military sub-groups, RPAS operators were not at increased risk of mental health problems. However, a high proportion of the sample reported significant functional impairment, which has not been explored in other comparable studies. The most frequently highlighted work-related stressors were timing of RPAS work and operator shift patterns. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

2019,Turkey,Strategic approach to managing human factors risk in aircraft maintenance organization: risk mapping,"<title>Strategic approach to managing human factors risk in aircraft maintenance organization: risk mapping</title> <abstract>Purpose: Aviation has multi-cultural business environment in all aspects as operational and management. Managing aviation requires high awareness on human factor risk which includes organizational behavior-related topics. The greatest risk to an enterprise’s ability to achieve its strategic goals and objectives is the human factor. Both organizational behavior and corporate culture behavior with social psychology are the most vital aspects of management and strategy in terms of human resources. Related risks, including organizational behavior and culture, have the potential to directly impact on both business performance and corporate sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, the most prominent risks were determined in accordance with social psychology, and after identification of human factor-based risks, these have prioritized and prepared risk mapping with fresh approach. For this reason, this study aims to develop risk mapping model for human factors that takes into account interrelations among risk factors three dimensional based new approach. This approach includes both identification of human factor based risks, prioritization them and setting risk mapping according to corporate based qualifications via tailoring risk list. Developed risk map in this paper will help to manage corporate risks to achieve improved performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This new organizational behavior- and culture-focused risk mapping model developed in this study has the potential to make significant contribution to the management of the human factor for modern management and strategy. In enterprise risk management system, risk mapping is both strong and effective strategic methodology to manage ergonomics issue with strategic approach. Human factor is both determinative and also strategic element to both continuity and performance of business operations with safely and sound. In view of management and strategy, vitally, the human factor determines the outcome in both every business and every decision-making. Findings: It is assumed that, if managers manage human risk you may get advantages to achieving corporate strategies in timely manner. Aviation is sensitive sector for its ingredients: airports, airlines, air traffic management, aircraft maintenance, pilotage and ground handling. Aim of this paper is to present risk management approach to optimize human performance while minimizing both failures and errors by aircraft maintenance technician (AMT). This model may apply all human factors in other departments of aviation such as pilots and traffic controllers. AMT is key component of aircraft maintenance. Thus, errors made by AMTs will cause aircraft accidents or incidents or near miss incidents. In this study, new taxonomy model for human risk factors in aircraft maintenance organizations has been designed, and also new qualitative risk assessment as three dimensions is carried out by considering the factors affecting the AMT’s error obtained from extensive literature review and expert opinions in the field of aviation. Human error risks are first categorized into two main groups and sub three groups and then prioritized using the risk matrix via triple dimension as probability, severity and interrelations ratio between risks. Practical implications: Risk mapping is established to decide which risk management option they will apply for managers when they will look at this map. Managers may use risk map to both identify their managerial priorities and share sources to managing risks, and make decisions on risk handling options. This new model may be a useful new tool to manage ergonomic human factor-based risks in developing strategy in aviation business management. In addition, this paper will contribute to department of management and strategy and related literature. Originality/value: This study has originality via new modeling of risk matrix. In this study, dimension of risk analysis has been improved as three dimensions. This study has new approach and new assessment of risk with likelihood (probability), impact (severity) and interrelations ratio. This new model may be a useful new tool to both assess and prioritize mapping of ergonomic-based risks in business management. In addition, this research will contribute to aviation management and strategy literature and also enterprise risk management literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2019,Greece - India,Current trends and future perspectives of space neuroscience towards preparation for interplanetary missions,"<title>Current trends and future perspectives of space neuroscience towards preparation for interplanetary missions</title> <abstract>This review addresses central nervous system (CNS) physiological changes during inter-planetary missions, specifically sensorimotor processing and sleep disorders. Isolation, confinement and induced stress factors also have a detrimental effect on cognitive and mental well-being, which could jeopardize mission accomplishment. Although countermeasures have been proposed, they mostly focus on cardiovascular and/or musculoskeletal systems. Long-term space flights require optimal cognitive performance of crew members during weightlessness for longer time periods independent of ground support. The present study describes various countermeasures trends in neuroscientific data acquisition and future perspectives of advanced analysis through functional connectivity and graph theory. These could be used to identify early deterioration patterns and evaluate the robustness of countermeasures employed. © 2019 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India.</abstract>"
2019,Norway,Risk of fatigue among airline crew during 4 consecutive days of flight duty,"<title>Risk of fatigue among airline crew during 4 consecutive days of flight duty</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Airline crew are being exposed to extended workdays and compressed work periods, with quick returns between duties, implying a heightened physiological and psychological strain that may lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue. The aim of the study was assessment of the effect of an extended day of flight duty and a compressed work week with regard to recovery, cumulative fatigue, and neurobehavioral performance. METHODS: We followed 18 pilots and 41 cabin crewmembers during four consecutive days of flight duty, comprising a total of ≥ 39 h, where the first day was ≥ 10 h. Information on demographics, work characteristics, health status, and physical activity was collected at baseline. Subjects completed logs for the first and fourth workday, including the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Checklist at three time points during these workdays. Two computer-based neurobehavioral tests were completed the evening prior to the first shift, and after the first and the fourth day of the work period. RESULTS: Number of flight sectors during the work period was 10-20. Self-reported fatigue levels increased during the workdays. Neurobehavioral test-scores did not deteriorate. The effects of each additional flight sector during the work period was elevated reaction times (RT) both among cabin crewmembers (B = 5.05 ms, 95% CI 0.6, 9.5) and pilots (B = 4.95 ms, 95% CI 0.4, 9.5). Precision was unaffected. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots and cabin crewmembers seem to obtain satisfactory sleep before and during the period of 4 consecutive days. The association between multiple flight sectors and increased fatigue supports previous findings. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2019,Spain - United States,The effects of flight complexity on gaze entropy: An experimental study with fighter pilots,"<title>The effects of flight complexity on gaze entropy: An experimental study with fighter pilots</title> <abstract>We studied the effects of task load variations as a function of flight complexity on combat pilots' gaze behavior (i.e., entropy) while solving in-flight emergencies. The second company of the Spanish Army Attack Helicopter Battalion (n = 15) performed three sets of standardized flight exercises with different levels of complexity (low [recognition flights], medium and high [emergency flights]). Throughout the flight exercises we recorded pilots' gaze entropy, as well as pilots' performance (assessed by an expert flight instructor) and subjective ratings of task load (assessed by the NASA-Task Load Index). Furthermore, we used pilots' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a reference physiological index for task load variations. We found that pilots’ gaze entropy decreased ∼2% (i.e., visual scanning became less erratic) while solving the emergency flight exercises, showing a significant decreasing trend with increasing complexity (p <.05). This is in consonance with the ∼12% increase in the frontal theta band of their EEG spectra during said exercises. Pilots' errors and subjective ratings of task load increased as flight complexity increased (p-values <.05). Gaze data suggest that pilots used nondeterministic visual patterns when the aircraft was in an error-free state (low complexity), and changed their scanning behavior, becoming more deterministic, once emergencies occurred (medium/high complexity). Overall, our findings indicate that gaze entropy can serve as a sensitive index of task load in aviation settings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

EEG and pupil diameter recordings were collected from 47 ATC students (27 more experienced and 20 less experienced) during a high-fidelity, variable workload approach-control scenario. Scenario workload was manipulated by increasing the number of aircraft released and the presence of a divided attention task. Results showed that scenario performance significantly degraded with increased aircraft and the presence of the divided attention task. No scenario performance differences were found between experience groups. The EEG engagement metric significantly differed between experience groups, with less experienced controllers exhibiting higher engagement than more experienced controllers. The EEG workload metric and pupil diameter were sensitive to workload manipulations but did not differentiate experience groups. Commercially available EEG cognitive state metrics may be a viable tool for enhancing ATC training. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2019,Netherlands,Flight performance aspects during military helicopter flights,"<title>Flight performance aspects during military helicopter flights</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: A flight is composed of many flight performance aspects. However, not all of these aspects are equally important for the success and safety of a flight. When investigating the influence of a stressor on flight performance, it is important to understand not only which flight performance aspects are important for the success and the safety of the flight, but also which of these aspects will most likely be affected by reduced alertness. METHOD: A total of 136 helicopter pilots of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) of all qualification levels were invited to participate in a three-round ranking Delphi study. RESULTS: A total of 41 (30%) helicopter pilots completed the first questionnaire round and 20 (77%) flight instructors completed the ranking round. The top ten skills elements comprised seven nontechnical skills (NTS), namely, awareness of the environment, decision making, workload management, stress management, planning and coordinating, general knowledge, and basic fitness; and three technical skills (TS), that is, advanced aircraft handling, flight maneuvers and procedures, and abnormal and emergency procedures. The top three ranked skill elements (awareness of environment, decision making, and workload management) were considered by the flight instructors to be highly influenced by reduced pilot alertness. CONCLUSION: NTS are considered more important and more affected by reduced pilot alertness during operational helicopter flight compared to TS. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2019,Norway,Flight anxiety reported from 1986 to 2015,"<title>Flight anxiety reported from 1986 to 2015</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Fear of flying is one of the most common phobias. It hinders people in performing their work and hampers family relations. Even though flight traffic has increased, there are new fears. Valid studies are needed to answer whether there have been changes in the prevalence of flight anxiety, are there sex differences in relation to fear of flying, use of alcohol, and tranquilizers, which situations cause the most flight anxiety, and whether the above factors have changed compared to a similar study from 1986. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to a representative random sample of the Norwegian population (N = 5500), where 36% answered. To assess flight anxiety across the time period, we used similar instruments to those we used in 1986. RESULTS: The prevalence of an assumed flight phobia decreased from 8% in 1986 to 3% in 2015. The percentage of those reported to never fly had decreased from 5% in 1986 to 0.5% in 2015. There were 11.0% who always used alcohol in 1986 and 7.5% in 2015 and 3% and 2%, respectively, always used tranquillizers. More women reported being afraid of both flying and other situations compared to men. Turbulence, unknown sounds, and fear of terror attacks caused the most anxiety. DISCUSSION: Flight anxiety still affects a considerable proportion of the Norwegian population and more women than men report that they are afraid of flying. However, in spite of methodology, people are significantly less afraid of flying than in 1986. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2019,France,"Inattentional deafness to auditory alarms: Inter-individual differences, electrophysiological signature and single trial classification","<title>Inattentional deafness to auditory alarms: Inter-individual differences, electrophysiological signature and single trial classification</title> <abstract>Inattentional deafness can have deleterious consequences in complex real-life situations (e.g. healthcare, aviation) leading to miss critical auditory signals. Such failure of auditory attention is thought to rely on top-down biasing mechanisms at the central executive level. A complementary approach to account for this phenomenon is to consider the existence of visual dominance over hearing that could be implemented via direct visual-to-auditory pathways. To investigate this phenomenon, thirteen aircraft pilots, equipped with a 32-channel EEG system, faced a low and high workload scenarii along with an auditory oddball task in a motion flight simulator. Prior to the flying task, the pilots were screened to assess their working memory span and visual dominance susceptibility. The behavioral results disclosed that the volunteers missed 57.7% of the auditory alarms in the difficult condition. Among all evaluated capabilities, only the visual dominance index was predictive of the miss rate in the difficult scenario. These findings provide behavioral evidences that other early cross-modal competitive process than top down modulation process could account for inattentional deafness. The electrophysiological analyses showed that the miss over the hit alarms led to a significant amplitude reduction of early perceptual (N100) and late attentional (P3a and P3b) event-related potentials components. Eventually, we implemented an EEG-based processing pipeline to perform single-trial classification of inattentional deafness. The results indicate that this processing chain could be used in an ecological setting as it led to 72.2% mean accuracy to discriminate missed from hit auditory alarms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"

The participants rated dimensions of job requirements (psychological demands, overcommitment, work-family interferences), job resources (control, professional, and personal social support), and health indicators. The results show that the ATCOs in the study perceived their job as an active and demanding job but not in the same stressful way as civil ATCOs do. Some job requirement dimensions were positively associated with a number of health indicators. Overall and on-shift job resources were partially correlated, unlike overall and on-shift job requirements.

2019,United States,Medical Suspension in Female Army Rotary-Wing Aviators,"<title>Medical Suspension in Female Army Rotary-Wing Aviators</title> <abstract>Introduction Female aviators with health conditions may face a variety of occupational impacts. Outcomes may include a waiver for continued flight or a permanent suspension, in which flight is no longer possible. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of medical diagnosis among female U.S. Army aviators over a ten year period and identify associations of clinical diagnoses leading to waiver or permanent suspension. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary data analysis; data were retrieved on 1,282 female, rated aviator patients from an Army Aviation epidemiological database. The archival dataset was composed of a total of 6,856 cases between June 2005 and June 2015. Age ranged from 19 to 58 years. The data were examined in terms of raw ICD-9 diagnostic codes, grouped system diagnoses (diagnosis categories), and occupational consequence. Spearman's rho correlations were used to determine associations between diagnosis, waiver and permanent suspension. Results The leading diagnoses were pregnancy, normal delivery, and allergic rhinitis. The systems approach yielded pregnancy, orthopedic disorders, and spinal disorders as the leading diagnosis categories. Leading waivered conditions included spinal, psychiatric, and neurological disorders. In terms of permanent suspension, the leading cause was depression, followed by migraine and post-traumatic stress disorders. In almost all diagnostic groupings, the Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between age and diagnosis were positively related. However, age was not associated with negative occupational outcome (permanent suspension), generally. Conclusions A variety of conditions negatively impact the health and occupational status of female aviators, with disparate occupational impacts. Prevalent conditions differed from those reported previously for all aviators in a predominantly male population. The absence of cardiovascular disease is a significant change from 20-30 years ago. Among all medical diagnoses, a minority are responsible for a greater occupational burden. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.</abstract>"

This research aimed to study the psychophysiological response of an air security force in a simulated air accident in a hostile area and its subsequent subterfuge to a safe area. We analyzed 13 soldiers (32.4 ± 8.0 years) from an air security force unit of the Spanish Air Force who were divided into three teams to conduct the manoeuvre. We analyzed before and after the manoeuvre psychological well-being scale, personal views survey, recovery-stress questionnaire (REST-52 Sport); heart rate variability, visual analogue scale, rated of perceived exertion, spirometry, hydration and hand strength were analyzed during the four days of the manoeuvre: This produced a significantly (p <.05) increase in sympathetic modulation, hand strength, dehydration status, general and specific stress from RESTQ-52. With this data we can conclude that an air accident manoeuvre of three nights and four days causes in the air mobile protection team a high sympathetic nervous system modulation, increases on muscle strength manifestations and stress and a dehydration status. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>"

The aim of this study was to study the effect of hypoxia training in cortical arousal, autonomic modulation, muscle strength and cognitive function. We analysed 23 male aircrew personnel of the Spanish Army and Air Force (10 Helicopter Pilots, 7 Transport Aircrew, 3 Transport Pilots and 3 F-18 Fighter Pilots) before, during and after a normobaric hypoxia exposition. Hypoxia produced an increase in perceived stress and effort, a higher Heart Rate and a decreased function of breath muscles. Working memory and pattern recognition were impaired after hypoxia exposition. Significant differences were found in cognitive tests performance among aircrew groups, suggesting differences on their previous training. These results can improve specific training for better preparation of pilots and aircrews for hypoxic threats. Practitioner summary: Distinct aircrew preparation produces a different hypoxia exposition effect on psychophysiological response and cognitive functions. Hypoxia produced an increase in Heart Rate, a decreased function of breath muscles, being more negatively affected in Transport Pilots. Cognition abilities were impaired after hypoxia exposition, independently of the aircrew group. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2019,"Ireland - Taiwan, Province of China - United Kingdom",The impact of alerting designs on air traffic controller’s eye movement patterns and situation awareness,"<title>The impact of alerting designs on air traffic controller’s eye movement patterns and situation awareness</title> <abstract>This research investigated controller’ situation awareness by comparing COOPANS’s acoustic alerts with newly designed semantic alerts. The results demonstrate that ATCOs’ visual scan patterns had significant differences between acoustic and semantic designs. ATCOs established different eye movement patterns on fixations number, fixation duration and saccade velocity. Effective decision support systems require human-centered design with effective stimuli to direct ATCO’s attention to critical events. It is necessary to provide ATCOs with specific alerting information to reflect the nature of the critical situation in order to minimise the side effects of startle and inattentional deafness. Consequently, the design of a semantic alert can significantly reduce ATCOs’ response time, therefore providing valuable extra time in a time-limited situation to formulate and execute resolution strategies in critical air safety events. The findings of this research indicate that the context-specified design of semantic alerts could improve ATCO’s situational awareness and significantly reduce response time in the event of Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activation which alerts to two aircraft having less than the required lateral or vertical separation. Practitioner Summary: Eye movements are closely linked with visual attention and can be analysed to explore shifting attention whilst performing monitoring tasks. This research has found that context-specific designed semantic alerts facilitated improved ATCO cognitive processing by integrating visual and auditory resources. Semantic designs have been demonstrated to be superior to acoustic design by directing the operator’s attention more quickly to critical situations.Abbreviations: APW: area proximity warning; ASRS: aviation safety reporting system; ATC: air traffic control; ATCO: air traffic controller; ATM: air traffic management; COOPANS: cooperation between air navigation service providers; HCI: human-computer interaction; IAA: irish aviation authority; MSAW: minimum safe altitude warning; MTCD: medium-term conflict detection; SA: situation awareness; STCA: short term conflict alert; TP: trajectory prediction. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"

Using a large sample of airline pilots, we showed that 40% of the participating pilots experience high burnout. In line with Job Demands-Resources theory, job demands were detrimental for simulator training performance because they made pilots more exhausted and less able to craft their job, whereas job resources had a favourable effect because they reduced feelings of disengagement and increased job crafting. Moreover, burnout was negatively related to pilots’ happiness with life. These findings highlight the importance of psychosocial factors and health for valuable outcomes for both pilots and airlines. Practitioner Summary: Using an online survey among the members of a European pilots’ professional association, we examined the relationship between psychosocial factors (work characteristics, burnout) and outcomes (simulator training performance, happiness). Forty per cent of the participating pilots experience high burnout. Job demands were detrimental, whereas job resources were favourable for simulator training performance/happiness.

Subjective ratings of pilot perception of controller responsibility for five key flight tasks were obtained from thirty helicopter pilots. Three types of airspace were investigated. Results indicate that there is variation in pilot understanding of controller responsibility compared to the formal regulations that define controller responsibility. Significant differences in the perception of controller responsibility were found for the task of aircraft separation in class D airspace and along helicopter routes. Analysis of the patterns of response suggests that task type rather than the airspace type may be the key factor. Results are framed using the concept of a shared mental model. This research demonstrates that pilots flying in complex London airspace have an expectation of controller responsibility for certain flight tasks, in certain airspace types that is not supported by aviation regulation. Practitioner Summary: The responsibility for tasks during flight varies according to the flight rules used and airspace type. Helicopter pilots may attribute responsibility to controllers for tasks when controllers have no responsibility as defined by regulation. This variation between pilot perceptions of controller responsibility could affect safety within the London control zone. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2019,United States,Heart rate variability and performance of commercial airline pilots during flight simulations,"<title>Heart rate variability and performance of commercial airline pilots during flight simulations</title> <abstract>Pilots undergo a variety of stressors that may affect their performance during all phases of flight. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been considered as a reliable indicator of the parasympathetic and sympathetic activities of human autonomic nervous system, which can be used to characterize the sympathetic stress response of pilots during flight. In this study, thirty active commercial airline pilots were recruited to fly three flight segments in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-certified A320 flight simulator with each segment at a different carbon dioxide (CO <inf>2</inf> ) concentration on the flight deck. The pilots performed a series of maneuvers of varying difficulty, and their performance was evaluated by FAA designated pilot examiners. The HRV metrics (SDNN, RMSSD and LF/HF ratio) of each pilot both before and during flight simulations were measured with a Movisens EcgMove3 sensor. The average SDNN, RMSSD and LF/HF ratio of the pilots during flight simulations were 34.1 ± 12.7 ms, 23.8 ± 10.2 ms and 5.7 ± 2.8 respectively. Decreased HRV was associated with aging, obesity and performing difficult maneuvers. Both CO <inf>2</inf> exposure and HRV had an independent effect on the pilot performance, while their interaction was not significant. The generalized additive mixed effect model results showed that a pilot performed better on a maneuver when his stress response was lower, as indicated by higher SDNN and RMSSD and lower LF/HF ratio. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in SDNN (21.97 ms) and RMSSD (16.00 ms) and an IQR decrease in LF/HF ratio (4.69) was associated with an increase in the odds of passing a maneuver by 37%, 22% and 20%, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

2019,Australia,Unearthing airspace: the historical phenomenology of aviation artefacts,"<title>Unearthing airspace: the historical phenomenology of aviation artefacts</title> <abstract>From wreck sites to former airfields, aviation archaeology has traditionally focused on the materiality of aircraft construction, modification and logistics. Rarely invoked, however, are the sensations of flight and the ways in which technology governs human interaction with the skies. In theorising an archaeology of airspace, this paper explores the remnants of two World War II aviation technologies. The first comprises the residues of wartime radar stations dotted along the Australian coastline. Sustained by generators and cabling, their electromagnetic beams projected a new domain of national sovereignty into the skies: airspace. The second case is the Cotton Aerodynamic Anti-G suit, a rubberised outfit designed to protect fighter pilots from ‘blackout’ during high-G manoeuvres. Analysing this assemblage prompts a phenomenological re-imagining of the physiology and psychology of airborne combat. Together, these artefacts illustrate how the material remains of aviation technologies can evoke both the experiential and electromagnetic realms of flight in the past. © 2019, Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology Incorporated.

2019,United Kingdom,Third-culture kid pilots and multi-cultural identity efects on pilots' attitudes,"<title>Third-culture kid pilots and multi-cultural identity efects on pilots' attitudes</title> <abstract>IP: 103.3.231.66 On: Thu, 09 Jan 2020 04:17:02 Copyright: Aerospace Medical Association BACKGROUND: Current attempts to culturally tailor human factors training in aviation segregates cultural identities based on geopoliti- cal, passport nationality, and is therefore poorly suited for (adult) 'Third Culture Kids' (TCKs) whose cross-cultural upbringing has led to the development of multicultural individual identities that do not relect their passport nationali- ties. In this study, respondents' self-categorization of personal cultural identity, as opposed to passport nationality, was used to determine whether there were cultural diferences in airline pilots' behaviors. METHOD: A survey with items imported from established scales was distributed to pilots of an international airline to measure pilots' work values, light management attitudes, and cultural dimensions, with respondents segregated into Western, TCK, or Asian cultural groups. RESULTS: TCKs shared similar work values with Westerners, were similarly individualistic, had comparable preference for shallow command gradients, were similarly pragmatic in self-evaluation of performance under stress, and both had lower dependency and preference for rules and procedures. TCKs scored in the middle between Westerners and Asians in automation preference attitudes, and on the cultural dimensions of power distance and uncertainty avoidance. TCKs did not share any similarities with Asians at all. DISCUSSION: The results show that TCKs were neither assimilated into a mainstream culture, nor culturally ""middle of the pack"" as may be expected from their ""East meets West"" backgrounds. Having identiied TCK pilots' unique values, attitudes, and dimensions, practical implications include changing training design to better suit TCKs' cultural characteristics and the adaptation of airline management to cater for TCKs' work values. © Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2019,Poland,The influence of sloping cloud in the visual field on the cognitive determinants of military pilots’ behavior,"<title>The influence of sloping cloud in the visual field on the cognitive determinants of military pilots’ behavior</title> <abstract>Objectives: The study analyzed the effectiveness of military pilots’ behavior under the influence of false horizon illusion – a false perception of the real horizon. It was assumed that visual illusion tends to cause spatial disorientation (SD). The question was asked which orientation of the sloping cloud (right/left) would have a bigger impact on SD. The effectiveness of the flight profile performance under the influence of visual illusion was analyzed in the context of the field dependence (FD), field independence (FI) or field intermediate dependence (FINT) of perception, the effectiveness of attention and operational memory. Material and Methods: The study covered 66 pilots. A flight simulator was used as a measure of effectiveness in performing the flight profile in spatial disorientation conditions. The effectiveness of attention and working memory was diagnosed using 4 computer tasks. Results: It was revealed that the right sloping cloud (compared to the left sloping cloud) had a greater impact on military pilots’ behavior. The cognitive style distinguishes the accuracy of the flight profile performance from the inclined cloud pointing to the right. The comparisons showed significant differences between the FI and FD pilot groups. All the pilots demonstrated the right-sided asymmetry of the flight rate. While performing tasks on the simulator, the FI pilots were characterized by a more stable rate than the FINT pilots. Conclusions: A general conclusion is that the “correct falling cloud” had a greater impact on pilots’ behavior. The presented results confirm the hypothesis that susceptibility to visual illusions is significantly increased in the pilots characterized by field dependence while the pilots with the FINT style of perception are characterized by a greater variability of the flight rate. © 2019 Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

2019,Croatia,Subjective air traffic complexity estimation using artificial neural networks,"<title>Subjective air traffic complexity estimation using artificial neural networks</title> <abstract>Air traffic complexity is usually defined as difficulty of monitoring and managing a specific air traffic situation. Since it is a psychological construct, best measure of complexity is that given by air traffic controllers. However, there is a need to make a method for complexity estimation which can be used without constant controller input. So far, mostly linear models were used. Here, the possibility of using artificial neural networks for complexity estimation is explored. Genetic algorithm has been used to search for the best artificial neural network configuration. The conclusion is that the artificial neural networks perform as well as linear models and that the remaining error in complexity estimation can only be explained as inter-rater or intra-rater unreliability. One advantage of artificial neural networks in comparison to linear models is that the data do not have to be filtered based on the concept of operations (conventional vs. trajec-tory-based). © 2019, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

2019,Australia,Preflight risk assessment for improved safety in Helicopter Emergency Medical Service operations,"<title>Preflight risk assessment for improved safety in Helicopter Emergency Medical Service operations</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Adverse weather and poor visual cues are common elements in night-time Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) operations contributing to spatial disorientation and fatal accidents. Pilots are required to make weather-related preflight risk assessments to accept or reject a flight. This study's aim was to develop predictive risk assessment tools based on historical accident data to assist the decision-making process. METHODS: We analyzed 32 single-pilot HEMS night-time visual flight rules fatal accidents to identify contributory risk factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop prediction nomograms for nonvisual meteorological conditions (non-VMC), cause and nonsurvivable accidents as dependent variables. Risk factors such as temperature dew point spread, elevation difference, and years of HEMS pilot experience, were entered as continuous variables. Flight crew composition, pilot DTE (domain task experience) and flight rule capability, primary missions, and temperature dew point spread were entered as categorical variables. A point scoring matrix transposed model probability to likelihood and consequence severity. RESULTS: The nomograms correctly predicted the likelihood of entering non-VMC, accident cause, and sustaining a nonsurvivable accident in 75%, 55%, and 94% of cases, respectively. Using data from a recent nonsurvivable HEMS accident, the nomogram estimated a 92% probability (Very Likely) of nonsurvivable accident if visual cues were lost. CONCLUSION: These nomograms can provide preflight information to predict the likelihood of adverse safety outcomes occurring during a planned HEMS mission. While further development work is needed, this approach has the potential to improve HEMS operational safety. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2019,United States,The impact of workplace harassment on health in a working cohort,"<title>The impact of workplace harassment on health in a working cohort</title> <abstract>Background: Workplace abuse, including sexual harassment, is frequently experienced worldwide and is related to adverse mental health outcomes, and injuries. Flight attendants are an understudied occupational group and are susceptible to harassment due to working in a feminized, client-facing occupation with few protections or sanctioned responses against aggressive behaviors. Objective: We investigated the relationship between workplace abuse and health in a cohort of cabin crew. We also aimed to characterize perpetrator profiles. Methods: We conducted our study among 4,459U.S. and Canada-based participants from the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study using multivariate logistic regression. Our exposures of interest were episodes of workplace abuse in the past year. We evaluated several mental and physical health outcomes, including depression, fatigue, musculoskeletal injuries, and general workplace injuries. Results: We report that exposures to verbal abuse, sexual harassment, and sexual assault are common among cabin crew, with 63, 26, and 2% of respondents, respectively, reporting harassment in the past year alone. Workplace abuse was associated with depression, sleep disturbances, and musculoskeletal injuries among male and female crew, with a trend toward increasing odds ratios (ORs) given a higher frequency of events. For example, sexual harassment was related to an increased odds for depression (OR = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-2.30), which increased in a dose response-like manner among women reporting harassment once (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.93-1.95), 2-3 times (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.29-2.38), and 4 or more times (OR = 4.12, 95% CI: 3.18-5.06). We found that passengers were the primary perpetrators of abuse. Conclusions: Our study is the first to comprehensively characterize workplace abuse and harassment and its relation to health in a largely female customer-facing workforce. The strong associations with health outcomes observed in our study highlights the question of how workplace policies can be altered to mitigate prevalent abuses. Clinicians could also consider how jobs with high emotional labor demands may predispose people to adverse health outcomes, educate patients regarding their psychological/physical responses and coping strategies, and be aware of signs of distress in patients working in such occupations in order to direct them to the appropriate treatments and therapies. © 2019 Gale, Mordukhovich, Newlan and McNeely.</abstract>"

2019,China,Emotional intelligence and emotional state effects on simulated flight performance,"<title>Emotional intelligence and emotional state effects on simulated flight performance</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Flight cadets' emotion is a factor of great importance to flight training. So it is of profound significance to address how emotional factors affect flight training performance. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and simulated flight performance (SFP), and explore the mechanism of emotional state as a mediator in the effect of EI on SFP. METHODS: Ninety undergraduates took part in the study. EI (Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale), neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised), anxiety (State Anxiety Inventory), and tension (Profile of Mood States) were collected. Conducted were 9 h of simulated flight training in a simulator of the Type 6 Primary Trainer. The Delphi Experts Grading Method was used to assess students' SFP. Mediation effect of emotional state was explored using regression analysis. RESULTS: EI was significantly correlated with neuroticism (r = 20.31), tension (r = -0.31), and anxiety (r = -0.31), respectively. Multiple mediation effects showed that emotional state mediated the association between EI and SFP. Tension especially mediated the associations between the Self Emotion Appraisals and Regulation of Emotion dimensions of EI and SFP. However, the Use of Emotion dimension of EI had a direct negative effect on SFP without the mediating role of emotional state. DISCUSSION: The findings indicated that EI was significantly correlated with emotional state (neuroticism, tension, and anxiety). EI may directly or indirectly affect SFP and tension played an important mediating role. Implications for the promotion of EI and emotional state to enhance performance in real flight training are discussed. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2019,United States,A Year on the International Space Station: Implementing a long-duration biomedical research mission,"<title>A Year on the International Space Station: Implementing a long-duration biomedical research mission</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The year-long mission of American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko included the most complex biomedical experiments ever conducted on the International Space Station-and arguably in human spaceflight-to establish insight into human health risks of interplanetary exploration. Focusing on risk mitigation, NASA conducted investigations that addressed spaceflight health hazards to varying degrees. This pilot mission was initiated to gain further knowledge and monitor the physiological, psychological, and medical effects of long-duration exposure to spaceflight. METHODS: NASA's Human Research Program and the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Biomedical Problems identified more than 20 biomedical risk-reduction research investigations to be conducted on the two crewmembers before, during, and after their yearlong expedition. A database of results, as well as observations on programmatic resources, was collected to understand essential elements for future spaceflight health studies. RESULTS: Statistical rigor requires additional testing at a length of 1 yr to demonstrate the presence or absence of unacceptable deleterious effects, and to permit extrapolation to longer durations in space. Review of experimental procedures from this mission suggests potential efficiencies for future investigations. DISCUSSION: The Kelly-Kornienko 1-yr mission demonstrated the importance of continuing joint investigations with the adoption of standard measures for rigorous comparisons across disparate populations. It identified improvements to collaborative processes across national and international scientific research programs. Additional studies will inform the development of an integrated applied research methodology for the space station and future interplanetary expeditions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

Design/methodology/approach: A time-lagged survey design was used to gather data from flight attendants in Turkey. Structural equation modeling was used as the main analytic tool to assess these relationships. Findings: The relationships proposed in the authors’ study receive full support from the empirical data. Specifically, TIO is one of the immediate outcomes of SL that engenders job, career and life satisfaction at elevated levels. The results highlight the impacts of job and career satisfaction in the intermediate linkage between SL and life satisfaction. Practical implications: Management should train managerial employees to enhance the understanding of SL, which boosts flight attendants’ TIO. Management should invest in human resources through training and empowerment. This makes flight attendants perceive that management does not violate psychological contract. Such employees develop TIO that in turn engenders higher job, career and life satisfaction. It is also important to reward servant leaders when they succeed in making flight attendants develop TIO and motivating them to have higher job performance. Originality/value: Little is known about the consequences of SL in the extant service research. More importantly, there are still calls for research about the variables (e.g. TIO) mediating the relationship between SL and employee satisfaction outcomes. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2018,Spain,"Are crews empowered with all the resources needed to successfully address an inflight emergency? Checklists, a necessary but insufficient tool","<title>Are crews empowered with all the resources needed to successfully address an inflight emergency? Checklists, a necessary but insufficient tool</title> <abstract>Although safety in aviation has increased exponentially in recent decades, sadly, plane crashes will always be associated with the operation of the aviation world. The efforts should be directed towards the pursuit of “zero accidents”, providing aircrews with the necessary resources to minimize risks. One of the most important flight operation resources used in aviation is the checklist. However, when faced with an emergency, the crew cannot always make use of them, either because the huge diversity of potential emergencies does not allow to collect all of them in these manuals, or because the time available to react is so short that it makes it impossible to utilize them. This paper shows how aircraft checklists are a necessary but insufficient tool to solve complex, unpredictable, and novel emergencies. Furthermore, based on successfully solved critical events, the authors suggest the implementation of specific techniques for the learning and development of problem-solving programs focused on innovation and divergent thinking to decision making, as part of flight training, in order to increase the crews’ capability to face such emergencies. © 2018 The Author(s).</abstract>"
2018,Germany,Helicopter simulator performance prediction using the Random Forest method,"<title>Helicopter simulator performance prediction using the Random Forest method</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Different aspects of the aviation system, such as pilot's fitness, supervision, and working conditions, interact to produce or protect against flight safety hazards. Machine learning methods such as Random Forests may help identify system characteristics with the potential to affect flight safety from the large number of candidate predictors that results when multiple system levels are considered simultaneously. METHODS: There were 54 pilot-related and occupational candidate predictors of simulator flight performance in 2 malfunction scenarios completed by 51 male European helicopter emergency medical services pilots derived from pilots' self-report questionnaires and aeromedical examination records. In a cross-sectional explorative analysis, the Random Forest method was used to screen for informative predictors. Predictors scoring above the critical threshold for the conditional permutation variable importance (VI) statistic were selected. RESULTS: In five predictors, the VI statistic averaged across 2000 Random Forest runs exceeded the selection threshold: higher perceived rewards (VI = 0.0691) and predictability (VI = 0.0501) at work were associated with higher performance scores, and higher physiological dysregulation (VI = 0.0495) and alanine aminotransferase (VI = 0.0224) with lower scores. Performance also differed between the simulators at the two training sites (VI = 0.0298). DISCUSSION: Random Forests may usefully complement previously applied methods for the identification of human factors safety hazards. The identified performance predictors suggest further areas with potential for safety improvements. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

Despite use in many countries, little information is available regarding the predictive validity of the test. This study was designed to test the ability of the WOMBAT test to predict performance outcomes in a sample of ab-initio pilots. Sixty students commenced the study in 3 cohorts, and completed the WOMBAT test before their performance in the training program was evaluated through flight time to solo, flight time to licence level achievement, and instructor ratings of performance. Higher WOMBAT total scores were significantly related to reduced time to solo, achieving flight licences, as well as some early ratings of performance by flight instructors. Further research now needs to examine the exact nature of the skills and abilities that the test indexes in order to further improve pilot selection and training procedures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2018,China,Systematic assessment of intrinsic factors influencing visual attention performances in air traffic control via clustering algorithm and statistical inference,"<title>Systematic assessment of intrinsic factors influencing visual attention performances in air traffic control via clustering algorithm and statistical inference</title> <abstract>The intrinsic factors (IF) influencing visual attention performance (VAP) might cause potential human errors, such as “error/mistake”, “forgetting” and “omission”. It is a key issue to develop a systematic assessment of IF in order to distinguish the levels of VAP. Motivated by the Stimulus-Response (S-R) model, we take an interactive cancellation test-Neuron Type Test (NTT)-to explore the IF and present the corresponding systematic assessment. The main contributions of this work include three elements: a) modeling the IF on account of attention span, attention stability, distribution-shift of attention with measurable parameters by combining the psychological and statistical concepts; b) proposing quantitative analysis methods for assessing the IF via its computational representation-intrinsic qualities (IQ)-in the sense of computational model; and c) clustering the IQ of air traffic control (ATC) students in the feature space of interest. The response sequences of participants collected with the NTT system are characterized by three parameters: Hurst exponent, normalized number of decisions (NNoD) and error rate of decisions (ERD). The K-means clustering is applied to partition the feature space constructed from practical data of VAP. For the distinguishable clusters, the statistical inference is utilized to refine the assessment of IF. Our comprehensive analysis shows that the IQ can be classified into four levels, i.e., excellent, good, moderate and unqualified, which has a potential application in selecting air traffic controllers subject to reducing the risk of the inadequacy of attention performances in aviation safety management. ©: © 2018 Li et al.

2018,"Korea, Republic of",How and when are job crafters engaged at work?,"<title>How and when are job crafters engaged at work?</title> <abstract>The importance of work engagement and the lack of engaged employees have led researchers to focus on how to enhance employees’ levels of engagement in the workplace. Although job crafting as a principal driver of work engagement has recently received much attention from academics, little is known about the processes and conditions in which employees who craft their tasks become engaged. In order to address these research gaps, we hypothesize that psychological capital (PsyCap) is likely to mediate the association between job crafting and work engagement, and that coworker support, rather than supervisor support, is likely to moderate the relationship between job crafting and PsyCap. Further, we integrated these hypotheses and tested the moderated mediation effect. Using survey data from 175 flight attendants in South Korea, we found the results to be in line with our expectations. The findings of this empirical research contribute to the understanding of how and when job crafters become engaged at work. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</abstract>"
2018,United States,Subtypes of severe psychological distress among US Air Force remote warriors: A latent class analysis,"<title>Subtypes of severe psychological distress among US Air Force remote warriors: A latent class analysis</title> <abstract>US Air Force remote warrior personnel include a range of military personnel composed of remotely piloted aircraft aircrew, intelligence operators, and cyber warfare operators. Job duties in these professions entail long work hours, rotating shifts, and regular engagement in combat operations. Although research has identified a number of factors correlated with elevated burnout and emotional distress in this population, little is known about the unique needs of discrete subgroups of distressed personnel. In a sample of 7,550 US Air Force remote warriors, results of latent class analysis yielded four distinct classes. Three of the four reported moderately elevated burnout and job dissatisfaction but differed with respect to demographics and development career stage. The fourth group reported significantly higher levels of emotional distress, burnout, job dissatisfaction, and problems in living. This latter group was comparable to the mid-career group with respect to demographics, although this group had much lower levels of responsibility and indicators of career advancement. Results suggest that, among remote warrior personnel, there are several subtypes of elevated emotional distress. Prevention and intervention strategies that are matched to each subtype may yield better occupational and mental health outcomes than universal, “one size fits all” strategies. © 2018, © 2018 Society for Military Psychology, Division 19 of the American Psychological Association.</abstract>"

2018,Australia,Cognitive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions for Unmanned Aircraft,"<title>Cognitive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions for Unmanned Aircraft</title> <abstract>This paper presents the concept of Cognitive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (CHMI2) for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Ground Control Stations (GCS). CHMI2 represents a new approach to aviation human factors engineering that introduces adaptive functionalities in the design of operators’ command, control and display functions. A CHMI2 system assesses human cognitive states based on measurement of key psycho-physiological observables. The cognitive states are used to predict and enhance operator performance in the accomplishment of aviation tasks, with the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall human-machine teaming. The CHMI2 system presented in this paper employs a four-layer architecture comprising sensing, extraction, classification and adaptation functionalities. An overview of each layer is provided along with the layer’s metrics, algorithms and functions. Two relevant case studies are presented to illustrate the interactions between the different layers, and the conceptual design of the associated display formats is described. The results indicate that specific eye tracking variables provide discrimination between different modes of control. Furthermore, results indicate that the higher levels of automation supported by the CHMI2 are beneficial in Separation Assurance and Collision Avoidance (SA&CA) scenarios involving low-detectability obstacles and stringent time constraints to implement recovery manoeuvres. These preliminary results highlight that the introduction of CHMI2 functionalities in future UAS can significantly reduce reaction time and enhance operational effectiveness of unmanned aircraft response to collision and loss of separation events, as well as improve the overall safety and efficiency of operations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</abstract>"

As a neglected theory in organizational research, attribution theory is used to link psychological entitlement to interpersonal and organizational deviant behavior through the mediating effect of egoistic deprivation. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was conducted in governmental and public airline companies in Iran. The survey yielded 294 effective questionnaires. Study relationships were gauged using structural equation modeling. Findings: According to the results, psychological entitlement boosts cabin crews’ egoistic deprivation and interpersonal and organizational deviant behavior. Consistent with hypothesized proposition, cabin crews’ egoistic deprivation fosters interpersonal deviant behavior. Particularly, it appears that egoistic deprivation among cabin crews partially mediates the effect of psychological entitlement on interpersonal deviant behavior. Contrary to the authors’ prediction, egoistic deprivation does not act as the mediator in the relationship between psychological entitlement and organizational deviant behavior. Originality/value: This study sheds light on relatively limited psychological entitlement literature by extending attribution theory to cabin crews’ deprivation and workplace deviant behavior. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2018,Hungary,Digital Health Technologies to Support Human Missions to Mars,"<title>Digital Health Technologies to Support Human Missions to Mars</title> <abstract>The first human missions to Mars are scheduled for the 2030s. Besides the already known physical and psychological challenges related to spaceflights, a mission to Mars will pose even more health threats to astronauts and increase the need for maintaining a rigorous lifestyle for years. Mission control has always played the key role in providing care for the flight crew with advanced medical technologies. However, the need for medical assistance will increase due to the length of the mission, the time delay in communication, and the limited medical resources on board. Similar to how ""digital health"" is shaping healthcare with disruptive technologies, a new approach could be required in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring crew members' health on board. Healthcare is transitioning from a hierarchy to a collaborative partnership between patients and caregivers. Just as empowered patients are getting involved in their care, astronauts also need to gain experience in using new technologies to keep a rigorously healthy lifestyle and participate in medical decision-making.

2018,Czechia,The Giant Hand illusion experienced on a simulator,"<title>The Giant Hand illusion experienced on a simulator</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: This paper discusses a special kind of a sensory illusion-the Giant Hand illusion-that was experienced during an exercise on a flight simulator equipped with a VR headset. In the first part we describe spatial disorientation and the function of the vestibular apparatus during flight and its consequences. In this part, the sensory illusion simulator used for the experiment is mentioned. In the second part we describe the simulator and test flight. In the third part we discuss data retrieved during simulator flights that are important for explaining the Giant Hand illusion. CASE REPORT: A well-trained pilot experienced the Giant Hand illusion while executing instrument flight rules flight on a simulator. The Giant Hand illusion was detected from the simulation data and confirmed by the pilot afterward. DISCUSSION: The Giant Hand illusion is a rare type of sensory illusion. The pilot falsely evaluated the situation as a malfunction of the aircraft controls. If the pilot had not been informed by the operator that he might have been influenced by the illusion, he would probably have crashed the simulated aircraft. An unrecognized Giant Hand illusion during a flight can lead to fatal consequences. This case report shows the symptoms and data that can be used for early recognition of this type of illusion. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

METHOD: In a hypobaric chamber, 16 military helicopter pilots were randomly exposed to 4 altitudes and 3 physical exertion levels. After each exercise period, participants identified targets on a designated flight path on a desktop simulator and completed a cognitive test battery. Cerebral regional and finger pulse oxyhemoglobin saturation levels (rSO<inf>2</inf> and S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf>), heart and respiration rates were continuously monitored. Participants indicated their symptoms, mood and fatigue. RESULTS: rSO<inf>2</inf> and S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> were affected by the increase of altitude and exercise level. Target identification accuracy and latency within the simulated flight task showed decrements at 8K, 10K (3048 m), 12K (3658 m), and 14K. Cognitive performance was degraded at 14K. More than 60% of the participants at 8K and 10K and more than 80% at 12K and 14K reported symptoms. Altitude increased symptoms, negative mood, general fatigue, and physical fatigue. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate a significant influence of mild HH on a number of outcome measures at altitudes above 10K, where operational restrictions are well established. In contrast, there was no clear influence of HH on performance at lower altitudes (i.e., 8K and 10K). The occurrence of HH symptoms and the decrements in target identification latency and accuracy at 8K and 10K may negatively impact flight performance and require further study. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2018,Portugal,Cognitive impact and psychophysiological effects of stress using a biomonitoring platform,"<title>Cognitive impact and psychophysiological effects of stress using a biomonitoring platform</title> <abstract>Stress can impact multiple psychological and physiological human domains. In order to better understand the effect of stress on cognitive performance, and whether this effect is related to an autonomic response to stress, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used as a testing platform along with a 2-Choice Reaction Time Task. When considering the nature and importance of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) work and the fact that they are subjected to high levels of stress, this study was conducted with a sample of ATCs (n = 11). Linear Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features were extracted from ATCs electrocardiogram (ECG) acquired using a medical-grade wearable ECG device (Vital Jacket® (1-Lead, Biodevices S.A, Matosinhos, Portugal)). Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were also used to measure perceived stress. TSST produced statistically significant changes in some HRV parameters (Average of normal-to-normal intervals (AVNN), Standard Deviation of all NN (SDNN), root mean square of differences between successive rhythm-to-rhythm (RR) intervals (RMSSD), pNN20, and LF/HF) and subjective measures of stress, which recovered after the stress task. Although these short-term changes in HRV showed a tendency to normalize, an impairment on cognitive performance was evident. Despite that participant’s reaction times were lower, the accuracy significantly decreased, presenting more errors after performing the acute stress event. Results can also point to the importance of the development of quantified occupational health (qOHealth) devices to allow for the monitoring of stress responses. © 2018 by the authors.

Based on the data collected, we developed and validated a model which integrates personality, workload and affective theories. Our results indicate that the difficulty of an air traffic control task has a direct influence on cognitive workload as well as on the self-reported mood; whereas both mood and workload seem to change independently. In addition, we show that personality, in particular neuroticism, affects both mood and performance of the participants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

We included participants with age between 20 and 65 years. Data were collected using a predesigned electronic questionnaire composed of questions related to demographic information in addition to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Berlin Questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: The study included 328 pilots with a mean age ± standard deviation of 41.4 ± 9.7 years. Overall, 224 (68.3%) pilots had an FSS score ≥ 36 indicating severe fatigue and 221 (67.4%) reported making mistakes in the cockpit because of fatigue. One hundred and twelve (34.1%) pilots had an ESS score ≥ 10 indicating excessive daytime sleepiness and 148 (45.1%) reported falling asleep at the controls at least once without previously agreeing with their colleagues. One hundred and thirteen (34.5%) pilots had an abnormal HADS depression score (≥ 8), and 96 (29.3%) pilots were at high risk for OSA requiring further assessment. Conclusion: Fatigue, sleepiness, risk of OSA, and depression are prevalent among GCC commercial airline pilots. Regular assessment by aviation authorities is needed to detect and treat these medical problems. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.</abstract>"
2018,"Taiwan, Province of China",Long-term predictive models of risk factors for early chronic kidney disease: A longitudinal study,"<title>Long-term predictive models of risk factors for early chronic kidney disease: A longitudinal study</title> <abstract>Background: The high incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Taiwan have produced tremendous burdens on health care resources. The work environment of air force special operations personnel engenders high psychological stress, and the resulting increased blood pressure can lead to glomerular hypertension and accelerated glomerular injury in the long term. The aim of the study was to establish the predictive models to define the predictors of CKD. Results: The results indicated that the prevalence of CKD over 4 consecutive years was 3.8%, 9.4%, 9.0%, and 9.4%. The capability of using occult blood in urine to predict the risk of CKD after 1, 2, and 3 years was statistically significant. The ageadjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 7.94 (95% CI: 2.61- 24.14), 12.35 (95% CI: 4.02-37.94) and 4.25 (95% CI: 1.32-13.70), respectively. Discussion: The predictive power of occult blood in urine for the risk of CKD in each model was statistically significant. Future investigations can explore the feasibility of implementing simple and accurate urine dipsticks for preliminary testing besides annual aircrew physical examinations to facilitate early detection and treatment. Methods: This study was a longitudinal study, in which air force special operations personnel who received physical examinations at military hospitals between 2004 and 2010 were selected. CKD was determined based on the definition provided by the US National Kidney Foundation. Overall, 212 participants that could be followed continuously for 4 years were analyzed. © Wu et al.</abstract>"
2018,Germany,Attitude Indicator Design in Primary Flight Display: Revisiting an Old Issue With Current Technology,"<title>Attitude Indicator Design in Primary Flight Display: Revisiting an Old Issue With Current Technology</title> <abstract>Objective: The experiments investigated the “old issue” of the attitude indicator’s moving-horizon versus moving-aircraft format with current primary flight display technology. Of interest was whether the effects found in earlier studies, favoring the moving-aircraft format, could be replicated with most recent technology including extended horizon displays, which depict the artificial horizon extended over the whole screen with overlaying speed and altitude scales (e.g., B787). Background: Although the moving-horizon format represents the standard approach in Western aviation, human factors research from the 1950s to the 1970s with round electromechanical instruments favored the moving-aircraft format with respect to better support of flight-path tracking and unusual attitude recoveries. However, recent studies using laboratory displays more similar to modern primary flight displays provided inconsistent results. This led to the assumption that the display’s design is a moderating factor of those effects. Method: Thirty-two novices and 13 pilots flew several tracking and recovery tasks in a PC-based simulator equipped with moving-horizon and moving-aircraft formats in classic and extended horizon design. Results: The data show that the previous effects favoring a moving-aircraft format of displaying bank information can be replicated with current primary flight display designs. However, the extended horizon design seems to reduce this effect, at least for pilots. Conclusion: The results suggest reconsidering the format of the attitude indicator at least for new applications, such as control of remotely piloted aircraft. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2018,Japan - United States,Vape and Aviate: Electronic-Cigarette Use and Misuse in Naval Aviation,"<title>Vape and Aviate: Electronic-Cigarette Use and Misuse in Naval Aviation</title> <abstract>Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (EC) are an emerging form of nicotine replacement that has had a discernible increase in prevalence in the general population. Little is known regarding EC use among different military demographic groups or the extent of influence that social determinants of health may have on the behavior. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of EC use in a select population of active duty U.S. Naval personnel. This study is unique in that it allows for EC behavior comparison between a traditionally healthy demographic (aviators, a subset of aircrew) and a representative general military population sample. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected anonymously and analyzed in 2015-2016. Active duty Naval personnel (n = 977) were asked about ever trying ECs, frequency of use, and when was the last time an EC was used. Participants were assessed similarly regarding cigarette use. Descriptive and inferential statistics as well as multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted using categorical and ordinal variables assigned to usage and demographic factors. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Naval Hospital Portsmouth located in Portsmouth, Virginia. Results: Within the study population, 31.4% have tried ECs, 9.3% were current users, and only 3.8% were dual (EC and cigarettes) users. EC use was significantly associated with paygrade (enlisted), primary job duty (non-aircrew), and education (less than a bachelor degree, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively). ECs were used at some point as a smoking cessation tool for 43.6% of current EC users (p < 0.001), 21.6% of current smokers, and only 5.6% of former smokers. Continued EC use after ever trying ECs (30.0%) was only slightly more prevalent as continued cigarette use after ever trying cigarettes (27.3%). Smokers were nearly five times more likely to currently use ECs compared with non-smokers. Trying cigarettes was associated with nearly 12 times the risk for trying ECs compared with those who never tried cigarettes. No significant misuse of ECs was noted; however, several cases of drinking, tasting, and touching EC fluid were reported. Conclusion: This study is unique in that it examines the use of electronic cigarettes among selected healthy and baseline groups within the active duty U.S. Navy population. The current prevalence of EC use among active duty personnel is much higher than previously thought. Continued use of ECs after ever trying them appears to exceed that of cigarettes even among healthy populations such as aircrew. The findings of increased risk of EC use among those with lower income and less than a bachelor's degree suggest social determinants of health implications. This study sheds new light on EC use, characteristics of use, addiction implications, and highlights concerns for a growing health risk behavior. © 2018 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2018.

By questionnaire survey, this study investigated 375 flight attendants of China Airlines based in Taiwan, and validated the hypotheses through hierarchical regression analysis. The results showed that flight attendants with high psychological capital tend to show more work engagement and better service behavior. Moreover, work engagement is the mediator between psychological capital and service behavior. According to the moderated mediating result, the impact of service climate in the mediating process is originated from the positive relationship of service climate with work engagement and service behavior. In other words, the mediating the effect of work engagement changes with service climate. Finally, based on the research findings, this study proposes managerial implications as reference for internal marketing of airlines. © 2017</abstract>"

Method: A cohort study of Royal Canadian Air Force aircrew veterans. We used Short Form–36 (SF-36) measures of mental and physical functioning collected prospectively at six time points between 1996 to 2006 (734 men with a mean age of 85.5 [SD 3.0] years in 2006) to determine trajectories. Continued contact with the cohort from 2006 to 2015 determined subsequent mortality. Results: Men were more likely to maintain high levels of mental functioning than physical functioning. Thirty-seven percent of participants maintained a high level of both mental and physical functioning. Declining function in either mental or physical function was associated with lower survival. Conclusion: Men who maintain physical and mental functioning have a lower mortality rate. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.</abstract>"
2018,United States,The effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation,"<title>The effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation</title> <abstract>This laboratory experiment was designed to study the effect of metacognitive monitoring feedback on performance in a computer-based training simulation. According to prior research on metacognition, the accurate checking of learning is a critical part of improving the quality of human performance. However, only rarely have researchers studied the learning effects of the accurate checking of retrospective confidence judgments (RCJs) during a computer-based military training simulation. In this study, we provided participants feedback screens after they had completed a warning task and identification task in a radar monitoring simulation. There were two groups in this experiment. One group (group A) viewed the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft and the triangular graphs of both RCJ scores and human performance together. The other group (group B) only watched the feedback screens with the flight path of all target aircraft. There was no significant difference in performance improvement between groups A and B for the warning task (Day 1: group A – 0.347, group B – 0.305; Day 2: group A – 0.488, group B – 0.413). However, the identification task yielded a significant difference in performance improvement between these groups (Day 1: group A – 0.174, group B – 0.1555; Day 2: group A – 0.324, group B – 0.199). The results show that debiasing self-judgment of the identification task produces a positive training effect on learners. The findings of this study will be beneficial for designing an advanced instructional strategy in a simulation-based training environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

Based on a comprehensive approach to the problem of stress, we have decided to evaluate all components of a stress response – immunological (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, CRP, TNF-alpha) and hormonal one (CRH, ACTH), as well as to evaluate the psychological indicators of stress, coping with stress, and controlling emotional reactions as psychological markers that predispose to the most beneficial adaption in relation to stressors affecting flight personnel taking part in peace missions abroad. Material and method. The research studies being the subject matter of the project were conducted among 113 antiterrorists and 123 representatives of aircrew (236 respondents in total) who participated in peace missions outside Poland. The study was conducted both before departure and during the missions. The study included a biochemical evaluation (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, CRP, TNF-alpha, CRH, ACTH) as well as a psychological assessment based on the Perceived Stress Scale by S. Cohen (PSS-10) and the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS) by M. Watson and S. Greer, and the COPE Inventory by J. Carver. Results. Based on a statistical analysis of the variables, a relationship between the level of perceived stress and the methods of coping with it as well as between the selected methods of emotion control and inflammatory response indicators, was found. Conclusions. In difficult situations, accompanied by an increase in the variables responsible for the biochemical inflammatory response of an organism, the effective model of coping with difficult situations and emotion control increases, while the subjective level of perceived stress drops. © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association.

2018,Portugal,A wearable system for the stress monitoring of air traffic controllers during an air traffic control refresher training and the trier social stress test: A comparative study,"<title>A wearable system for the stress monitoring of air traffic controllers during an air traffic control refresher training and the trier social stress test: A comparative study</title> <abstract>Background: Air Traffic Control (ATC) is a complex and demanding process, exposing Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) to high stress. Recently, efforts have been made in ATC to maintain safety and efficiency in the face of increasing air traffic demands. Computer simulations have been a useful tool for ATC training, improving ATCs skills and consequently traffic safety. Objectives: This study aims to: a) evaluate psychophysiological indices of stress in an ATC simulation environment using a wearable biomonitoring platform. In order to obtain a measure of ATCs stress levels, results from an experimental study with the same participants, that included a stress-induced task were used as a stress ground truth; b) understand if there are differences in stress levels of ATCs with different job functions (“advisors” vs “operationals”) when performing an ATC Refresher Training, in a simulator environment. Methods: Two studies were conducted with ATCs: Study 1, that included a stress-induced task - the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and Study 2, that included an ATC simulation task. Linear Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features from ATCs were acquired using a medical grade wearable Electrocardiogram (ECG) device. Self-reports were used to measure perceived stress. Results: TSST was self-reported as being much more stressful than the simulation task. Physiological data supports these results. Results from study 2 showed more stress among the “advisors” group when comparing to the “operational” group. Conclusion: Results point to the importance of the development of quantified Occupational Health (qOHealth) devices to allow monitoring and differentiation of ATCs stress responses. © 2018 Donato and Denaro.</abstract>"
2018,Poland,A machine learning approach to the detection of pilot's reaction to unexpected events based on EEG signals,"<title>A machine learning approach to the detection of pilot's reaction to unexpected events based on EEG signals</title> <abstract>This work considers the problem of utilizing electroencephalographic signals for use in systems designed for monitoring and enhancing the performance of aircraft pilots. Systems with such capabilities are generally referred to as cognitive cockpits. This article provides a description of the potential that is carried by such systems, especially in terms of increasing flight safety. Additionally, a neuropsychological background of the problem is presented. Conducted research was focused mainly on the problem of discrimination between states of brain activity related to idle but focused anticipation of visual cue and reaction to it. Especially, a problem of selecting a proper classification algorithm for such problems is being examined. For that purpose an experiment involving 10 subjects was planned and conducted. Experimental electroencephalographic data was acquired using an Emotiv EPOC+ headset. Proposed methodology involved use of a popular method in biomedical signal processing, the Common Spatial Pattern, extraction of bandpower features, and an extensive test of different classification algorithms, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks. © 2018 Bartosz Binias et al.</abstract>"
2018,Netherlands,"Pilot mental health, negative life events, and improving safety with peer support and a just culture","<title>Pilot mental health, negative life events, and improving safety with peer support and a just culture</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: In the last 35 yr, 17 commercial aviation accidents and incidents, with 576 fatalities, could likely have been attributed to mental disease of a pilot. Screening tools for mental health risks in airline pilots are needed. There is growing interest in pilot peer-support programs and how to incorporate them in a just culture, meaning that pilots can report mental health complaints without a risk of job or income loss. We combined findings from aviation accidents and incidents with a search of scientific literature to provide data-based recommendations for screening, peer-support, and a just culture approach to mental health problems. METHODS: Commercial aviation accidents and incidents in which a mental disorder of a pilot was thought to play a role were reviewed. Subsequently, PubMed and PsychInfo literature searches were performed on peer-support programs, just culture human resource management, and the risk of negative life events on developing suicidal ideation and behavior in comparable professional groups. RESULTS: Lethal accidents were mostly related to impaired coping with negative life events. Negative life events are clearly related to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completed suicide. A protective effect of peer-support programs on mental health problems has not been established, although peer-support programs are generally appreciated by those involved. We did not find relevant literature on just culture. DISCUSSION: Negative life events are likely a useful screening tool for mental health risks. There is still a lack of evidence on how peer-support groups should be designed and how management of mental health risks can be implemented in a just culture. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

Methods: Fifty-two ATC officers participated, based at three air traffic control units, identified as A, B and C. Stress symptoms were assessed using the Lipp Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults, and EDS by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: The sample mean age was 37 years, 76.9% of whom were male. Excessive daytime sleepiness was identified in 25% of the ATC officers, with 84.6% of these based at air traffic control unit A, which has greater air traffic flow, operating a 24-hour alternating work shift schedule. A total of 16% of the ATC officers had stress symptoms, and of these, 62% showed a predominance of physical symptoms. Conclusion: The high percentage of ATC officers with EDS identified in group A may be related to chronodisruption due to night work and alternating shifts. © 2017, Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria.

2017,United States,The aging physician and the medical profession a review,"<title>The aging physician and the medical profession a review</title> <abstract>IMPORTANCE: The issue of the aging physician and when to cease practice has been controversial for many years. There are reports of prominent physicians who practiced after becoming dangerous in old age, but the profession has not demonstrated the ability to prevent this. A mandatory retirement age could be discriminatory and take many competent physicians out of practice and risk a physician shortage. An increasing body of evidence regarding the relationship between physicians' age and performance has led organizations, such as the American College of Surgeons, to revisit this challenge. OBSERVATIONS: Since 1975, the number of practicing physicians older than 65 years in the United States has increased by more than 374%, and in 2015, 23% of practicing physicians were65 years orolder. Research shows that between ages40 and 75 years, the mean cognitive ability declines by more than 20%, but there is significant variability from one person to another, indicating that while some older physicians are profoundly impaired, others retain their ability and skills. There are age-based requirements for periodic testing and/or retirement for many professions including pilots, judges, air traffic controllers, Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, and firefighters. While there are not similar requirements for physicians, a few hospitals have introduced mandatory age-based evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: As physicians age, a required cognitive evaluation combined with a confidential, anonymous feedback evaluation by peers and coworkers regarding wellness and competence would be beneficial both to physicians and their patients. While it is unlikely that this will become a national standard soon, individual health care organizations could develop policies similar to those present at a few US institutions. In addition, large professional organizations should identify a range of acceptable policies to address the aging physician while leaving institutions flexibility to customize the approach. Absent robust professional initiatives in this area, regulators and legislators may impose more draconian measures. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2017,United Kingdom,Predicting jet lag in long-haul cabin crew: The role of illness cognitions and behaviour,"<title>Predicting jet lag in long-haul cabin crew: The role of illness cognitions and behaviour</title> <abstract>Objective: Established risk factors for jet lag are mostly physiological including circadian preference, age, gender, the number of flight zones crossed and to some extent direction of travel. Some research has also highlighted a role for psychosocial factors including sleep, diet and ‘circadian’ health behaviours and illness cognitions although this remains relatively untested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sleep, diet and illness cognitions in predicting perceived jet lag amongst long-haul crew. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a longitudinal study. Profile characteristics (including chronotype), preparation strategies (sleep, eating and ‘circadian’ behaviours) and illness cognitions were measured at baseline (before a trip). Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) was measured on the crews’ second day off (post-trip). Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that unidimensional jet lag was predicted by the belief in a cyclical timeline, whereas multidimensional jet lag was predicted by multidimensional jet lag at baseline and to a lesser extent by identity. No role was found for profile characteristics and preparation strategies. Conclusion: Illness cognitions partly explain the experience of perceived jet lag in long-haul cabin crew indicating that jet lag is in part a psycho-social construct, not just a biological one. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2017,Australia - Finland - Saudi Arabia - United Kingdom - United States,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and fatal accidents in aviation medicine,"<title>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and fatal accidents in aviation medicine</title> <abstract>Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning and/or development. ADHD occurs in about 2.5% of adults. ADHD can be an excluding medical condition among pilots due to the risk of attentional degradation and therefore impact on flight safety. Diagnosis of ADHD is complex, which complicates aeromedical assessment. This study highlights fatal accident cases among pilots with ADHD and discusses protocols to detect its presence to help to assess its importance to flight safety. methods: To identify fatal accidents in aviation (including airplanes, helicopters, balloons, and gliders) in the United States between the years 2000 to 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database was searched with the terms ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). results: The NTSB database search for fatal aviation accidents possibly associated with ADHD yielded four accident cases of interest in the United States [4/4894 (0.08%)]. Two of the pilots had ADHD diagnosed by a doctor, one was reported by a family member, and one by a flight instructor. An additional five cases were identified searching for ADD [5/4894 (0.1%)]. Altogether, combined ADHD and ADD cases yielded nine accident cases of interest (0.18%). discussion: It is generally accepted by aviation regulatory authorities that ADHD is a disqualifying neurological condition. Yet FAA and CASA provide specific protocols for tailor-made pilot assessment. Accurate evaluation of ADHD is essential because of its potential negative impact on aviation safety. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Germany - Netherlands,I spy with my little eye: Analysis of airline pilots’ gaze patterns in a manual instrument flight scenario,"<title>I spy with my little eye: Analysis of airline pilots’ gaze patterns in a manual instrument flight scenario</title> <abstract>The aim of this study was to analyze pilots’ visual scanning in a manual approach and landing scenario. Manual flying skills suffer from increasing use of automation. In addition, predominantly long-haul pilots with only a few opportunities to practice these skills experience this decline. Airline pilots representing different levels of practice (short-haul vs. long-haul) had to perform a manual raw data precision approach while their visual scanning was recorded by an eye-tracking device. The analysis of gaze patterns, which are based on predominant saccades, revealed one main group of saccades among long-haul pilots. In contrast, short-haul pilots showed more balanced scanning using two different groups of saccades. Short-haul pilots generally demonstrated better manual flight performance and within this group, one type of scan pattern was found to facilitate the manual landing task more. Long-haul pilots tend to utilize visual scanning behaviors that are inappropriate for the manual ILS landing task. This lack of skills needs to be addressed by providing specific training and more practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2017,Netherlands,Flight performance during exposure to acute hypobaric hypoxia,"<title>Flight performance during exposure to acute hypobaric hypoxia</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of hypobaric hypoxia (HH) on a pilot's flight performance during exposure to simulated altitudes of 91, 3048, and 4572 m (300, 10,000, and 15,000 ft) and to monitor the pilot's physiological reactions. METHOD: In a single-blinded counter-balanced design, 12 male pilots were exposed to HH while flying in a flight simulator that had been placed in a hypobaric chamber. Flight performance of the pilots, pilot's alertness level, S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf>, heart rate (HR), minute ventilation (V<inf>E</inf>), and breathing frequency (BF) were measured. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in Flight Profile Accuracy (FPA) between the three altitudes. Post hoc analysis showed no significant difference in performance between 91 m and 3048 m. A trend was observed at 4572 m, suggesting a decrease in flight performance at that altitude. Significantly lower alertness levels were observed at the start of the flight at 4572 m compared to 91 m, and at the end of the flight at 4572 m compared to the start at that altitude. S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> and BF decreased, and HR increased significantly with altitude. DISCUSSION: The present study did not provide decisive evidence for a decrease in flight performance during exposure to simulated altitudes of 3048 and 4572 m. However, large interindividual variation in pilots' flight performance combined with a gradual decrease in alertness levels observed in the present study puts into question the ability of pilots to safely fly an aircraft while exposed to these altitudes without supplemental oxygen. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Canada - China,Human performance time model of spacecraft control panel operation in simulated microgravity,"<title>Human performance time model of spacecraft control panel operation in simulated microgravity</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Human performance modeling plays an important role in the design and management of human spaceflight missions. Previous studies reported that manual control task time increased in microgravity conditions. The current study aimed to find a modeling method that can quantify and predict the task time of spacecraft control panel operation in the simulated microgravity condition. METHODS: We proposed the application of a predetermined elemental task method together with an information processing time model to quantify both physical motion time and cognitive time. The time increment due to microgravity was hypothesized to be proportional to physical motion time. The total task time in the microgravity condition could be calculated as the model time from the normal ground condition plus the predicted time increment. Human data were collected from an experiment asking participants to perform six emergency operating procedure tasks in both normal ground and simulated microgravity conditions. RESULTS: The proposed method resulted in good fitness to human data in both conditions, as shown by both regression fitness (R2 values = 0.99) and modeling error measures (root mean square error ≤ 3.3 s; mean absolute percentage error ≤ 16.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although the method has its limitations, the current findings suggest that it has value in aerospace human factors and ergonomics applications. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Enhancing the meaningfulness of work for astronauts on long duration space exploration missions,"<title>Enhancing the meaningfulness of work for astronauts on long duration space exploration missions</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Numerous authors have identified the stressors likely to be encountered on long duration space exploration missions (e.g., to Mars), including the possibility of significant crises, separation from family, boredom/monotony, and interpersonal conflict. Although many authors have noted that meaningful work may be beneficial for astronauts on these missions, none have detailed the sources of meaningful work for astronauts and how these sources may differ between astronauts. The present article identifies how engagement in meaningful work during long duration missions may mitigate the adverse effects of demands and increase the potential for benefits resulting from the missions. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine NASA personnel, including astronauts, flight directors, and flight surgeons. Questions addressed sources of meaning for astronauts, characteristics of tasks that enhance vs. detract from meaning, and recommendations for enhancing meaning. RESULTS: Personnel mentioned contributing to humanity and the next generation, contributing to the mission, and exploration as the most meaningful aspects of their work. Characteristics of tasks that enhanced meaning included using a variety of skills, feeling personal control over their schedule, autonomy in the execution of tasks, and understanding the importance of the experiments conducted on the mission. Top recommendations to sustain meaning were insuring social needs were met through such activities as the strategic use of social media, giving astronauts autonomy as well as structure, and conducting training during transit. DISCUSSION: Implications are addressed for tailoring meaning-based interventions for astronauts participating on long duration missions and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Austria - Czechia - Germany - Greece - Italy - Lithuania - Netherlands - United Kingdom,Health effects of airline cabin environments in simulated 8-hour flights,"<title>Health effects of airline cabin environments in simulated 8-hour flights</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Commercial air travel is usually without health incidents. However, there is a view that cabin environments may be detrimental to health, especially flights of 8 h or more. Concerns have been raised about deep vein thrombosis, upper respiratory tract infections, altitude sickness, and toxins from the engines. METHODS: Passenger cabin simulators were used to achieve a comparative observational study with 8-h flights at pressures equivalent to terrestrial altitudes of ground, 4000, 6000, and 8000 ft. Biomarkers of thrombosis (D-Dimer), inflammation (interleukin-6), and respiratory dysfunction (FEV<inf>1</inf>) and oxygen saturation (S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf>) were measured, as well as pulse and blood pressure. The wellbeing of the passengers was also monitored. RESULTS: During 36 flights, 1260 healthy subjects [626 women (F) and 634 men (M) (mean age = 43, SD = 16)] were assessed. Additionally, 72 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (F = 32, M = 40, mean age = 48, SD = 17) and 74 with heart failure (F = 50, M = 24, mean age = 54, SD = 14) contributed to 11 flights. Additionally, 76 normal controls were observed while engaged in a usual day's work (F = 38, M = 38, mean age = 39, SD = 15). There were no healthsignificant changes in D-Dimer, interleukin-6, or FEV<inf>1</inf>. S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> varied as expected, with lowest values at 8000 ft and in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. The only differences from the controls were the loss of the normal diurnal variations in interleukin-6 and D-Dimer. DISCUSSION: This very large, comparative, controlled study provides much reassurance for the traveling public, who use airline flights of up to 8 h. We did not show evidence of the development of venous thrombosis, inflammation, respiratory embarrassment, nor passenger distress. No significant symptoms or adverse effects were reported. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Cognitive deterioration in moderate and severe hypobaric hypoxia conditions,"<title>Cognitive deterioration in moderate and severe hypobaric hypoxia conditions</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Hypoxia continues to present risks in military aviation. Hypoxia symptoms include sensory and cognitive effects; of these, it is important to identify which components of operator performance are most vulnerable to hypoxia-induced decline in order to determine which sensory modality is most effective for alerting an impaired aviator of an imminent hypoxic episode. METHODS: A study was performed in a hypobaric chamber to characterize deterioration of cognitive performance under moderate (MH) and severe (SH) hypoxia conditions, culminating in subjects' inability to perform tasks. Subjects operated a synthetic workstation, performing multiple simultaneous tasks during hypobaric exposures equivalent to 5486 m (18,000 ft) MH and 7620 m (25,000 ft) SH ascents. Performance was compared across baseline, altitude exposure, and recovery periods within MH vs. SH altitude profiles. Ascents lasted until at least one of a list of termination criteria was met, at which point the chamber was returned to ground level pressure and the subject resumed workstation performance during recovery. RESULTS: SH conditions generated greater deficits than MH conditions, and these more severe effects hastened the termination of exposures (5 vs. 18 min mean duration, respectively). Workstation performance collapsed rapidly on SH exposure, with Mathematics and Auditory Monitoring tasks proving vulnerable to breakdown. In MH exposures, these tasks exhibited impaired accuracy (declining 11% and 9%, respectively) and speed, with declines in Auditory Monitoring lingering into recovery. DISCUSSION: The relative robustness of memory and visual monitoring vs. the vulnerability of mathematical and auditory processing suggest that care should be taken designing purely auditory cockpit hypoxia warning alerts. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,United States,The effects of training on anxiety and task performance in simulated suborbital spaceflight,"<title>The effects of training on anxiety and task performance in simulated suborbital spaceflight</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: In commercial spaceflight, anxiety could become mission-impacting, causing negative experiences or endangering the flight itself. We studied layperson response to four varied-length training programs (ranging from 1 h-2 d of preparation) prior to centrifuge simulation of launch and re-entry acceleration profiles expected during suborbital spaceflight. We examined subject task execution, evaluating performance in high-stress conditions. We sought to identify any trends in demographics, hemodynamics, or similar factors in subjects with the highest anxiety or poorest tolerance of the experience. METHODS: Volunteers participated in one of four centrifuge training programs of varied complexity and duration, culminating in two simulated suborbital spaceflights. At most, subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d, including two +G<inf>z</inf> runs (peak +3.5 G<inf>z</inf>, Run 2) and two +G<inf>x</inf> runs (peak +6.0 G<inf>x</inf>, Run 4) followed by three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G<inf>x</inf> and +G<inf>z</inf>, peak +6.0 G<inf>x</inf> and +4.0 G<inf>z</inf>). Two cohorts also received dedicated anxietymitigation training. Subjects were evaluated on their performance on various tasks, including a simulated emergency. RESULTS: Participating in 2-7 centrifuge exposures were 148 subjects (105 men, 43 women, age range 19-72 yr, mean 39.4 ± 13.2 yr, body mass index range 17.3-38.1, mean 25.1 ± 3.7). There were 10 subjects who withdrew or limited their G exposure; history of motion sickness was associated with opting out. Shorter length training programs were associated with elevated hemodynamic responses. Single-directional G training did not significantly improve tolerance. DISCUSSION: Training programs appear best when high fidelity and sequential exposures may improve tolerance of physical/ psychological flight stressors. The studied variables did not predict anxiety-related responses to these centrifuge profiles. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Sweden,Impossible meals? The food and meal situation of flight attendants in Scandinavia – A qualitative interview study,"<title>Impossible meals? The food and meal situation of flight attendants in Scandinavia – A qualitative interview study</title> <abstract>The working conditions of flight attendants (FAs) often involve extended and irregular working hours, short rest periods, difficulties in planning for breaks and high demands of service provision. Moreover, work schedules including early check-in, shifts during circadian low and time-zone transitions imply constant exposure to alterations in circadian systems and related health risks. The aim of this explorative study was to investigate how the organisation of work, time and place influence the food and meal situation of FAs when at work, focusing on patterns, form and social context of meals. The research questions posed were how food and meals at work were characterised and perceived among the FAs, and what strategies were adopted to manage the food and meal situation. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen FAs working in Scandinavia. The results indicated that the organisation of work, time and place have a major influence on the meal situation at work, and how food and meals are perceived and managed by FAs. The work was defined as fragmented and inconsistent regarding time and place resulting in scattered meals and a more snack-based form of eating. The meal situation was characterised by irregularity as well as unpredictability. Eating took place when food was available and when there was enough time to eat, rather than being guided by hunger or social context. Various strategies such as eating in prevention, using emergency food, avoiding certain food and drinks or eating little or nothing at all were used to manage the unpredictability of the meal situation as well as the gap between organisational and individual times. The findings demonstrated the individual responsibility to solve the meal at work, e.g. to solve organisational times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2017,United Kingdom,Blood-injection-injury (B-I-I) specific phobia affects the outcome of hypoxic challenge testing,"<title>Blood-injection-injury (B-I-I) specific phobia affects the outcome of hypoxic challenge testing</title> <abstract>Background: Blood-injection-injury (B-I-I) phobia is capable of producing inaccurate hypoxic challenge testing results due to anxiety-induced hyperventilation. Case Report: A 69-yr-old woman with a history of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, restrictive spirometry, exercise desaturation requiring supplementary oxygen on mobilizing, reduced DLco, and B-I-I phobia was referred for hypoxic challenge testing (HCT) to assess in-flight oxygen requirements. HCT was performed by breathing a 15% F<inf>I</inf>o<inf>2</inf> gas mixture, simulating the available oxygen in ambient air onboard aircraft pressurized to an equivalent altitude of 8000 ft. S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> fell to a nadir value of 81% during HCT, although it rapidly increased to 89% during the first of two attempts at blood gas sampling. A resultant blood gas sample showed an acceptable Po<inf>2</inf> outside the criteria for recommending in-flight oxygen and a reduced Pco<inf>2</inf>. Entering the nadir S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> value into the Severinghaus equation gives an estimated arterial Po<inf>2</inf> of 6 kPa (45 mmHg), which was felt to be more representative of resting values during HCT, and in-flight oxygen was recommended. Discussion: While hyperventilation is an expected response to hypoxia, transient rises in S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> coinciding with threat of injury are likely to be attributable to emotional stress-induced hyperventilation, characteristic of B-I-I specific phobia and expected during the anticipation of exteroceptive threat, even in normal subjects. In summary, should excessive hyperventilation be detected during HCT and coincide with transient increases in S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf>, HCT should be repeated using S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> only as a guide to the level of hypoxemia, and S<inf>p</inf>o<inf>2</inf> maintained using supplementary oxygen in accordance with alternative methods described in guidelines. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Norfolk Island - United States,Running Memory for Clinical Handoffs: A Look at Active and Passive Processing,"<title>Running Memory for Clinical Handoffs: A Look at Active and Passive Processing</title> <abstract>Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of domain-relevant expertise on running memory and the ability to process handoffs of information. In addition, the role of active or passive processing was examined. Background: Currently, there is little research that addresses how individuals with different levels of expertise process information in running memory when the information is needed to perform a real-world task. Method: Three groups of participants differing in their level of clinical expertise (novice, intermediate, and expert) performed an abstract running memory span task and two tasks resembling real-world activities, a clinical handoff task and an air traffic control (ATC) handoff task. For all tasks, list length and the amount of information to be recalled were manipulated. Results: Regarding processing strategy, all participants used passive processing for the running memory span and ATC tasks. The novices also used passive processing for the clinical task. The experts, however, appeared to use more active processing, and the intermediates fell in between. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicated that individuals with clinical expertise and a developed mental model rely more on active processing of incoming information for the clinical task while individuals with little or no knowledge rely on passive processing. Application: The results have implications about how training should be developed to aid less experienced personnel identify what information should be included in a handoff and what should not. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2017,Israel,Cognitive evaluation of Israeli air force pilot cadets,"<title>Cognitive evaluation of Israeli air force pilot cadets</title> <abstract>OBJECTIVE: In aviation psychology, there is a constant need for the cognitive evaluation of pilots as part of operational fitness and safety criteria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with comparison between the performance of Israeli Air Force pilot cadets (N = 318) and U.S. Air Force pilot training candidates (N = 512) as assessed by a cognitive battery was undertaken. The data of the comparison group was collected from Callister, King, and Retzlaff, as published in 1996. RESULTS: In general, the means in the three components composing the battery-speed, accuracy, and throughput variables- indicated that the Israeli Air Force pilot cadets' scores were higher than those of the U.S. Air Force pilot candidates' scores in 50 of 53 variables. Nonsignificant differences were found in Accuracy of shifting attention-arrow color (SATAC), pathfinder-combined (PFC), and pathfinder-letter (PFL). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in performance between the two groups may be due to differences in population characteristics. However, these results need to be considered cautiously, as the groups were sampled at a sizeable time gap (1996 for the U.S. Air Force vs. 2013 for the Israeli Air Force), with each time period characterized by different cultural and technological influences. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Norway,"Subjective health complaints, work-related stress and self-efficacy in Norwegian aircrew","<title>Subjective health complaints, work-related stress and self-efficacy in Norwegian aircrew</title> <abstract>Background The European civilian aviation industry has undergone major changes in the last decade. Despite this, there is little knowledge about work-related stress and subjective health complaints (SHCs) affecting Norwegian aircrew. Aims To investigate the relationships between work-related stress, self-efficacy and SHCs in commercial aircrew in Norway and to explore differences between cockpit and cabin crew. Methods Aircrew members from the three major airlines operating from Norway completed an electronically distributed questionnaire. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between work-related stress, self-efficacy and SHCs. Results There was a 21% response rate. Among the 843 study subjects, tiredness, sleep problems, bloating, low back pain, headaches and neck pain were the most prevalent SHCs. Cabin crew reported significantly higher numbers, prevalences and mean values for all SHCs compared with cockpit crew (P < 0.05). In total, 20% reported high stress levels. High levels of work-related stress were significantly associated with all SHC factors in both groups. Self-efficacy partly moderated the relationship between stress and psychological complaints in both cockpit and cabin crew, and for musculoskeletal complaints in cockpit crew. The model explained 23 and 32% of the variance in psychological complaints for cockpit and cabin crew, respectively. Conclusions Commercial aircrew in Norway reported high numbers of SHCs, and high levels of work-related stress were associated with high numbers of SHC. More knowledge is needed on the physical, organizational and psychosocial stressors affecting cockpit and cabin crew in order to create a healthier work environment for these groups.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Understanding post-deployment reintegration concerns among en route care nurses: A mixed-methods approach,"<title>Understanding post-deployment reintegration concerns among en route care nurses: A mixed-methods approach</title> <abstract>The objective of this study was to better understand the post-deployment behavior health symptoms and readjustment/reintegration experienced by military nurses who provided en route care while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. Employing an exploratory, concurrent, mixed-methods design with an electronic survey consisting of several valid instruments and single, face-to-face interviews; data were gathered from 119 surveys and 22 interviews. Four qualitative themes aligned with the Post-Deployment Readjustment Inventory items. Findings from interviews support and illuminate the outcomes of the Post-Deployment Readjustment Inventory. Behavioral health usage was high in the quantitative sample. Nearly 74% (n = 88) of respondents indicating they had used Military Behavioral Health services following deployment. Statistically significant differences were noted among all subscales except Intimate Relationship Problems. Combined results indicated en route care nurses encountered difficulties when attempting to return to predeployment roles; behavioral health problems mirrored those of combat warriors. Interventions to assist post-deployment reintegration of en route care nurses should be conducted at the peer, leader, and health care provider levels. Embedding military mental health providers into en route care units is needed. It is imperative to gather lessons learned and identify ways to improve preparation for future conflicts and behavioral health of en route care nurses. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2017,Ireland - United Kingdom,Flying into Depression,"<title>Flying into Depression</title> <abstract>A growing body of evidence suggests long work hours adversely affect mental health across a variety of domains. Mental health issues have been found to negatively affect work performance. This finding was highlighted in the aviation industry by the 2015 Germanwings incident in which 150 people died. Further investigation into work hours and their associated factors (e.g., demographic characteristics and experiences of sleep and fatigue in the cockpit) contributing to mental health issues among pilots is warranted. A cross-sectional survey investigating attitudes and experiences of fatigue was developed and distributed to commercial airline pilots. Results found pilots who reported typically spending longer hours on duty per week were twice as likely to report feeling depressed or anxious. Pilots' experiences of job-related sleep disturbance and fatigue may explain why pilots who typically spend long hours on duty each week are more likely to report feeling depressed or anxious. © © 2016 The Author(s).</abstract>"
2017,"Iran, Islamic Republic of - Turkey",Perceived organizational support as the mediator of the relationships between high-performance work practices and counter-productive work behavior: Evidence from airline industry,"<title>Perceived organizational support as the mediator of the relationships between high-performance work practices and counter-productive work behavior: Evidence from airline industry</title> <abstract>In light of Signaling theory, this study investigates the mediating role of perceived organizational support (POS) in the relationship between high-performance work practices (HPWPs) and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Judgmental sample of flight attendants in Iran was used to asses this relationship. The results of multiple regression analysis indicate that empowerment, reward and promotion as indicators of HPWPs are negatively related to CWB. Further, the results support the mediating role of POS in this relationship. Specifically, results indicate that POS acts as the partial mediator in the relationships between empowerment, reward and CWB. Moreover, results support full mediating role of POS in the relationships between promotion and CWB. This study advances our understanding of organizational level antecedents of CWB and mediating role of POS as the social mechanism through which HPWPs predict employees’ behavioral outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2017,United States,Musings on Models and the Genius of Jens Rasmussen,"<title>Musings on Models and the Genius of Jens Rasmussen</title> <abstract>Two well-known Rasmussen models, the skill-rule knowledge (SRK) paradigm and the abstraction hierarchy, are compared to well-known models in both physics and psychology. Some of the latter are quantitative and make explicit predictions; some are qualitative, such as the Rasmussen models, being more useful for provoking thought about the relevant issues. Each of the Rasmussen models is evaluated with respect to six-attribute model taxonomy recently introduced by the author. The SRK model is shown to characterize modern automation as well as human behavior, with computer and physical devices exhibiting the a skill-based, rule-based and knowledge-based properties, and with monitoring and intermittent intervention by a human supervisor. A further suggestion is that the Rasmussen abstraction hierarchy could be applied not only to systems such as air traffic control but also to general situations of living. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2017,Japan - United States,US air force behavioral health optimization program: Team members' satisfaction and barriers to care,"<title>US air force behavioral health optimization program: Team members' satisfaction and barriers to care</title> <abstract>Background. Research has shown significant contribution of integrated behavioural health care; however, less is known about the perceptions of primary care providers towards behavioural health professionals. Objective. The current study examined barriers to care and satisfaction with integrated behavioural health care from the perspective of primary care team members. Design. This study utilized archival data from 42 treatment facilities as part of ongoing program evaluation of the Air Force Medical Service's Behavioral Health Optimization Program. Setting. This study was conducted in a large managed health care organization for active duty military and their families, with specific clinic settings that varied considerably in regards to geographic location, population diversity and size of patient empanelment. Study participants. De-identified archival data on 534 primary care team members were examined. Results. Team members at larger facilities rated access and acuity concerns as greater barriers than those from smaller facilities (t(533) = 2.57, P < 0.05). Primary Care Managers (PCMs) not only identified more barriers to integrated care (β = -0.07, P < 0.01) but also found services more helpful to the primary care team (t(362.52) = 1.97, P = 0.05). Barriers to care negatively impacted perceived helpfulness of integrated care services for patients (β = -0.12, P < 0.01) and team members, particularly among non-PCMs (β = -0.11, P < 0.01). Conclusions. Findings highlight the potential benefits of targeted training that differs in facilities of larger empanelment and is mindful of team members' individual roles in a Patient Centered Medical Home. In particular, although generally few barriers were perceived, given the impact these barriers have on perception of care, efforts should be made to decrease perceived barriers to integrated behavioural health care among non-PCM team members. © The Author 2016.

2017,United Kingdom,The impact of an implementation intention to improve mealtimes and reduce jet lag in long-haul cabin crew,"<title>The impact of an implementation intention to improve mealtimes and reduce jet lag in long-haul cabin crew</title> <abstract>Objective: Jet lag is common place amongst long-haul cabin crew. Timed food has been shown to reset the circadian rhythm in rodents. Implementation intentions have been used to change eating behaviour. Mealtimes could therefore be used as a countermeasure to reduce jet lag and improve alertness in long-haul cabin crew through forming an implementation intention to improve the regularity of meals on days off. Design: Sixty long-haul crew took part in a randomised controlled trial, with two conditions: forming an implementation intention to eat regular meals on days off vs. no implementation intention. Pre-intervention measurements were taken at baseline (before a long-haul trip) and post-intervention measures were taken on the first and second days off post-trip. Main outcome measures: Subjective jet lag (unidimensional and multidimensional) and objective alertness (Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)). Results: Mixed ANOVA showed a significant condition x time interaction for unidimensional jet lag but not for multidimensional jet lag and objective alertness. In particular, the formation of an implementation intention to alter mealtimes resulted in a reduction of unidimensional jet lag. Conclusion: Implementation intentions can be used to alleviate jet lag in long-haul crew through promoting a change in mealtimes. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"

Methods: Study participants were sixty adults with normal audiometric thresholds divided into two groups matched for age and gender: study group (SG), comprising 30 air traffic controllers and control group (CG), composed of 30 other military and civil servants. All participants were asked a number of questions regarding their health, communication, and attention, and underwent the Speech-in-Noise Test (SIN) to assess their closure skills and the Synthetic Sentence Identification Test - Ipsilateral Competitive Message (SSI-ICM) in monotic listening to evaluate their figure-ground abilities. Data were compared using nonparametric statistical tests and logistic regression analysis. Results: More individuals in the SG reported fatigue and/or burnout and work-related stress and showed better performance than that of individuals in the CG for the figure-ground ability. Both groups performed similarly and satisfactorily in the other hearing tests. The odds ratio for participants belonging in the SG was 5.59 and 1.24 times regarding work-related stress and SSI-ICM (right ear), respectively. Conclusion: Results for the variables auditory closure, self-reported health, attention, and communication were similar in both groups. The SG presented significantly better performance in auditory figure-ground compared with that of the CG. Self-reported stress and right-ear SSI-ICM were significant predictors of individuals belonging to the SG.</abstract>"
2017,"Korea, Republic of",Organizational virtuousness perceptions and task crafting: The mediating roles of organizational identification and work engagement,"<title>Organizational virtuousness perceptions and task crafting: The mediating roles of organizational identification and work engagement</title> <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between employees’ perceptions of organizational virtuousness and task crafting, and to test the mediating roles of organizational identification and work engagement in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected questionnaires from 175 Korean flight attendants and conducted structural equation modeling analyses. Findings: Employees’ perceptions of organizational virtuousness were positively associated with task crafting. While organizational identification was not solely responsible for mediating this relationship, it intervened in the relationship between organizational virtuousness perceptions and task crafting by affecting work engagement. Research limitations/implications: While this study provides important insights into the roles of organizational virtuousness, organizational identification, and work engagement in promoting task crafting, the use of self-reported, cross-sectional data limits causal inferences between variables. Practical implications: Based on the present findings, managers can better understand the antecedents and mediating processes affecting employees’ task crafting. Originality/value: This study adds value to the positive organizational psychology literature by revealing crucial intermediary processes linking organizational virtuousness perceptions and task crafting, thus suggesting reciprocity and social identity-based motivation as potential underlying mechanisms of task crafting. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2017,China,Leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior: The mediating role of coworker trust,"<title>Leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior: The mediating role of coworker trust</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: To achieve high safety levels, mere compliance with safety regulations is not sufficient; employees must be proactive and demonstrate safety citizenship behaviors. Trust is considered as a mechanism for facilitating the effects of a leader on employee citizenship behaviors. Increasingly research has focused on the role of trust in a safety context; however, the role of coworker trust has been overlooked. OBJECTIVES: The mediating role of coworker trust in the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior is the focus of this field study. METHODS: Front-line employees from an air traffic control center and an airline maintenance department completed surveys measuring leader-member exchange, co-worker trust, and safety citizenship behavior. RESULTS: Structural Equation Modeling revealed affective and cognitive trust in coworkers is influenced by leader-member exchange. A trust-based mediation model where cognitive trust and affective trust mediate the relationship between the leader-member exchange and safety citizenship behavior emerged. CONCLUSION: Results of this study add to our understanding of the relationship between leader-member exchange and safety behavior. The effect of co-worker trust and the extent to which employees participate in workplace safety practice were identified as critical factors. The findings show that managers need to focus on developing cognitive and affective coworker trust to improve safety citizenship behaviors. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.</abstract>"
2017,United Kingdom,Intergenerational conflict at US airlines: an unresolved Oedipal Complex?,"<title>Intergenerational conflict at US airlines: an unresolved Oedipal Complex?</title> <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how, if at all, organizational dynamics changed at US airlines after an industry wide modification to mandatory retirement age regulations in 2007. Findings challenge assumptions that society, organizations, and employees will all unequivocally benefit from abolishing mandatory retirement by investigating the impact of age-related policy changes on US airline pilots. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 43 semi-structured interviews were conducted with captains and copilots from US airlines between September 2010 and July 2011. From this data set, two informant subgroups emerged: first, senior captains averaging 59 years of age; and second, junior pilots averaging 43.5 years of age. Findings: Findings revealed that both senior and junior pilots reported retirement age policy changes created an antagonistic environment, pitting employees against each other in competition over scarce resources. Research limitations/implications: Paper findings are based on empirical materials collected during an 11 month snapshot-in-time between September 2010 and July 2011 and interview data are based on a small subgroup of US airline pilots who self-selected to participate in the study. Therefore, findings are not unbiased and may not be generalizable across all airlines’ pilot workgroups. Practical implications: Considerable research has been conducted identifying the policy and practice changes that employers need to adopt to retain older workers. However, few studies consider the psychological impact of these age-related workplace changes on employees or the organizational psychodynamics they might trigger. Originality/value: This paper makes two main contributions. First, through use of the psychoanalytic construct of the Oedipus complex, the paper sheds light on some of the psychodynamic consequences of age-related policy changes. Second, it challenges assumptions about workforce aging and the underlying causes of intergenerational conflict, highlighting ways that policy changes intended to eradicate discrimination against older workers can result in age discrimination against younger employees. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2017,Netherlands,Risk factors for fatigue among airline pilots,"<title>Risk factors for fatigue among airline pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: The objective of this study is to determine risk factors for fatigue among airline pilots, taking into account person-, work-, health-, sleep-, and lifestyle-related characteristics. Methods: The study population consisted of 502 pilots who participated in the MORE Energy study. Included risk factors were either measured through an online questionnaire or provided by the company. The outcome of this study, fatigue, was assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and was defined as scoring more than 76 points on this questionnaire. The association of the risk factors with fatigue was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the participating pilots, 29.5 % scored more than 76 points on the CIS and were classified as being fatigued. The fully adjusted regression model showed that person-, work-, health-, and lifestyle-related characteristics were associated with fatigue. Pilots who were aged 31 to 40 (OR 3.36, 95 % CI 1.32–8.53) or 41 to 50 (OR 4.19, 95 % CI 1.40–12.47), an evening type (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.38–4.16), scored higher on work-life balance disturbance (OR 1.22, 95 % CI 1.10–1.36), scored higher on need for recovery (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01–1.04), scored lower on general health perception (OR 0.31, 95 % CI 0.20–0.47), were less physically active (OR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.66–0.89), and had a moderate alcohol consumption (OR 3.88, 95 % CI 1.21–12.43), were at higher risk for fatigue. Conclusions: Higher age, being an evening type, disturbance of the work-life balance, more need for recovery, a lower perceived health, less physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption were shown to be risk factors for fatigue. Further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the direction of the associations found and to evaluate the effects of possible countermeasures in airline pilots. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</abstract>"
2016,United States,Airplane pilot mental health and suicidal thoughts: a cross-sectional descriptive study via anonymous web-based survey,"<title>Airplane pilot mental health and suicidal thoughts: a cross-sectional descriptive study via anonymous web-based survey</title> <abstract>Background: The Germanwings Flight 9525 crash has brought the sensitive subject of airline pilot mental health to the forefront in aviation. Globally, 350 million people suffer from depression-a common mental disorder. This study provides further information on this important topic regarding mental health especially among female airline pilots. This is the first study to describe airline pilot mental health-with a focus on depression and suicidal thoughts-outside of the information derived from aircraft accident investigations, regulated health examinations, or identifiable self-reports, which are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline companies. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study via an anonymous web-based survey administered between April and December 2015. Pilots were recruited from unions, airline companies, and airports via convenience sampling. Data analysis included calculating absolute number and prevalence of health characteristics and depression scores. Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty seven (52.7%) of the 3485 surveyed pilots completed the survey, with 1866 (53.5%) completing at least half of the survey. 233 (12.6%) of 1848 airline pilots responding to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and 193 (13.5%) of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold-PHQ-9 total score ≥ 10. Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks. We found a significant trend in proportions of depression at higher levels of use of sleep-aid medication (trend test z = 6.74, p < 0.001) and among those experiencing sexual harassment (z = 3.18, p = 0.001) or verbal harassment (z = 6.13, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Hundreds of pilots currently flying are managing depressive symptoms perhaps without the possibility of treatment due to the fear of negative career impacts. This study found 233 (12.6%) airline pilots meeting depression threshold and 75 (4.1%) pilots reporting having suicidal thoughts. Although results have limited generalizability, there are a significant number of active pilots suffering from depressive symptoms. We recommend airline organizations increase support for preventative mental health treatment. Future research will evaluate additional risk factors of depression such as sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. © 2016 The Author(s)</abstract>"
2016,China,Application of LC-MS-based global metabolomic profiling methods to human mental fatigue,"<title>Application of LC-MS-based global metabolomic profiling methods to human mental fatigue</title> <abstract>Mental fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for work and a loss of capacity to respond to stimulation and is usually accompanied by a feeling of tiredness and drowsiness. Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers' urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively.

2016,"Taiwan, Province of China - United Kingdom",Pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target,"<title>Pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Attention plays a central role in cognitive processing; ineffective attention may induce accidents in flight operations. The objective of the current research was to examine military pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target. METHOD: In the current research, 37 mission-ready F-16 pilots participated. Subjects' eye movements were collected by a portable head-mounted eye-tracker during tactical training in a flight simulator. The scenarios of chasing a moving target (air-to-air) and a stationary target (air-to-surface) consist of three operational phases: searching, aiming, and lock-on to the targets. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated significant differences in pilots' percentage of fixation during the searching phase between air-to-air (M = 37.57, SD = 5.72) and air-to-surface (M = 33.54, SD = 4.68). Fixation duration can indicate pilots' sustained attention to the trajectory of a dynamic target during air combat maneuvers. Aiming at the stationary target resulted in larger pupil size (M = 27,105, SD = 6565), reflecting higher cognitive loading than aiming at the dynamic target (M = 23,864, SD = 8762). DISCUSSION: Pilots' visual behavior is not only closely related to attention distribution, but also significantly associated with task characteristics. Military pilots demonstrated various visual scan patterns for searching and aiming at different types of targets based on the research settings of a flight simulator. The findings will facilitate system designers' understanding of military pilots' cognitive processes during tactical operations. They will assist human-centered interface design to improve pilots' situational awareness. The application of an eye-tracking device integrated with a flight simulator is a feasible and cost-effective intervention to improve the efficiency and safety of tactical training. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,France,Neural and psychophysiological correlates of human performance under stress and high mental workload,"<title>Neural and psychophysiological correlates of human performance under stress and high mental workload</title> <abstract>In our anxiogenic and stressful world, the maintenance of an optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. It is particularly true in complex working environments (e.g. flight deck, air traffic control tower), where individuals have sometimes to cope with a high mental workload and stressful situations. Several models (i.e. processing efficiency theory, cognitive-energetical framework) have attempted to provide a conceptual basis on how human performance is modulated by high workload and stress/anxiety. These models predict that stress can reduce human cognitive efficiency, even in the absence of a visible impact on the task performance. Performance may be protected under stress thanks to compensatory effort, but only at the expense of a cognitive cost. Yet, the psychophysiological cost of this regulation remains unclear. We designed two experiments involving pupil diameter, cardiovascular and prefrontal oxygenation measurements. Participants performed the Toulouse N-back Task that intensively engaged both working memory and mental calculation processes under the threat (or not) of unpredictable aversive sounds. The results revealed that higher task difficulty (higher n level) degraded the performance and induced an increased tonic pupil diameter, heart rate and activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, and a decreased phasic pupil response and heart rate variability. Importantly, the condition of stress did not impact the performance, but at the expense of a psychophysiological cost as demonstrated by lower phasic pupil response, and greater heart rate and prefrontal activity. Prefrontal cortex seems to be a central region for mitigating the influence of stress because it subserves crucial functions (e.g. inhibition, working memory) that can promote the engagement of coping strategies. Overall, findings confirmed the psychophysiological cost of both mental effort and stress. Stress likely triggered increased motivation and the recruitment of additional cognitive resources that minimize its aversive effects on task performance (effectiveness), but these compensatory efforts consumed resources that caused a loss of cognitive efficiency (ratio between performance effectiveness and mental effort). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"
2016,Germany,Psychometric personality differences between candidates in astronaut selection,"<title>Psychometric personality differences between candidates in astronaut selection</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: This paper investigates personality traits as potential factors for success in an astronaut selection by comparing personality profiles of unsuccessful and successful astronaut candidates in different phases of the ESA selection procedure. It is further addressed whether personality traits could predict an overall assessment rating at the end of the selection. METHODS: In 2008/2009, ESA performed an astronaut selection with 902 candidates who were either psychologically recommended for mission training (N = 46) or failed in basic aptitude (N = 710) or Assessment Center and interview testing (N = 146). Candidates completed the Temperament Structure Scales (TSS) and the NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R). RESULTS: Those candidates who failed in basic aptitude testing showed higher levels of Neuroticism (M = 49.8) than the candidates who passed that phase (M = 45.4 and M = 41.6). Additionally, candidates who failed in basic testing had lower levels of Agreeableness (M = 132.9) than recommended candidates (M = 138.1). TSS scales for Achievement (r = 0.19) and Vitality (r = 0.18) showed a significant correlation with the overall assessment rating given by a panel board after a final interview. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that a personality profile similar to Helmreich's ""Right Stuff"" is beneficial in astronaut selection. Influences of test anxiety on performance are discussed. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,United States,"Autonomous, computer-based behavioral health countermeasure evaluation at HI-SEAS mars analog","<title>Autonomous, computer-based behavioral health countermeasure evaluation at HI-SEAS mars analog</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Living in an isolated, confined environment (ICE) can induce conflict, stress, and depression. Computer-based behavioral health countermeasures are appealing for training and treatment in ICEs because they provide confidentiality and do not require communication with the outside environment. We evaluated the Virtual Space Station (VSS), a suite of interactive computer-delivered psychological training and treatment programs, at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) III expedition. METHODS: Six subjects (3 male, 3 female) spent 8 mo in group-isolation and used the Conflict, Stress, and Depression modules in the VSS. Survey evaluations, data collected within the program, and postdeployment interviews were collected. RESULTS: This crew dealt with behavioral health issues common to ICEs. The VSS proved to be a valuable resource and was used both as intended, and in unanticipated ways, to help maintain behavioral health. The Conflict and Stress Modules were rated as highly acceptable (1.8 on a 7-point Likert scale). The crew identified a total of 13 stressors and worked on 9 problems through the VSS. Opinions about the modules were highly individualized. Crewmembers identified exercises in the VSS that were applicable and not applicable to their needs. Additional content to improve the program was identified. DISCUSSION: Autonomous, confidential training and treatment for behavioral health issues will need to be a critical component of long duration spaceflight travel. This work provides an evaluation of such a tool in a relevant ICE. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,Brazil,Perceptual-auditory and Acoustic Analysis of Air Traffic Controllers’ Voices Pre- and Postshift,"<title>Perceptual-auditory and Acoustic Analysis of Air Traffic Controllers’ Voices Pre- and Postshift</title> <abstract>Objective To characterize the vocal quality and acoustic parameters of voices of air traffic controllers (ATCs) without any vocal complaints before and after a shift. Method The voices of a group of 45 ATCs were recorded before and after a 2-hour shift, regardless of their operational position or number of previously worked shifts; both genders were included, participants had a mean age of 25 years, and they had a mean length of occupational experience of 4 years and 2 months. Each of these professionals was recorded phonating a sustained /a/ vowel and counting from 1 to 20, and the recordings were acoustically analyzed using the Praat software. A perceptual-auditory analysis of the recordings was then performed by three speech therapists specializing in voice, who evaluated the characteristics of each emission using a visual analog scale (VAS). The acoustic analysis was performed on the sustained /a/ vowel. The measures of intensity; frequency; maximum phonation time (MPT); and the first, second, third, and fourth formants were considered in this analysis. Results There were no significant differences between the random pre- and postshift samples, either in the acoustic or in the perceptual-auditory analysis. The perceptual-auditory analysis revealed that 44% (n = 20) of ATCs showed alterations in vocal quality during the sustained /a/ vowel emission, and this dysphonia was also observed in connected speech in 25% (n = 5) of this group. Conclusion Perceptual-auditory analysis of the /a/ vowel revealed that a high percentage of ATCs had vocal alterations (44%), even among a group of subjects without vocal complaints. © 2016 The Voice Foundation</abstract>"
2016,Sweden,Respiratory illness and allergy related to work and home environment among commercial pilots,"<title>Respiratory illness and allergy related to work and home environment among commercial pilots</title> <abstract>The aim was to study associations between work and home environment and prevalence and incidence of respiratory health and a history of atopy in a 3-y cohort of commercial pilots. A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors' diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39-53.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03-3.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09-12.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43-8.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27-7.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32-12.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43-19.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections. © 2016 Fu et al.

2016,Poland,"Risk profiling of airline pilots: Experience, temperamental traits and aggression","<title>Risk profiling of airline pilots: Experience, temperamental traits and aggression</title> <abstract>It has been assumed that the greater the number of flying hours, the better the pilot is at solving problems. The studies suggest, however, that this issue is more complex. What is important is not only a pilot's experience but also their personality traits such as temperament, aggression, and risk-taking tendencies, which all influence how the pilot reacts under stress. After examining 112 pilots of passenger planes, we found that individuals characterized by a high need for stimulation seek situations, consciously or not, of excessive or unnecessary risk to achieve the right level of stimulation. In terms of their psychological characteristics, the study also revealed that some pilots are less predisposed to be airline pilots. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

2016,United States,Compilation of cognitive and personality norms for military aviators,"<title>Compilation of cognitive and personality norms for military aviators</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The assessment of individuals on abilities or other characteristics is based on comparison to a representative sample. General population norms provide an appropriate reference group when the distribution of scores in the sample can be expected to be similar to those for the general population (e.g., comparing high school students at a particular school to national high school norms on a college entrance test). Specialized norms are needed, however, when subsets of the population differ from the population at large. Military pilot trainees represent a special population; they are highly screened on cognitive ability and other characteristics thought to be related to job performance. Other characteristics (e.g., personality) are thought to be ""self-selected,"" resulting in distinctive profiles. Normative tables were developed for U.S. Air Force pilot trainees for two widely used tests, the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery-II (MAB-II) and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). METHODS: The MAB-II and NEO PI-R were administered to large samples of USAF cadets, ROTC students, and officers selected for pilot training. RESULTS: The mean MAB-II full-scale IQ was about 1.5 SD above the adult population norm and was much less variable, supporting the need for specialized norms. Tables showing the percentile equivalents are provided for use by clinicians. DISCUSSION: Use of these tables, in addition to, or in lieu of, commercially published norms, will prove helpful when clinical psychologists perform assessments on pilots; in particular when evaluating them for return-to-duty status following a disqualifying condition that may have affected cognitive functioning or emotional stability. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,Portugal - United Kingdom,Sleep and fatigue differences in the two most common types of commercial flight operations,"<title>Sleep and fatigue differences in the two most common types of commercial flight operations</title> <abstract>Background: Sleep and fatigue management is one of the main challenges in airline operations scheduling. Our aim was to compare the differences regarding fatigue, sleep, and labor specificities between the two most common types of flight, short/medium haul (SM-H) and long haul (L-H), in a large sample of airline pilots. Methods: A self-report questionnaire was developed, composed of socio-economic and labor questions, and psychological assessment scales for fatigue and sleep. Associations of these variables and type of flight were tested. Results: Of the total sample of Portuguese airline pilots (N = 435), 313 (72%) were from SM-H and 122 (28%) were from L-H. For SM-H, the values obtained for sleep complaints were 34.2%, daytime sleepiness 61.6%, and fatigue 93.0%. For L-H, 36.9%, 53.3%, and 84.4%, respectively. Looking at labor variables, the differences between the two types of flights were evident, with SM-H pilots' having statistically significant higher mean values of duty and flight hours, numbers of sectors, and early mornings. Only the mean number of night periods was higher in L-H pilots. All values were reported for 28 consecutive scheduling days. Conclusion: Night periods and time-zone crossing may explain higher prevalence levels of sleep disturbances in L-H pilots. However, the values for daytime sleepiness were higher in SM-H pilots, which may be attributed to diminished sleep caused by a combination of frequent early starts and long duty periods. Taking into account the large differences between the two types of flights, different regulatory limits should be considered by aviation authorities. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,Finland - United Kingdom,"Fighter pilots' heart rate, heart rate variation and performance during an instrument flight rules proficiency test","<title>Fighter pilots' heart rate, heart rate variation and performance during an instrument flight rules proficiency test</title> <abstract>Increased task demand will increase the pilot mental workload (PMWL). When PMWL is increased, mental overload may occur resulting in degraded performance. During pilots' instrument flight rules (IFR) proficiency test, PMWL is typically not measured. Therefore, little is known about workload during the proficiency test and pilots' potential to cope with higher task demands than those experienced during the test. In this study, fighter pilots' performance and PMWL was measured during a real IFR proficiency test in an F/A-18 simulator. PMWL was measured using heart rate (HR) and heart rate variation (HRV). Performance was rated using Finnish Air Force's official rating scales. Results indicated that HR and HRV differentiate varying task demands in situations where variations in performance are insignificant. It was concluded that during a proficiency test, PMWL should be measured together with the task performance measurement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"

PM demands can also interfere with ongoing tasks (costs). We examined the extent to which PM errors and costs were reduced in simulated ATC by providing extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with extended practice, or by providing external aids combined with instructions that removed perceived memory requirements. Participants accepted/handed-off aircraft and detected conflicts. For the PM task, participants were required to substitute alternative actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft. In Experiment 1, when no aids were provided, PM errors and costs were not reduced by practice. When aids were provided, costs observed early in practice were eliminated with practice, but residual PM errors remained. Experiment 2 provided more limited practice with aids, but instructions that did not frame the PM task as a ""memory"" task led to high PM accuracy without costs. Attention-allocation policies that participants set based on expected PM demands were modified as individuals were increasingly exposed to reliable aids, or were given instructions that removed perceived memory requirements. These findings have implications for the design of aids for individuals who monitor multi-item dynamic displays. © 2016 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2016,"Taiwan, Province of China",Human risk factors associated with pilots in runway excursions,"<title>Human risk factors associated with pilots in runway excursions</title> <abstract>A breakdown analysis of civil aviation accidents worldwide indicates that the occurrence of runway excursions represents the largest portion among all aviation occurrence categories. This study examines the human risk factors associated with pilots in runway excursions, by applying a SHELLO model to categorize the human risk factors and to evaluate the importance based on the opinions of 145 airline pilots. This study integrates aviation management level expert opinions on relative weighting and improvement-achievability in order to develop four kinds of priority risk management strategies for airline pilots to reduce runway excursions. The empirical study based on experts’ evaluation suggests that the most important dimension is the liveware/pilot's core ability. From the perspective of front-line pilots, the most important risk factors are the environment, wet/containment runways, and weather issues like rain/thunderstorms. Finally, this study develops practical strategies for helping management authorities to improve major operational and managerial weaknesses so as to reduce the human risks related to runway excursions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2016,United States,Recurrence of neurological deficits in an F/A-18D pilot following loss of cabin pressure at altitude,"<title>Recurrence of neurological deficits in an F/A-18D pilot following loss of cabin pressure at altitude</title> <abstract>Introduction: Supersonic, high altitude aviation places its pilots and aircrew in complex environments, which may lead to injury that is not easily diagnosed or simply treated. Decompression illness (either venous or arterial) and environmental conditions (e.g., abnormal gases and pressure) are the most likely adverse effects aircrew often face. Though symptomatic aircrew personnel may occasionally require hyperbaric oxygen treatment, it is rare to require more than one treatment before returning to baseline function. Case Report: This challenging aviation case details the clinical course and discusses the salient physiological factors of an F/A-18D pilot who presented with neurological symptoms following loss of cabin pressure at altitude. Discussion: Most crucial to this discussion was the requirement for multiple hyperbaric oxygen treatments over several days due to recurrence of symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence during and after future flights cannot be estimated with accuracy. This case illustrates a degree of recurrences for neurological symptoms in aviation (hypobaric exposure to hyperbaric baseline environment) that has not previously been described. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

Emotion work means the requirement to display particular emotions as part of the job and includes surface acting where actual emotions differ from displayed emotions and deep acting where displayed and felt emotions are congruent. Participants were 147 flight attendants (31 men, 116 women; mean age=36.9 years, SD=7.5) employed by a major Saudi Arabian airline, who were either Saudi nationals or nationals of other Gulf Arab countries. Data were collected with questionnaires. Analysis was based on the General Linear Model and indicated that deep acting towards customers and towards coworkers was positively related to job satisfaction. On the other hand, the hypothesized negative relationship between surface acting and job satisfaction was not supported. Organizational trust moderated the relationship of emotion work with job satisfaction. The findings indicate the importance of considering emotion work in interactions with coworkers along with the influence of national culture in the relationships of emotion work with key variables. © The Author(s) 2016.</abstract>"

This study assessed quality of life, the sleep, and the health of 30 air traffic controllers employed at an international airport in Brazil. The objective was to identify health and quality of life concerns of these professionals. The results identified physical inactivity, overweight, excess body fat, low scores for physical and social relationships, and sleep deprivation for workers in all four workshifts.

2016,Italy,How life experience shapes cognitive control strategies: The case of air traffic control training,"<title>How life experience shapes cognitive control strategies: The case of air traffic control training</title> <abstract>Although human flexible behavior relies on cognitive control, it would be implausible to assume that there is only one, general mode of cognitive control strategy adopted by all individuals. For instance, different reliance on proactive versus reactive control strategies could explain inter-individual variability. In particular, specific life experiences, like a highly demanding training for future Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs), could modulate cognitive control functions. A group of ATC trainees and a matched group of university students were tested longitudinally on task-switching and Stroop paradigms that allowed us to measure indices of cognitive control. The results showed that the ATCs, with respect to the control group, had substantially smaller mixing costs during long cue-target intervals (CTI) and a reduced Stroop interference effect. However, this advantage was present also prior to the training phase. Being more capable in managing multiple task sets and less distracted by interfering events suggests a more efficient selection and maintenance of task relevant information as an inherent characteristic of the ATC group, associated with proactive control. Critically, the training that the ATCs underwent improved their accuracy in general and reduced response time switching costs during short CTIs only. These results indicate a training-induced change in reactive control, which is described as a transient process in charge of stimulus-driven task detection and resolution. This experience-based enhancement of reactive control strategy denotes how cognitive control and executive functions in general can be shaped by real-life training and underlines the importance of experience in explaining inter-individual variability in cognitive functioning. © 2016 Arbula et al.

2016,Australia,Using memory for prior aircraft events to detect conflicts under conditions of proactive air traffic control and with concurrent task requirements,"<title>Using memory for prior aircraft events to detect conflicts under conditions of proactive air traffic control and with concurrent task requirements</title> <abstract>In 2 experiments we examined the impact of memory for prior events on conflict detection in simulated air traffic control under conditions where individuals proactively controlled aircraft and completed concurrent tasks. Individuals were faster to detect conflicts that had repeatedly been presented during training (positive transfer). Bayesian statistics indicated strong evidence for the null hypothesis that conflict detection was not impaired for events that resembled an aircraft pair that had repeatedly come close to conflicting during training. This is likely because aircraft altitude (the feature manipulated between training and test) was attended to by participants when proactively controlling aircraft. In contrast, a minor change to the relative position of a repeated nonconflicting aircraft pair moderately impaired conflict detection (negative transfer). There was strong evidence for the null hypothesis that positive transfer was not impacted by dividing participant attention, which suggests that part of the information retrieved regarding prior aircraft events was perceptual (the new aircraft pair ""looked"" like a conflict based on familiarity). These findings extend the effects previously reported by Loft, Humphreys, and Neal (2004), answering the recent strong and unanimous calls across the psychological science discipline to formally establish the robustness and generality of previously published effects. © 2016 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2016,New Zealand,Estimating long-haul airline pilots' at-home baseline sleep duration,"<title>Estimating long-haul airline pilots' at-home baseline sleep duration</title> <abstract>Objective: Characterize the baseline sleep of long-haul airline pilots. Methods: Sleep of 332 pilots (median age = 51 years, range = 23-64 years) from 4 airlines was measured by actigraphy while at home and off-duty and by retrospective estimate of the total amount of nighttime sleep usually obtained at home. Results: Mean actigraphic sleep per 24 hours during baseline periods was 6.8 hours (SD = 1.0 hour), 52 minutes shorter than mean self-reported usual nighttime sleep (7.6 hours, SD = 1.1 hours). Conclusions: Pilots' self-reported sleep duration was comparable to weekend sleep of men in general population samples, but their actigraphic baseline sleep was longer than objectively monitored sleep of other samples. Long-haul pilots routinely experience sleep restriction and circadian disruption across trips, both of which are implicated in increased health risks. We recommend that they be educated about the long-term importance for health of obtaining adequate sleep on off-duty days. © 2016 National Sleep Foundation.</abstract>"
2016,Germany,Flying the Needles,"<title>Flying the Needles</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of practice and training on fine-motor flying skills during a manual instrument landing system (ILS) approach. Background: There is an ongoing debate that manual flying skills of long-haul crews suffer from a lack of flight practice due to conducting only a few flights per month and the intensive use of automation. However, objective evidence is rare. Method: One hundred twenty-six randomly selected airline pilots had to perform a manual flight scenario with a raw data precision approach. Pilots were assigned to four equal groups according to their level of practice and training by fleet (short-haul, long-haul) and rank (first officer, captain). Results: Average ILS deviation scores differed significantly in relation to the group assignments. The strongest predictor variable was fleet, indicating degraded performance among long-haul pilots. Conclusion: Manual flying skills are subject to erosion due to a lack of practice on long-haul fleets: All results support the conclusion that recent flight practice is a significantly stronger predictor for fine-motor flying performance than the time period since flight school or even the total or type-specific flight experience. Application: Long-haul crews have to be supported in a timely manner by adequate training tailored to address manual skills or by operational provisions like mixed-fleet flying or more frequent transitions between short-haul and long-haul operation. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"

The aim of the present study was to examine whether EI would predict Assessment Center (AC) ratings of job-relevant competencies in a sample of applicants for the position of a flight attendant. Applicants' ability to regulate emotions predicted performance in group exercises. However, there were inconsistent effects of applicants' ability to understand emotions: Whereas the ability to understand emotions had a positive effect on performance in interview and role play, the effect on performance in group exercises was negative. We suppose that the effect depends on task type and conclude that tests of emotional abilities should be used judiciously in personnel selection procedures. © 2016 Herpertz et al.

Drawing on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and the literature on positive work environment, the indirect effects of perceived distributive and procedural justice on surface and deep acting through service employees' psychological capital were hypothesized. Using data from 263 flight attendants of the largest airline company in South Korea, the results indicated that perceived distributive and procedural justice were positively related to service employees' psychological capital, which, in turn, fostered deep acting but not surface acting. Deep acting was negatively related to emotional exhaustion, while surface acting showed a positive relationship. Emotional exhaustion, in turn, increased turnover intention. This study offers contributions to our understanding of positive psychological capital and implications for emotional labor in service management.

Now, with the reality of such missions lasting years, maintaining proper health of the flight crew is a high priority. While conditions such as nausea, bone loss, renal calculi and depression have been recognized, and approaches to medical and surgical care in space considered, the influence of the microbiota could be of added significance in maintaining astronaut health. While probiotics have long been part of the Russian cosmonaut diet, their use for specific health concerns of women has not been assessed. In this article, we explore the ways in which the microbiome may influence the health of female astronauts during long space flights, and present a rationale for the use of probiotics. © 2016 Future Medicine Ltd.</abstract>"
2016,France - New Zealand,Effects of mild hypoxia in aviation on mood and complex cognition,"<title>Effects of mild hypoxia in aviation on mood and complex cognition</title> <abstract>Thirty six volunteer air force personnel were sequentially exposed in a randomized balanced order in a hypobaric chamber to 30 min of baseline (sea level) and mild hypoxia induced by a specified altitude (sea level, 8000 ft and 12,000 ft), followed immediately by breathing 100% oxygen from an oro-nasal mask. Mood and complex cognition were assessed. Analysis of variance indicated that mood (fatigue and vigour) remained the same at 8000 ft but fatigue was increased (p = 0.001) and vigour reduced (p = 0.035) at 12,000 ft and was restored by supplementary oxygen. Complex cognition was not significantly altered by the test conditions. The results of this study do not support prior evidence that mild hypoxia equivalent to either 8000 or 12,000 ft, impairs complex cognition, but suggests that some aspects of mood may be affected at 12,000 ft and can be restored by breathing 100% oxygen. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2016,Australia - Germany,Threat of resource loss: The role of self-regulation in adaptive task performance,"<title>Threat of resource loss: The role of self-regulation in adaptive task performance</title> <abstract>Changes at work are often accompanied with the threat of, or actual, resource loss. Through an experiment, we investigated the detrimental effect of the threat of resource loss on adaptive task performance. Self-regulation (i.e., task focus and emotion control) was hypothesized to buffer the negative relationship between the threat of resource loss and adaptive task performance. Adaptation was conceptualized as relearning after a change in task execution rules. Threat of resource loss was manipulated for 100 participants undertaking an air traffic control task. Using discontinuous growth curve modeling, 2 kinds of adaptation-transition adaptation and reacquisition adaptation-were differentiated. The results showed that individuals who experienced the threat of resource loss had a stronger drop in performance (less transition adaptation) and a subsequent slower recovery (less reacquisition adaptation) compared with the control group who experienced no threat. Emotion control (but not task focus) moderated the relationship between the threat of resource loss and transition adaptation. In this respect, individuals who felt threatened but regulated their emotions performed better immediately after the task change (but not later on) compared with those individuals who felt threatened and did not regulate their emotions as well. However, later on, relearning (reacquisition adaptation) under the threat of resource loss was facilitated when individuals concentrated on the task at hand. © 2015 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"

2016,United States,"Humans and intelligent vehicles: The hope, the help, and the harm","<title>Humans and intelligent vehicles: The hope, the help, and the harm</title> <abstract>Intelligent vehicles offer hope for a world in which crashes are rare, congestion is reduced, carbon emissions are decreased, and mobility is extended to a wider population. As long as humans are in the loop, over a half century of research in human factors suggests that this hope is unlikely to become a reality unless careful attention is paid to human behavior and, conversely, the potential for harm is real if little attention is given to said behavior. Different challenges lie with each of the two middle levels of automation which are the primary focus of this article. With Level 2 automation (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; NHTSA), the driver is removed from always having to control the position and speed of the vehicle, but is still required to monitor both position and speed. Humans are notoriously bad at vigilance tasks, and can quickly lose situation awareness. Moreover, even if vigilant, the driver needs to interact with the vehicle. But voice-activated systems which let the driver continue to glance at the forward roadway are proving to be a potential source of cognitive distraction. With Level 3 automation (NHTSA), the driver is out of the loop most of the time, but will still need to interact with the vehicle. Critical skills can be lost over time. Unexpected transfers of control need to be considered. The surface transportation and aviation human factors communities have proposed ways to solve the problems that will inevitably arise, either through careful experimentation or extensions of existing research.</abstract>"
2016,Portugal,Physiological Factors Analysis in Unpressurized Aircraft Cabins,"<title>Physiological Factors Analysis in Unpressurized Aircraft Cabins</title> <abstract>Amateur and sports flight is an activity with growing numbers worldwide. However, the main cause of flight incidents and accidents is increasingly pilot error, for a number of reasons. Fatigue, sleep issues and hypoxia, among many others, are some that can be avoided, or, at least, mitigated. This article describes the analysis of psychological and physiological parameters during flight in unpressurized aircraft cabins. It relates cerebral oximetry and heart rate with altitude, as well as with flight phase. The study of those parameters might give clues on which variations represent a warning sign to the pilot, thus preventing incidents and accidents due to human factors. Results show that both cerebral oximetry and heart rate change along the flight and altitude in the alert pilot. The impaired pilot might not reveal these variations and, if this is detected, he can be warned in time. © 2016 L. Patrao et al. 2016.</abstract>"
2016,United States,Designs and Algorithms to Map Eye Tracking Data with Dynamic Multielement Moving Objects,"<title>Designs and Algorithms to Map Eye Tracking Data with Dynamic Multielement Moving Objects</title> <abstract>Design concepts and algorithms were developed to address the eye tracking analysis issues that arise when (1) participants interrogate dynamic multielement objects that can overlap on the display and (2) visual angle error of the eye trackers is incapable of providing exact eye fixation coordinates. These issues were addressed by (1) developing dynamic areas of interests (AOIs) in the form of either convex or rectangular shapes to represent the moving and shape-changing multielement objects, (2) introducing the concept of AOI gap tolerance (AGT) that controls the size of the AOIs to address the overlapping and visual angle error issues, and (3) finding a near optimal AGT value. The approach was tested in the context of air traffic control (ATC) operations where air traffic controller specialists (ATCSs) interrogated multiple moving aircraft on a radar display to detect and control the aircraft for the purpose of maintaining safe and expeditious air transportation. In addition, we show how eye tracking analysis results can differ based on how we define dynamic AOIs to determine eye fixations on moving objects. The results serve as a framework to more accurately analyze eye tracking data and to better support the analysis of human performance. © 2016 Ziho Kang et al.</abstract>"
2015,France,Cognitive workload and psychophysiological parameters during multitask activity in helicopter pilots,"<title>Cognitive workload and psychophysiological parameters during multitask activity in helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Helicopter pilots are involved in a complex multitask activity, implying overuse of cognitive resources, which may result in piloting task impairment or in decision-making failure. Studies usually investigate this phenomenon in well-controlled, poorly ecological situations by focusing on the correlation between physiological values and either cognitive workload or emotional state. This study aimed at jointly exploring workload induced by a realistic simulated helicopter flight mission and emotional state, as well as physiological markers. Method: The experiment took place in the helicopter full flight dynamic simulator. Six participants had to fly on two missions. Workload level, skin conductance, RMS-EMG, and emotional state were assessed. Results: Joint analysis of psychological and physiological parameters associated with workload estimation revealed particular dynamics in each of three profiles. 1) Expert pilots showed a slight increase of measured physiological parameters associated with the increase in difficulty level. Workload estimates never reached the highest level and the emotional state for this profile only referred to positive emotions with low emotional intensity. 2) Non-Expert pilots showed increasing physiological values as the perceived workload increased. However, their emotional state referred to either positive or negative emotions, with a greater variability in emotional intensity. 3) Intermediate pilots were similar to Expert pilots regarding emotional states and similar to Non-Expert pilots regarding physiological patterns. Discussion: Overall, high interindividual variability of these results highlight the complex link between physiological and psychological parameters with workload, and question whether physiology alone could predict a pilot's inability to make the right decision at the right time. © 2015.

Both immediate and relational dimensions of activity exist, making possible learning by means of active imitation (not blind copying) and articulation in conscious awareness. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract>"
2015,United States,Development and validation of the Cognition test battery for spaceflight,"<title>Development and validation of the Cognition test battery for spaceflight</title> <abstract>Background: Sustained high-level cognitive performance is of paramount importance for the success of space missions, which involve environmental, physiological, and psychological stressors that may affect brain functions. Despite subjective symptom reports of cognitive fluctuations in spaceflight, the nature of neurobehavioral functioning in space has not been clarified. Methods: We developed a computerized cognitive test battery (Cognition) that has sensitivity to multiple cognitive domains and was specifically designed for the high-performing astronaut population. Cognition consists of 15 unique forms of 10 neuropsychological tests that cover a range of cognitive domains, including emotion processing, spatial orientation, and risk decision making. Cognition is based on tests known to engage specific brain regions as evidenced by functional neuroimaging. Here we describe the first normative and acute total sleep deprivation data on the Cognition test battery as well as several efforts underway to establish the validity, sensitivity, feasibility, and acceptability of Cognition. Results: Practice effects and test-retest variability differed substantially between the 10 Cognition tests, illustrating the importance of normative data that both reflect practice effects and differences in stimulus set difficulty in the population of interest. After one night without sleep, medium to large effect sizes were observed for 3 of the 10 tests addressing vigilant attention (Cohen's d = 1.00), cognitive throughput (d = 0.68), and abstract reasoning (d = 0.65). Conclusions: In addition to providing neuroimaging-based novel information on the effects of spaceflight on a range of cognitive functions, Cognition will facilitate comparing the effects of ground-based analogues to spaceflight, increase consistency across projects, and thus enable meta-analyses.</abstract>"

2015,China,Prevalence and associated factors for temporomandibular disorders in Chinese civilian pilots,"<title>Prevalence and associated factors for temporomandibular disorders in Chinese civilian pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: Piloting is a special profession with prolonged stress, which could induce the occurrence of TMD. This sample is useful to reduce the effect of confounders in the analyses. Based on this, the present study aims to determine the prevalence and associated factors for TMD in civilian pilots of China. Methods: A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was carried out in 616 male subjects (aged 23–52 years). The questionnaire included general information, chewing preference (bilateral or unilateral), and Trait Anxiety section of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). The clinical examination contained TMD screening per research diagnostic criteria for TMD and diagnosis of sleep bruxism per American Academy of Sleep Medicine standards. The level of statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. Results: The program was conducted from June 2012 to April 2013, in which period, and the percentage of TMD in the samples we examined was 33.3 % (=205/616). Only high anxiety (OR 2.48; 95 % CI 1.25–4.90) and unilateral chewing preference (OR 12.67; 95 % CI 7.77–20.65) were the most significant associated factors with TMD. Also, salivary cortisol and the STAI-T score had a significant correlation (r = 0.47, P < 0.001). Conclusions: It was more reliable to study the associated factors on TMD with the exclusion of the possible confounding factors, and only unilateral chewing preference and psychological stress had a significant association with TMD. In addition, the salivary cortisol levels might assist to assess psychological stress in epidemiological research. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</abstract>"
2015,Brazil,"Quality of life, health, and sleep of air traffic controllers with different shift systems","<title>Quality of life, health, and sleep of air traffic controllers with different shift systems</title> <abstract>Background: Air traffic controllers (ATC) work shifts and their work schedules vary according to the characteristics of each airport. The human body adapts to shiftwork differently. These adjustments affect the health-disease process, predisposing ATC to risk conditions associated with sleep deprivation and lack of night sleep, which can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, anxiety, and obesity. This study investigated the characteristics of health, sleep, and quality of life of ATC exposed to 8-h alternate work shifts and 6-h rotational work shifts. Methods: The study was cross-sectional with convenience samples consisting of 84 ATC from two international airports in Brazil. We applied questionnaires to collect data about socioeconomic conditions, quality of life, sleep, and physical activity levels. We also collected health data regarding nutritional status, body composition, and blood pressure. We analyzed the differences between ATC from the two airports considering the variables of sleep, quality of life, and health. Results: Differences were found between the groups in terms of body fat percentage (30.7% and 27.8%), scores of overall quality of life (56.2 and 68), concentration (3.37 and 3.96), energy (3.12 and 3.62), and sleep time on working days (5:20 h and 6:15 h). Conclusion: ATC under 8-h alternate shifts showed lower scores for quality of life, higher body fat, and less sleep time on working days, which characterizes inadequate shiftwork for this population. © 2015.

2015,France - Germany - Russian Federation - United States,Wireless monitoring of changes in crew relations during long-duration mission simulation,"<title>Wireless monitoring of changes in crew relations during long-duration mission simulation</title> <abstract>Group structure and cohesion along with their changes over time play an important role in the success of missions where crew members spend prolonged periods of time under conditions of isolation and confinement. Therefore, an objective system for unobtrusive monitoring of crew cohesion and possible individual stress reactions is of high interest. For this purpose, an experimental wireless group structure (WLGS) monitoring system integrated into a mobile psychophysiological system was developed. In the presented study the WLGS module was evaluated separately in six male subjects (27-38 years old) participating in a 520-day simulated mission to Mars. Two days per week, each crew member wore a small sensor that registered the presence and distance of the sensors either worn by the other subjects or strategically placed throughout the isolation facility. The registration between two sensors was on average 91.0% in accordance. A correspondence of 95.7% with the survey video on day 475 confirmed external reliability. An integrated score of the ""crew relation time index"" was calculated and analyzed over time. Correlation analyses of a sociometric questionnaire (r =.35-.55, p<.05) and an ethological group approach (r =.45-.66, p < 05) provided initial evidence of the method's validity as a measure of cohesion when taking behavioral and activity patterns into account (e.g. only including activity phases in the afternoon). This confirms our assumption that the registered amount of time spent together during free time is associated with the intensity of personal relationships. © 2015 Johannes et al.</abstract>"
2015,China - United States,From trees to forest: relational complexity network and workload of air traffic controllers,"<title>From trees to forest: relational complexity network and workload of air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>In this paper, we propose a relational complexity (RC) network framework based on RC metric and network theory to model controllers' workload in conflict detection and resolution. We suggest that, at the sector level, air traffic showing a centralised network pattern can provide cognitive benefits in visual search and resolution decision which will in turn result in lower workload. We found that the network centralisation index can account for more variance in predicting perceived workload and task completion time in both a static conflict detection task (Study 1) and a dynamic one (Study 2) in addition to other aircraft-level and pair-level factors. This finding suggests that linear combination of aircraft-level or dyad-level information may not be adequate and the global-pattern-based index is necessary. Theoretical and practical implications of using this framework to improve future workload modelling and management are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"
2015,China,Developing a measurement for task complexity in flight,"<title>Developing a measurement for task complexity in flight</title> <abstract>Introduction: Task complexity is regarded as an essential metric that is related to a pilot's performance and workload. Normally, pilots follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during a flight. In this study, we developed a measurement named Task Complexity in Flight (TCIF) to represent the task complexity in the SOPs. Methods: The TCIF measurement combined four complexity components into one index: Actions logic complexity (ALC), actions size complexity (ASC), information control exchange complexity (ICEC), and control mode complexity (CMC).To verify the measurement, we calculated 11 tasks during the takeoffand landing phases from the SOPs, and invited 10 pilots to perform the same tasks in a flight simulator. After flight, the TCIF results were compared with two workload measure- ments: The Bedford scale and heart rate. Results: The results of TCIF and the 4 components of the 11 tasks were calculated. Further, the TCIF results showed a significant correlation with the Bedford scores (R = 0.851) and were also consistent with the difference in heart rate (R = 0.816). Therefore, with the increased TCIF results, both the Bedford scale and the difference in heart rate increased. Discussion: TCIF was proposed based on the flight operating conditions. Although additional studies of TCIF are necessary, the results of this study suggest this measurement could effectively indicate task complexity in flight, and could also be used to guide pilot training and task allocation on the flight deck. © 2015.

2015,France,A cognitive and virtual reality treatment program for the fear of flying,"<title>A cognitive and virtual reality treatment program for the fear of flying</title> <abstract>Background: Passenger air transport has considerably increased in the past 50 yr. It is estimated that between 7 and 40% of the population of industrialized countries is currently afraid of flying. Programs treating the fear of flying have been developed to meet this problem. This study measures the effectiveness of one of these programs by focusing on flight-related anxiety before the program and after the first flight following the intervention. Methods: There were 157 individuals recruited to participate in a 1-d intervention aiming at treating the fear of flying, and using both cognitive behavioral techniques and virtual reality. Anxiety was measured with the Flight Anxiety Situations (FAS) and the Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires. Results: Statistical analyses were conducted on 145 subjects (69.7% female, ages from 14 to 64) after the exclusion of individuals with missing data. The results showed a decrease in flight-related anxiety for each subscale of the two questionnaires: The somatic (d = 2.44) and cognitive anxiety (d = 1.47) subscales of the FAM, and the general flight anxiety (d = 3.20), the anticipatory flight anxiety (d = 1.74), and the in-flight anxiety (d = 1.04) subscales of the FAS. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the treatment program using both cognitive behavioral techniques and virtual reality strategies for fear of flying reduced flight-related anxiety in the subjects in our study. Our results show that subjects demonstrated lower anxiety levels after the first flight following the program than before the intervention. © 2015.

2015,Hong Kong - United Kingdom,Individual reactions to stress predict performance during a critical aviation incident,"<title>Individual reactions to stress predict performance during a critical aviation incident</title> <abstract>Background: Understanding the influence of stress on human performance is of theoretical and practical importance. An individual's reaction to stress predicts their subsequent performance; with a “challenge” response to stress leading to better performance than a “threat” response. However, this contention has not been tested in truly stressful environments with highly skilled individuals. Furthermore, the effect of challenge and threat responses on attentional control during visuomotor tasks is poorly understood. Design: Thus, this study aimed to examine individual reactions to stress and their influence on attentional control, among a cohort of commercial pilots performing a stressful flight assessment. Methods: Sixteen pilots performed an “engine failure on take-off” scenario, in a high-fidelity flight simulator. Reactions to stress were indexed via self-report; performance was assessed subjectively (flight instructor assessment) and objectively (simulator metrics); gaze behavior data were captured using a mobile eye tracker, and measures of attentional control were subsequently calculated (search rate, stimulus driven attention, and entropy). Results: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that a threat response was associated with poorer performance and disrupted attentional control. Conclusion: The findings add to previous research showing that individual reactions to stress influence performance and shed light on the processes through which stress influences performance. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"
2015,Austria - Czechia - Russian Federation - Sweden,Radiation environment at aviation altitudes and in space,"<title>Radiation environment at aviation altitudes and in space</title> <abstract>On the Earth, protection from cosmic radiation is provided by the magnetosphere and the atmosphere, but the radiation exposure increases with increasing altitude. Aircrew and especially space crew members are therefore exposed to an increased level of ionising radiation. Dosimetry onboard aircraft and spacecraft is however complicated by the presence of neutrons and high linear energy transfer particles. Film and thermoluminescent dosimeters, routinely used for ground-based personnel, do not reliably cover the range of particle types and energies found in cosmic radiation. Further, the radiation field onboard aircraft and spacecraft is not constant; its intensity and composition change mainly with altitude, geomagnetic position and solar activity (marginally also with the aircraft/spacecraft type, number of people aboard, amount of fuel etc.). The European Union Council directive 96/29/Euroatom of 1996 specifies that aircrews that could receive dose of > 1 mSv y-1 must be evaluated. The dose evaluation is routinely performed by computer programs, e.g. CARI-6, EPCARD, SIEVERT, PCAire, JISCARD and AVIDOS. Such calculations should however be carefully verified and validated. Measurements of the radiation field in aircraft are thus of a great importance. A promising option is the long-term deployment of active detectors, e.g. silicon spectrometer Liulin, TEPC Hawk and pixel detector Timepix. Outside the Earth's protective atmosphere and magnetosphere, the environment is much harsher than at aviation altitudes. In addition to the exposure to high energetic ionising cosmic radiation, there are microgravity, lack of atmosphere, psychological and psychosocial components etc. The milieu is therefore very unfriendly for any living organism. In case of solar flares, exposures of spacecraft crews may even be lethal. In this paper, long-term measurements of the radiation environment onboard Czech aircraft performed with the Liulin since 2001, as well as measurements and simulations of dose rates on and outside the International Space Station were presented. The measured and simulated results are discussed in the context of health impact. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2015,Poland,Preliminary results of the LF/HF ratio as an indicator for estimating difficulty level of flight tasks,"<title>Preliminary results of the LF/HF ratio as an indicator for estimating difficulty level of flight tasks</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The main aim of this study was to differentiate the magnitude of a pilot's heart rate variability (HRV) when performing assisted and unassisted flights, as well as simple and complex flight tasks. METHODS: Cardiac monitoring in flights was carried out using a compact, mobile ECG recorder. A frequency analysis of the heart rate (HR) signal was performed to determine the ratio of low-frequency spectral power (LF) to high-frequency spectral power (HF). RESULTS: The LF/HF ratio observed in the zone (M = 1.047, SD = 0.059) was significantly different than the LF/HF calculated preflight (M = 0.877, SD = 0.043) and postflight (M = 0.793, SD = 0.037). There was no main effect of the flight type (unassisted zone flight vs. zone flight with an instructor) on the LF/HF parameter. However, greater psychophysiological load of a pilot was observed in the training zone flights when compared to simple circle flights (main effect of the flight type). CONCLUSIONS: As the LF/HF ratio turned out to be significantly higher in the zone than pre- and postflight, this parameter can be useful for predicting the risk of excessive stress and arousal of pilots during flights. Based on the LF/HF ratio we can also estimate difficulty level of flight tasks, because our research has shown higher values of this parameter in the training zone flights than in simple circle flights. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

In a randomized crossover design, 10 physically active males completed a simulated 5-h domestic flight (DOM), 24-h simulated international travel (INT), and a control trial (CON). The mild hypoxia, seating arrangements, and activity levels typically encountered during air travel were simulated in a normobaric, hypoxic altitude room. Physical performance was assessed in the afternoon of the day before (D-1 PM) and in the morning (D+1 AM) and afternoon (D+1 PM) of the day following each trial. Mood states and physiological and perceptual responses to exercise were also examined at these time points, while sleep quantity and quality were monitored throughout each condition. Sleep quantity and quality were significantly reduced during INT compared with CON and DOM (P<0.01). Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 1 test performance was significantly reduced at D+1 PM following INT compared with CON and DOM (P<0.01), where performance remained unchanged (P>0.05). Compared with baseline, physiological and perceptual responses to exercise, and mood states were exacerbated following the INT trial (P<0.05). Attenuated intermittent-sprint performance following simulated international air travel may be due to sleep disruption during travel and the subsequent exacerbated physiological and perceptual markers of fatigue. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Background: HAI is an important characteristic of many modern work situations. Of course, the cognitive subsystems are not immediately apparent by observing a functioning system, but correlations between variables may reveal important relations. Method: The current report examined pilot judgments of 11 HAI dimensions (e.g., Workload, Task Management, Stress/Nervousness, Monitoring Automation, and Cross-Checking Automation) across 48 scenarios that required airline pilots to interact with automation on the flight deck. Results: We found three major clusters of the dimensions identifying subsystems on the flight deck: a workload subsystem, a management subsystem, and an awareness subsystem. Discussion: Relationships characterized by simple correlations cohered in ways that suggested underlying subsystems consistent with those that had previously been theorized. Application: Understanding the relationship among dimensions affecting HAI is an important aspect in determining how a new piece of automation designed to affect one dimension will affect other dimensions as well.</abstract>"
2015,United States,Surgeons’ Attitudes Are Associated With Reoperation and Readmission Rates,"<title>Surgeons’ Attitudes Are Associated With Reoperation and Readmission Rates</title> <abstract>Background: Attitudes influence how people make decisions. In an effort to decrease pilot judgment-related accidents, the Federal Aviation Administration teaches new pilots about hazardous attitudes that are believed to be incompatible with safe flight: macho, impulsive, worry, resignation, self-confidence, and antiauthority. If these attitudes are hazardous for pilots and their passengers, they may also be incompatible with the reliable and safe delivery of surgical care. Questions/purposes: The purposes of this study were (1) to ascertain to what extent surgeons harbor hazardous attitudes; and (2) to determine their relationship, if any, to reoperation and readmission rates. Methods: We selected validated aviation psychology tools that are used to measure these attitudes in pilots. We converted the aviation scenarios to analogous situations for surgeons and invited all surgeons from one academic program to participate in this study. A total of 41 surgeons were eligible to participate; 37 (90%) completed the attitude prevalence protocol and 31 (76%) had complete reoperation and readmission data for the correlation and regression analysis. Attending orthopaedic surgeons completed the Modified Surgeon Hazardous Attitude Scale as well as a series of additional instruments. Results: Levels of macho thought to be hazardous in pilots were present in nine (24%) surgeons. Similar, elevated levels of self-confidence were found in three (8%) surgeons. High levels of impulsivity were found in 5% (two surgeons) and high levels of antiauthority were found in 3% (one surgeon). Only one (3%) surgeon reported elevated levels of worry and no surgeon reported hazardous levels of resignation. Thirty percent (11 surgeons) of surgeons harbored at least one elevated attitude level. In a regression model, macho attitude levels predicted 19% of the variation in surgeons’ rate of readmissions and reoperations. Conclusions: High levels of hazardous attitudes may not be consistent with the routine delivery of safe surgical care in a teamwork setting where human factors and safe systems are the key to success. Further research is needed to determine if abnormally high levels of these hazardous attitudes impact patient care. Level of Evidence: Level II, prognostic study.

2015,Australia - France - United Kingdom,Safety sans frontières: An international safety culture model,"<title>Safety sans frontières: An international safety culture model</title> <abstract>The management of safety culture in international and culturally diverse organizations is a concern for many high-risk industries. Yet, research has primarily developed models of safety culture within Western countries, and there is a need to extend investigations of safety culture to global environments. We examined (i) whether safety culture can be reliably measured within a single industry operating across different cultural environments, and (ii) if there is an association between safety culture and national culture. The psychometric properties of a safety culture model developed for the air traffic management (ATM) industry were examined in 17 European countries from four culturally distinct regions of Europe (North, East, South, West). Participants were ATM operational staff (n = 5,176) and management staff (n = 1,230). Through employing multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, good psychometric properties of the model were established. This demonstrates, for the first time, that when safety culture models are tailored to a specific industry, they can operate consistently across national boundaries and occupational groups. Additionally, safety culture scores at both regional and national levels were associated with country-level data on Hofstede's five national culture dimensions (collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation). MANOVAs indicated safety culture to be most positive in Northern Europe, less so in Western and Eastern Europe, and least positive in Southern Europe. This indicates that national cultural traits may influence the development of organizational safety culture, with significant implications for safety culture theory and practice. © 2015 Society for Risk Analysis.</abstract>"
2015,,AsMA medical guidelines for air travel: Stresses of flight,"<title>AsMA medical guidelines for air travel: Stresses of flight</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Medical Guidelines for Airline Travel provide information that enables healthcare providers to properly advise patients who plan to travel by air. Modern commercial aircraft are very safe and, in most cases, reasonably comfortable. However, all flights, short or long haul, impose stresses on passengers. Preflight stresses include airport commotion on the ground such as carrying baggage, walking long distances, getting to the gate on time, and being delayed. In-flight stresses include acceleration, vibration (including turbulence), noise, lowered barometric pressure, variations of temperature and humidity, and fatigue among others. Healthy passengers normally tolerate these stresses quite well; however, there is the potential for passengers to become ill during or after the flight due to these stresses, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions and reduced physiological reserves. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2015,Germany,Eye-tracking measurements and their link to a normative model of monitoring behaviour,"<title>Eye-tracking measurements and their link to a normative model of monitoring behaviour</title> <abstract>Increasing automation necessitates operators monitoring appropriately (OMA) and raises the question of how to identify them in future selections. A normative model was developed providing criteria for the identification of OMA. According to this model, the monitoring process comprises distinct monitoring phases (orientation, anticipation, detection and recheck) in which attention should be focused on relevant areas. The current study tests the normative model on the basis of eye tracking. The eye-tracking data revealed increased concentration on relevant areas during the orientation and anticipation phase in comparison to the other phases. For the assessment of monitoring behaviour in the context of personnel selection, this implies that the anticipation and orientation phases should be considered separately as they appear to be more important in the context of monitoring than the other phases. Practitioner Summary: A normative model was developed for the assessment of monitoring behaviour. Using the eye-tracking method, this model was tested with applicants for an Air Traffic Controller training programme. The results are relevant for the future selection of human operators, who will have to monitor highly automated systems. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"
2015,New Zealand - United States,Effects of sleep/wake history and circadian phase on proposed pilot fatigue safety performance indicators,"<title>Effects of sleep/wake history and circadian phase on proposed pilot fatigue safety performance indicators</title> <abstract>Summary: The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and Samn-Perelli fatigue ratings, and psychomotor vigilance task performance are proposed as measures for monitoring commercial pilot fatigue. In laboratory studies, they are sensitive to sleep/wake history and circadian phase. The present analyses examined whether they reliably reflect sleep/wake history and circadian phase during transmeridian flight operations. Data were combined from four studies (237 pilots, 730 out-and-back flights between 13 city pairs, 1-3-day layovers). Sleep was monitored (wrist actigraphy, logbooks) before, during and after trips. On duty days, sleepiness, fatigue and mean response speed were measured pre-flight and at the top of the descent. Mixed-model analysis of variance examined associations between these measures and sleep/wake history, after controlling for operational factors. Circadian phase was approximated by local (domicile) time in the city where each trip began and ended. More sleep in the 24 h prior to duty was associated with lower pre-flight sleepiness and fatigue and faster response speed. Sleepiness and fatigue were greater before flights departing during the domicile night and early morning. At the top of the descent, pilots felt less sleepy and fatigued after more in-flight sleep and less time awake. Flights arriving in the early-mid-morning (domicile time) had greater sleepiness and fatigue and slower response speeds than flights arriving later. Subjective ratings showed expected associations with sleep/wake history and circadian phase. The response speed showed expected circadian variation but was not associated with sleep/wake history at the top of the descent. This may reflect moderate levels of fatigue at this time and/or atypically fast responses among pilots. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society.</abstract>"
2015,United Kingdom,Symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies in maritime pilotage,"<title>Symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies in maritime pilotage</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the symptoms of fatigue that maritime pilots experience during shift work. Moreover, the strategies these individuals use to cope with the onset of fatigue are also unknown. The current study explored the symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies experienced by maritime pilots when on-shift.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty maritime pilots were recruited via an advertisement in the national association's quarterly newsletter (Mage = 51.42; SD = 9.81). Participants responded to a modified version of the questionnaire used with aviation pilots that assessed overall fatigue, and the symptoms pilots associated with fatigue on duty. Methods pilots used to cope with fatigue before shift and when on the bridge were also assessed.RESULTS: There were significant effects for pilot vitality on 4 categories of fatigue: cognitive dysfunction; emotional disturbance; mean physical effects; and sleepiness. There were no significant effects for vitality on any of the self-reported coping strategy factors.CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that maritime pilots experience a variety of physical, behavioural, and cognitive fatigue symptoms when on shift. Some of these symptoms are similar to those reported by aviation pilots. However, unlike aviation pilots, maritime pilots reported utilising self-sufficient coping strategies to deal with the experience of fatigue.</abstract>"

In the process, she has come to identify numerous training principles that have been shown to promote the acquisition, retention, and transfer of knowledge and skills in laboratory studies. The goal of this article is to translate some of the training principles offered by Healy and her colleagues (Healy, Schneider, & Bourne, 2012) into real-world, practical training specifications for the particular context of pilot training at the airline level. The training approach described here suggests structuring all of airline pilot training as line-oriented flight training (LOFT), where the notion of ""line"" refers to the air-line drawn on a map between a departure airport and a destination airport. © 2015 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.</abstract>"

No studies have investigated military specific exposures that might increase this risk. Using a cross-sectional survey we evaluated sun exposure knowledge and practices of U.S. Air Force flight line workers whose duties may lead to increased melanoma risk. The specific aims of this study were to (1) describe the social demographic characteristics of maintenance personnel, (2) describe current sun blocking practices in maintenance personnel, (3) describe knowledge about sun exposure risks and benefits, and (4) identify factors influencing practices that increase the risk for developing melanoma. Our survey of 356 Air Force flight line personnel showed that 67% of their career required working in direct sunlight, 94.7% of personnel know that it is recommended to use sun blocking methods, yet the majority do not regularly use sun protective measures. Our results suggest that the increased incidence of melanoma in the U.S. Air Force may be due to the type or duration of ultraviolet exposure. © AMSUS - The society of Federal Health Professionals, 2015 printed in U.S.A.

We present a new method that tests the veracity of passenger accounts. In an in vivo double-blind randomized-control trial conducted in international airports, security agents detected 66% of deceptive passengers using the veracity test method compared with less than 5% using behavioral indicator recognition. As well as revealing advantages of veracity testing over behavioral indicator identification, the study provides the highest levels to date of deception detection in a realistic setting where the known base rate of deceptive individuals is low. © 2014 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2015,United States,Survivors perceptions of recovery following air medical transport accidents,"<title>Survivors perceptions of recovery following air medical transport accidents</title> <abstract>Objective: Air medical transport (AMT) teams play an essential role in the care of the critically ill and injured. Their work, however, is not without risk. Since the inception of the industry numerous AMT accidents have been reported. The objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of the post-accident sequelae for professionals who have survived AMT accidents. The hope is that this understanding will empower the industry to better support survivors and plan for the contingencies of post-accident recovery.Methods: Qualitative methods were used to explore the experience of flight crew members who have survived an AMT accident. ""Accident"" was defined using criteria established by the National Transportation Safety Board. Traditional focus group methodology explored the survivors' experiences following the accident.Results: Seven survivors participated in the focus group. Content analysis revealed themes in four major domains that described the experience of survivors: Physical, Psychological, Relational and Financial. Across the themes survivors reported that industry and company response varied greatly, ranging from generous support, understanding and action to make safety improvements, to little response or action and lack of attention to survivor needs.Conclusion: Planning for AMT post-accident response was identified to be lacking in scope and quality. More focused efforts are needed to assist and support the survivors as they regain both their personal and professional lives following the accident. This planning should include all stakeholders in safe transport; the individual crewmember, air medical transport companies, and the industry at large.</abstract>"

The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions. While PPP was poorer in the SART than in the TVF, that result could be accounted for by a loss of motor control rather than a lack of mindfulness. Identical high levels of workload were generated by the TVF and SART tasks, and observers in both conditions showed similar dynamic scanning of the visual scene.Conclusion: The data indicate that the SART is not an engine of mindlessness.Application: The results challenge the widespread use of the SART to support a model in which mindlessness is considered to be the principal root of detection failures in vigilance.</abstract>"
2014,United States,The retention of manual flying skills in the automated cockpit,"<title>The retention of manual flying skills in the automated cockpit</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to understand how the prolonged use of cockpit automation is affecting pilots' manual flying skills.Background: There is an ongoing concern about a potential deterioration of manual flying skills among pilots who assume a supervisory role while cockpit automation systems carry out tasks that were once performed by human pilots.Method: We asked 16 airline pilots to fly routine and nonroutine flight scenarios in a Boeing 747-400 simulator while we systematically varied the level of automation that they used, graded their performance, and probed them about what they were thinking about as they flew.Results: We found pilots' instrument scanning and manual control skills to be mostly intact, even when pilots reported that they were infrequently practiced. However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (e.g., tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.Conclusion: We found that while pilots' instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation.</abstract>"

2014,United States,Effects of sex and gender on adaptation to space: Musculoskeletal health,"<title>Effects of sex and gender on adaptation to space: Musculoskeletal health</title> <abstract>There is considerable variability among individuals in musculoskeletal response to long-duration spaceflight. The specific origin of the individual variability is unknown but is almost certainly influenced by the details of other mission conditions such as individual differences in exercise countermeasures, particularly intensity of exercise, dietary intake, medication use, stress, sleep, psychological profiles, and actual mission task demands. In addition to variations in mission conditions, genetic differences may account for some aspect of individual variability. Generally, this individual variability exceeds the variability between sexes that adds to the complexity of understanding sex differences alone.

It was developed in response to a recommendation from the 2011 National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, ""Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences for a New Era,"" which emphasized the need to fully understand sex and gender differences. In this article, our workgroup - consisting of expert scientists and clinicians from academia and the private sector - investigated and summarized the current body of published and unpublished human research performed to date related to sex- and gender-based differences in behavioral adaptations to human spaceflight. This review identifies sex-related differences in: (1) sleep, circadian rhythms, and neurobehavioral measures; (2) personality, group interactions, and work performance and satisfaction; and (3) stress and clinical disorders. Differences in these areas substantially impact the risks and optimal medical care required by space-faring women.

Female astronauts are more susceptible to orthostatic intolerance after space flight; the visual impairment intracranial pressure syndrome predominates slightly in males. Since spaceflight simulates vascular aging, sex-specific effects on vascular endothelium and thrombotic risk warrant examination as predisposing factors to atherosclerosis, important as the current cohort of astronauts ages. Currently, 20% of astronauts are women, and the recently selected astronaut recruits are 50% women. Thus there should be expectation that future research will reflect the composition of the overall population to determine potential benefits or risks. This should apply both to clinical studies and to basic science research. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.</abstract>"

Most research examining the cognitive mechanisms underlying prospective memory has used simple, static tasks, which may make it difficult to generalize results to work settings. I describe a body of research that has applied theory and methods from the basic prospective-memory and attention-capture literatures to simulations of air traffic control. These theories and methods can be used to anticipate many findings, such as the finding that prospective-memory demands incur performance costs in ongoing air traffic control tasks, and that prospective-memory error and costs to ongoing air traffic control tasks can be reduced by the use of spatial context or prospective-memory aids. Research in laboratory settings that simulates work contexts such as air traffic control can both establish the utility of psychological theory and produce application-relevant information. © The Author(s) 2014.</abstract>"
2014,Sweden,"Musculoskeletal symptoms and psychosocial work environment, among Swedish commercial pilots","<title>Musculoskeletal symptoms and psychosocial work environment, among Swedish commercial pilots</title> <abstract>Purpose: The associations between psychosocial work conditions and health in pilots are understudied, and therefore, the associations between the psychosocial work conditions and musculoskeletal problems among Swedish commercial pilots were investigated.Methods: In 2010, a self-administered questionnaire study was performed among pilots in one Swedish commercial airline: 354 pilots participated (61 %). Musculoskeletal symptoms and the psychosocial work conditions measured by the demand control social support model were investigated. Odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were expressed per change of one unit on the interquartile score scale.Results: Pilots on long-haul flights had less elbow symptoms (OR 0.34, 95 % CI 0.14–0.85), and women had more hand symptoms (OR 2.90, 95 % CI 1.11–7.52). There were associations between high work demands and symptoms from the neck (OR 2.04, 95 % CI 1.45–2.88), shoulders (OR 1.46, 95 % 1.05–2.03), elbows (OR 1.79, 95 % CI 1.10–2.90) and low back (OR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.02–1.96) in pilots. Low social support was associated with symptoms from the neck (OR 1.87, 95 % 1.35–2.58), shoulders (OR 1.56, 95 % CI 1.14–2.14) and low back (OR 1.63, 95 % CI 1.18–2.24). Low supervisor support was associated with neck (OR 1.67, 95 % CI 1.22–2.27), shoulders (OR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.02–1.87) and low back symptoms (OR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.09–2.01). The associations were mainly found among first officers.Conclusions: Musculoskeletal symptoms in pilots can be affected by poor psychosocial work conditions such as high demands and low social support, especially for first officers.

2014,United States,Four models of family interests,"<title>Four models of family interests</title> <abstract>In this article, I distinguish between 4 models for thinking about how to balance the interests of parents, families, and a sick child: (1) the oxygen mask model; (2) the wide interests model; (3) the family interests model; and (4) the direct model. The oxygen mask model - which takes its name from flight attendants' directives to parents to put on their own oxygen mask before putting on their child's - says that parents should consider their own interests only insofar as doing so is, ultimately, good for the sick child. The wide interests model suggests that in doing well by my child I am at the very same time doing well by myself. My interests can, and plausibly do, encompass the interests of others; they are, to that extent, wide. There is, then, no sharp separation between the interests of the sick child and the interests of other family members. In the family interests model, families themselves are seen as having interests that are neither identical to the sum, nor a simple function, of the interests of individual family members. The family has goals, values, and aspirations that are essentially corporate rather than individual. According to this model, these family interests can explain why sacrifices can sometimes be demanded of some family members for the sake of others in a medical setting. Finally, the direct model takes a simpler view of family members' interests; it claims that these interests matter simply on their own and should be taken into account in making treatment decisions for a sick child. This model openly considers the competing interests that parents and other family members often have when caring for a sick child, and advocates for weighing those interests when making decisions for and about the sick child. While there is room for all four models at the bedside, I argue that the direct model should be highlighted in clinical decision-making. © © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</abstract>"

However, it does not account for the time taken to make a decision, nor why response bias might change over time. Sequential sampling models provide a way of accounting for speed-accuracy trade-offs and response bias shifts. In this study, we test the validity of a sequential sampling model of conflict detection in a simulated air traffic control task by assessing whether two of its key parameters respond to experimental manipulations in a theoretically consistent way. Through experimental instructions, we manipulated participants' response bias and the relative speed or accuracy of their responses. The sequential sampling model was able to replicate the trends in the conflict responses as well as response time across all conditions. Consistent with our predictions, manipulating response bias was associated primarily with changes in the model's Criterion parameter, whereas manipulating speed- accuracy instructions was associated with changes in the Threshold parameter. The success of the model in replicating the human data suggests we can use the parameters of the model to gain an insight into the underlying response bias and speed-accuracy preferences common to dynamic decision-making tasks. © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"

This investigation was a longitudinal study of U.S. Air Force security forces assigned to a year-long high-threat ground mission in Iraq to determine the degree to which airmen's emotional and behavioral health and committed relationships were adversely impacted by an extended deployment to a warzone. Participants were a cohort of 164 security forces airmen tasked to a 365-day deployment to train Iraqi police. Airmen completed study measures both prior to and 6-9 months following deployment. Rates of deterioration in individual and interpersonal adjustment were both significant and medium to large in magnitude of effect, d = 0.43 to 0.90. Results suggest that the negative effects of deployment are related to levels of traumatic experiences and do not spontaneously remit within the first 6-9 months following return from deployment-particularly among those service members having relatively lower levels of social support.

Air Force personnel with accession records who were disability retired between 2002 and 2011 were included as cases. Controls were matched by accession year from the population of accessions not evaluated for disability at a ratio of 2:1. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the odds of disability retirement.RESULTS: Women and those aged 25 or older were significantly more likely to be disability retired. Deployment was also associated with disability retirement but was significantly protective. Among women, the odds of disability retirement did not vary when stratified by deployment history. Preexisting medical conditions were not associated with disability retirement. Psychiatric conditions were the most common condition type among those who were disability retired in the Air Force.CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to assess risk factors for psychiatric disability, the most common disability retired condition, as well as to describe the role of occupation and combat exposure in disability retirement from the Air Force.

We used questionnaires and the Rasch model to measure aircrew personnel's ability to adapt to centrifuge training. The measurement items were ranked by 611 military aircrew personnel. Analytical results indicated that the majority of the stress perceived by aircrew personnel resulted from the lightproof cockpit without outer reference. This study prioritized the equipment requiring updating as the lightproof cockpit design, the dim lighting of the cockpit, and the pedal design. A significant difference was found between pilot and non-pilot subjects' stress from the pedal design; and considerable association was discernible between the seat angle design and flight hours accrued. The study results provide aviators, astronauts, and air forces with reliable information as to which equipment items need to be urgently upgraded as their present physiological and psychological effects can affect the effectiveness of centrifuge training.</abstract>"

Background: Air traffic control is an example of work in which operators have to schedule their tasks as a partially predictable work flow emerges. To date, little attention has been paid to such on-the-fly scheduling situations. Method: We present a series of discrete-event models fit to conflict resolution decision data collected from experienced controllers operating in a highfidelity simulation. Results: Our simulations reveal air traffic controllers' scheduling decisions as examples of the partialorder planning approach of Hayes-Roth and Hayes- Roth. The most successful model uses opportunistic first-come-first-served scheduling to select tasks from a queue. Tasks with short deadlines are executed immediately. Tasks with long deadlines are evaluated to assess whether they need to be executed immediately or deferred. Conclusion: On-the-fly task scheduling is computationally tractable despite its surface complexity and understandable as an example of both the partial-order planning strategy and the dynamic-value approach to prioritization.

Methods: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin, C-peptide, leptin, cortisol, and NGF and BDNF plasma levels were monitored in six healthy nonsmoking male subjects taking part in a 105-d Mars mission simulation. Samples were collected from each subject before (0 wk), during (2.5 wk; 5 wk; 10 wk; 15 wk), and after confinement (+1 wk). Results: Confinement resulted in impaired glucometabolic parameters, since FPG increased during the first 5 wk (baseline: 85.2 ± 10.8 mg · dl-1; 2.5 wk: 98.4 ± 4.7 mg · dl-1; 5 wk: 92.5 ± 6.0 mg · dl-1) and insulin dropped at 2.5 wk (baseline: 14.4 ± 4.8 mU · L-1; 2.5 wk: 7.7 ± 2.1 mU · L-1), subsequently returning to baseline values. HOMA-IR paralleled plasma insulin, dropping to 1.8 ± 0.5 at 2.5 wk (baseline: 3.0 ± 1.2). At all time-points tested, plasma leptin levels were decreased (baseline: 4.4 ± 3.3 ng · dl-1; 2.5 wk: 1.6 ± 1.2 ng · dl-1; 5 wk: 1.3 ± 0.8 ng · dl-1; 10 wk: 1.5 ± 1.1 ng · dl-1; 15 wk:1.7 ± 0.8 ng · dl-1), whereas cortisol levels were increased (baseline: 10.8 ± 4.9 ng · dl-1; 2.5 wk: 16.8 ± 3.5 ng · dl-1; 5 wk: 18.1 ± 7.6 ng · dl-1; 10 wk: 18.1 ± 8.3 ng · dl-1; 15 wk:14.2 ± 4.4 ng · dl-1), resulting in a negative correlation between these hormones. BDNF levels increased only at 5 and 10 wk (baseline: 67.1 ± 36.0 pg · ml-1; 5 wk: 164 ± 54 pg · ml-1; and 10 wk: 110.2 ± 28.9 pg · ml-1).

Day 1 consisted of two +G<inf>z</inf> runs (peak = +3.5 G<inf>z</inf>) and two +G<inf>x</inf> runs (peak = +6.0 G<inf>x</inf>). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G<inf>x</inf> and +G<inf>z</inf>). Hemodynamic data were collected during the profiles. Subjects completed a retrospective self-report anxiety questionnaire. Medical monitors identified individuals exhibiting varying degrees of anxiousness during centrifuge exposure, medical histories of psychiatric disease, and other potential indicators of psychological intolerance of spaceflight. Results: The retrospective survey identified 18 individuals self-reporting anxiousness, commonly related to unfamiliarity with centrifuge acceleration and concerns regarding medical history. There were 12 individuals (5 men, 7 women, average age 46.2 yr) who were observed to have anxiety that interfered with their ability to complete training; of these, 4 reported anxiousness on their questionnaire and 9 ultimately completed the centrifuge profiles. Psychiatric history was not significantly associated with anxious symptoms. Discussion: Anxiety is likely to be a relevant and potentially disabling problem for commercial spaceflight participants; however, positive psychiatric history and self-reported symptoms did not predict anxiety during centrifuge performance. Symptoms of anxiousness can often be ameliorated through training and coaching. Even highly anxious individuals are likely capable of tolerating commercial spaceflight. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2014,Switzerland,"Speaking up in ad hoc multiteam systems: Individual-level effects of psychological safety, status, and leadership within and across teams","<title>Speaking up in ad hoc multiteam systems: Individual-level effects of psychological safety, status, and leadership within and across teams</title> <abstract>Speaking up in high-risk organizations plays a pivotal role in the mitigation of errors and can make the difference between life and death. To date, speaking up has been studied mostly within teams. However, many high-risk organizations rely on the effective collaboration across teams in ad hoc multiteam systems (MTS). This study widens the scope of research from teams to MTS and empirically compares the mechanisms involved in speaking up within versus across teams in ad hoc MTS-aircrews. In a sample of 1490 aircrew members of a European airline, we found that crewmembers' individual level perceptions of psychological safety mediated both the relationship between status and speaking up and between perceived leader inclusiveness and speaking up within teams. Across teams, however, psychological safety and leader inclusiveness-as perceived by pursers in their role as boundary spanners-showed no effect. Instead, it was pursers' within-team perceptions of psychological safety that mediated between status and speaking up across teams. Teams in ad hoc MTS may thus serve as safe harbours supporting their members also in interactions across team boundaries. Implications of findings for research on MTS and practical recommendations to improve speaking up within and across teams in ad hoc MTS are discussed. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"
2014,Poland,Back pain and its consequences among Polish Air Force pilots flying high performance aircraft,"<title>Back pain and its consequences among Polish Air Force pilots flying high performance aircraft</title> <abstract>Objectives: Back pain in Air Force fast jet pilots has been studied by several air forces and found to be relatively common. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and degree of the pain intensity in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, subjective risk factors and their effect on the pilots' performance while flying high maneuver aircrafts and the consequences for cognitive deficiencies. Material and Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective, anonymous questionnaire survey, collecting data on the age, aircraft type, flying hours, pain characteristics, physical activity, etc. The study was participated by 94 pilots aged 28-45 years (mean age: 35.9±3.3 years), actively flying fast jet aircrafts Su-22, Mig-29 and F-16. The estimates regarding the level of the subjective back pain were established using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: The values of the Cochran and Cox T-test for heterogeneous variances are as follows: for the total number of flying hours: F = 2.53, p = 0.0145, for the pilot's age: F = 3.15, p = 0.003, and for the BMI factor F = 2.73, p = 0.008. Conclusions: Our questionnaire survey showed a significant problem regarding spinal conditions in high performance aircraft pilots. The determination of the risk factors may lead to solving this problem and help eliminate the effect of the unfavorable environment on piloting jet aircrafts. Experiencing back pain during the flight might influence the mission performance and flight safety. The costs of pilots education are enormous and inability to fly, or even disability, leads to considerable economic loss. More research on specific prevention strategies is warranted in order to improve the in-flight working environment of fighter pilots. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.</abstract>"

2014,Canada - France,Failure to detect critical auditory alerts in the cockpit: Evidence for inattentional deafness,"<title>Failure to detect critical auditory alerts in the cockpit: Evidence for inattentional deafness</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether inattentional deafness to critical alarms would be observed in a simulated cockpit. Background: The inability of pilots to detect unexpected changes in their auditory environment (e.g., alarms) is a major safety problem in aeronautics. In aviation, the lack of response to alarms is usually not attributed to attentional limitations, but rather to pilots choosing to ignore such warnings due to decision biases, hearing issues, or conscious risk taking. Method: Twenty-eight general aviation pilots performed two landings in a flight simulator. In one scenario an auditory alert was triggered alone, whereas in the other the auditory alert occurred while the pilots dealt with a critical windshear. Results: In the windshear scenario, 11 pilots (39.3%) did not report or react appropriately to the alarm whereas all the pilots perceived the auditory warning in the no-windshear scenario. Also, of those pilots who were first exposed to the no-windshear scenario and detected the alarm, only three suffered from inattentional deafness in the subsequent windshear scenario. Conclusion: These findings establish inattentional deafness as a cognitive phenomenon that is critical for air safety. Pre-exposure to a critical event triggering an auditory alarm can enhance alarm detection when a similar event is encountered subsequently. Application: Case-based learning is a solution to mitigate auditory alarm misperception. © 2013, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2014,Germany - United States,Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) in complex systems: Cultural adaptation and safety impacts in healthcare,"<title>Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) in complex systems: Cultural adaptation and safety impacts in healthcare</title> <abstract>In complex systems, such as hospitals or air traffic control operations, critical incidents (CIs) are unavoidable. These incidents can not only become critical for victims but also for professionals working at the ""sharp end"" who may have to deal with critical incident stress (CIS) reactions that may be severe and impede emotional, physical, cognitive and social functioning. These CIS reactions may occur not only under exceptional conditions but also during every-day work and become an important safety issue. In contrast to air traffic management (ATM) operations in Europe, which have readily adopted critical incident stress management (CISM), most hospitals have not yet implemented comprehensive peer support programs. This survey was conducted in 2010 at the only European general hospital setting which implemented CISM program since 2004. The aim of the article is to describe possible contribution of CISM in hospital settings framed from the perspective of organizational safety and individual health for healthcare professionals. Findings affirm that daily work related incidents also can become critical for healthcare professionals. Program efficiency appears to be influenced by the professional culture, as well as organizational structure and policies. Overall, findings demonstrate that the adaptation of the CISM program in general hospitals takes time but, once established, it may serve as a mechanism for changing professional culture, thereby permitting the framing of even small incidents or near misses as an opportunity to provide valuable feedback to the system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract>"
2014,Canada - United States,Supervisory-level interruption recovery in time-critical control tasks,"<title>Supervisory-level interruption recovery in time-critical control tasks</title> <abstract>This paper investigates the effectiveness of providing interruption recovery assistance in the form of an interactive visual timeline of historical events on a peripheral display in support of team supervision in time-critical settings. As interruptions can have detrimental effects on task performance, particularly in time-critical work environments, there is growing interest in the design of tools to assist people in resuming their pre-interruption activity. A user study was conducted to evaluate the use of an interactive event timeline that provides assistance to human supervisors in time-critical settings. The study was conducted in an experimental platform that emulated a team of operators and a mission commander performing a time-critical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission. The study results showed that providing interruption assistance enabled people to recover from interruptions faster and more accurately. These results have implications for interface design that could be adopted in similar time-critical environments such as air-traffic control, process control, and first responders. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"

The voices and the heart rates of eight airline pilots were recorded while completing an advanced flight simulation programme in a level D full flight simulator. Focusing on real-world applicability, the experiments were designed to yield the maximum degree of realism possible. Evaluation of physiological reference measures in pilots demonstrates that several heart rate variability parameters correlate with speech features derived from the recorded data. The article discusses the evolution of speech monitoring in aviation and proposes that application-orientated research methods can be useful in designing a system for real-world monitoring. © IMechE 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.</abstract>"
2014,United States,"Mission, physical, and war stressors' impact on aircrew psychological strain","<title>Mission, physical, and war stressors' impact on aircrew psychological strain</title> <abstract>Background: Little is known about the relative impact of the organization of missions on aircrew well-being. Using an occupational stress model we investigate a previously little studied concept of mission stressors and determine its relative impact in comparison to physical and war stressors in the prediction of four strains in deployed aircrews. Method: Questionnaires were completed by 272 deployed in-aircraft crewmembers. Three new stressors were developed for this study: mission stressors, physical stressors, and war stressors. In addition, four strains were measured: PTSD, depression, sleepiness, and nervousness. Regression analyses were used to examine the relative impact of each stressor on the four strain measures while controlling for age and occupation. Results: All three stressors played a significant role in the prediction strains with the total explained variance in the analyses ranging from 15% and 39%. Interestingly, mission stressors played the most important role in the prediction of strains possessing the largest partial eta squared in each analysis. The second most important stressor was physical stressors followed by war stressors. Conclusion: The importance of mission stressors may be because current training is designed to inoculate crewmembers to stressors such as the physical/environmental conditions and violent war actions, but there is no training or acknowledgment of the importance of dealing with mission stressors. Our findings suggest it might be beneficial for commanders to address these stressors, as it may improve short-term psychological well-being, which may ultimately impact mission success and safety.</abstract>"
2014,Japan,Illusory self-motion (Vection) may be inhibited by hypobaric hypoxia,"<title>Illusory self-motion (Vection) may be inhibited by hypobaric hypoxia</title> <abstract>Introduction: Previous reports have shown that higher altitudes can alter human perception. We add further evidence to this claim, describing a new finding in which higher altitudes inhibit the perception of illusory self-motion, i.e., vection. Method: We compared vection strength under both normal and high altitude (hypobaric hypoxia) conditions. In the high altitude condition, atmospheric pressure in the climatic chamber was decreased to 13,123 ft (4000 m; 492 ft/150 m · min -1) for 28 min and then maintained at the 13,123-ft (4000-m) level for 30 min by a preprogrammed operation. Vection was induced by an optic flow stimulus. Results: Significant differences were observed between the normal and high altitude conditions for all three of the vection strength measurements (latency, duration, and magnitude). Vection was decreased by 14.6%, and S<inf>P</inf>O<inf>2</inf> was decreased by 16.7% in the hypoxia condition. Conclusion: Vection was inhibited in the high altitude condition. Applications of this finding include informing aircraft pilots of this effect of self-motion perception inhibition at higher altitudes to promote safer flying. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2014,China,An integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach to analyze human factors in aviation accidents,"<title>An integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach to analyze human factors in aviation accidents</title> <abstract>Human factors are critical causes of modern aviation accidents. However, existing accident analysis methods encounter limitations in addressing aviation human factors, especially in complex accident scenarios. The existing graphic approaches are effective for describing accident mechanisms within various categories of human factors, but cannot simultaneously describe inadequate human-aircraft-environment interactions and organizational deficiencies effectively, and highly depend on analysts' skills and experiences. Moreover, the existing methods do not emphasize latent unsafe factors outside accidents. This paper focuses on the above three limitations and proposes an integrated graphic-taxonomic-associative approach. A new graphic model named accident tree (AcciTree), with a two-mode structure and a reaction-based concept, is developed for accident modeling and safety defense identification. The AcciTree model is then integrated with the well-established human factors analysis and classification system (HFACS) to enhance both reliability of the graphic part and logicality of the taxonomic part for improving completeness of analysis. An associative hazard analysis technique is further put forward to extend analysis to factors outside accidents, to form extended safety requirements for proactive accident prevention. Two crash examples, a research flight demonstrator by our team and an industrial unmanned aircraft, illustrate that the integrated approach is effective for identifying more unsafe factors and safety requirements. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.</abstract>"

The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of cockpit display dynamics and aircraft type on pilot perceptions of display clutter in simulated flight tasks through statistical analyses of the data gathered across the experimental studies. Comparisons were made on observations of pilots with comparable experience under similar headup or headdown display conditions. In general, this research demonstrated the clutter measures to be highly sensitive to aviation display and domain conditions. The findings also indicated that human information processing considerations in aviation display design coupled with attention to the visual characteristics of display features may provide an effective basis for mitigating potential effects of clutter on pilot performance.

2013,New Zealand - United States,Circadian adaptation of airline pilots during extended duration operations between the USA and Asia,"<title>Circadian adaptation of airline pilots during extended duration operations between the USA and Asia</title> <abstract>This study tracked circadian adaptation among airline pilots before, during, and after trips where they flew from Seattle (SEA) or Los Angeles (LAX) to Asia (7-9 time zones westward), spent 7-12d in Asia, and then flew back to the USA. In Asia, pilots' exposures to local time cues and sleep opportunities were constrained by duty (short-haul flights crossing 1 time zone/24h). Fourteen captains and 16 first officers participated (median age=56 versus 48 yrs, p.U)<0.001). Their sleep was monitored (actigraphy, duty/sleep diaries) from 3d pre-trip to 5d post-trip. For every flight, Karolinska Sleepiness and Samn-Perelli Fatigue scales and 5-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) tests were completed pre-flight and at top of descent (TOD). Participants had 3 d free of duty prior to outbound flight(s). From 72-24h prior to departure (baseline sleep), mean total sleep/24h (TST)=7.00h (SD=1.18h) and mean sleep efficiency=87% (SD=4.9%). Most pilots (23/30) flew direct to and from Asia, but 7 LAX-based pilots flew via a 1-d layover in Honolulu (HNL). On flights with 2 pilots, mean total in-flight sleep varied from 0.40 to 2.09h outbound and from 0.74 to 1.88h inbound. Duty patterns in Asia were variable, with 2 flights/d (mean flight duration=3.53h, SD=0.53h). TST on days 1Â-7 in Asia did not differ from baseline (p.F)=0.2031). However, mean sleep efficiency was significantly lower than baseline on days 5-7 (p.F)=0.0041). More pilots were on duty between 20:00 and 24:00h on days 5Â-7 (mean=21%) than on days 2Â-4 (mean=14%). Sleep propensity distribution phase markers and chi-square periodogram analyses suggest that adaptation to local time was complete by day 4 in Asia. On pre-flight PVT tests in Asia, the slowest 10% of responses improved for flights departing 14:00-19:59h (p.F)=0.0484). At TOD, the slowest 10% of responses improved across days for flights arriving 14:00-19:59h (p.F)=0.0349) and 20:00-01:59h (p.F)=0.0379). Sleepiness and fatigue ratings pre-flight and at TOD did not change across days in Asia. TST on post-trip day 1 was longer than baseline (estimated mean extension=1.68h; adjusted p(t)<0.0001). On all post-trip days, sleep efficiency was comparable to baseline. Sleep propensity distribution phase markers and chi-square periodogram analyses suggest complete readaptation in 1Â-2d. Two opposing influences appeared to affect sleep and PVT performance across days in Asia: progressive circadian adaptation to local time and increasing duty during local night, which displaced sleep from the optimal physiological time. Cumulative sleep restriction across the return flight may explain the large rebound in TST on day 1 post-trip. Thereafter TST, sleep efficiency, and sleep timing suggest that readaptation was complete. Rapid post-trip readaptation may be facilitated by pilots having unconstrained nocturnal sleep opportunities, coupled with stronger patterns of family and social cues than in Asia. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.</abstract>"

Methods: Participants included 18 male airmen at the rank of captain with a history of receiving alcohol dependence treatment and subsequent referral for a fitness-for-duty evaluation. Data from prior comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations conducted in a private practice setting at the mandate of the FAA utilizing criteria outlined in the HIMS program was used. ANOVA was conducted to compare pilots with (N 5 4) and without Cluster B personality features (N 5 14) on measures of decisionmaking capacities, intelligence, and executive functioning. Results: Pilots with Cluster B personality features were found to have a signifi-cantly lower Total Net T-Score on IGT (M 5 35.00, SD 5 9.27) than pilots without features of Cluster B (M 5 56.36, SD 5 9.55). Furthermore, with the exception of the first 20 cards (i.e., Net 1); the groups significantly differed in their Net scores. No statistically significant difference was found on airmen's intelligence and executive functioning. Discussion: The present study found that alcohol-dependent airmen with Cluster B personality features evidenced significantly poorer decisionmaking capacities as measured by the IGT in comparison to alcohol dependent airman without Cluster B personality features.

2013,Australia - United States,Minimizing the disruptive effects of prospective memory in simulated air traffic control,"<title>Minimizing the disruptive effects of prospective memory in simulated air traffic control</title> <abstract>Prospective memory refers to remembering to perform an intended action in the future. Failures of prospective memory can occur in air traffic control. In two experiments, we examined the utility of external aids for facilitating air traffic management in a simulated air traffic control task with prospective memory requirements. Participants accepted and handed-off aircraft and detected aircraft conflicts. The prospective memory task involved remembering to deviate from a routine operating procedure when accepting target aircraft. External aids that contained details of the prospective memory task appeared and flashed when target aircraft needed acceptance. In Experiment 1, external aids presented either adjacent or nonadjacent to each of the 20 target aircraft presented over the 40-min test phase reduced prospective memory error by 11% compared with a condition without external aids. In Experiment 2, only a single target aircraft was presented a significant time (39-42 min) after presentation of the prospective memory instruction, and the external aids reduced prospective memory error by 34%. In both experiments, costs to the efficiency of nonprospective memory air traffic management (nontarget aircraft acceptance response time, conflict detection response time) were reduced by nonadjacent aids compared with no aids or adjacent aids. In contrast, in both experiments, the efficiency of the prospective memory air traffic management (target aircraft acceptance response time) was facilitated by adjacent aids compared with nonadjacent aids. Together, these findings have potential implications for the design of automated alerting systems to maximize multitask performance in work settings where operators monitor and control demanding perceptual displays. © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2013,Australia,Adaptive decision making in a dynamic environment: A test of a sequential sampling model of relative judgment,"<title>Adaptive decision making in a dynamic environment: A test of a sequential sampling model of relative judgment</title> <abstract>Research has identified a wide range of factors that influence performance in relative judgment tasks. However, the findings from this research have been inconsistent. Studies have varied with respect to the identification of causal variables and the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms underlying performance. Drawing on the ecological rationality approach, we present a theory of the judgment and decision-making processes involved in a relative judgment task that explains how people judge a stimulus and adapt their decision process to accommodate their own uncertainty associated with those judgments. Undergraduate participants performed a simulated air traffic control conflict detection task. Across two experiments, we systematically manipulated variables known to affect performance. In the first experiment, we manipulated the relative distances of aircraft to a common destination while holding aircraft speeds constant. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced a direct manipulation of relative speed. We then fit a sequential sampling model to the data, and used the best fitting parameters to infer the decision-making processes responsible for performance. Findings were consistent with the theory that people adapt to their own uncertainty by adjusting their criterion and the amount of time they take to collect evidence in order to make a more accurate decision. From a practical perspective, the paper demonstrates that one can use a sequential sampling model to understand performance in a dynamic environment, allowing one to make sense of and interpret complex patterns of empirical findings that would otherwise be difficult to interpret using standard statistical analyses © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2013,France,Ejection in hostile environments: Medico-psychological aspects for the fighter pilot,"<title>Ejection in hostile environments: Medico-psychological aspects for the fighter pilot</title> <abstract>Introduction: In the French Air Force, commitment of fighter squadrons in Afghanistan revives the fear among pilots of being ejected in a hostile environment, along with the prospect of being captured. Clinical Observations: Although ejection in a hostile environment is an exceptional event, it is what flight crews fear most strongly over enemy territory. Since the widespread use of ejection seats in fighter aircraft in the 1950s, ejection has become a means of protecting the crews ' lives. Ejection is a breaking point when the pilot suddenly passes from an intense activity to a passive position in which he (or she) is often helpless and sometimes exposed to the hostility of the environment where he lands. It is always important to analyze the circumstances surrounding an ejection. Some clinical observations allow us to understand the psycho-traumatic potential of this brutal experience. In a hostile environment, ejection quite rapidly becomes a question of survival. Discussion: The pilot is technically and physically prepared during training. He (or she) regularly trains for the use of the ejection seat and the equipment to protect himself, to report, and ensure his survival until his recovery. Because it is always a singular event, on a case-by-case basis, no psychological reaction to such a situation can be modeled with a view to predicting psycho-traumatic disorders. Conclusion: Since 2007, there has been a medico-psychological supporting device, organized by the French Air Force, to be used after this type of event. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2013,France,Effects of the audiovisual conflict on auditory early processes,"<title>Effects of the audiovisual conflict on auditory early processes</title> <abstract>Auditory alarm misperception is one of the critical events that lead aircraft pilots to an erroneous flying decision. The rarity of these alarms associated with their possible unreliability may play a role in this misperception. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we manipulated both audiovisual conflict and sound rarity in a simplified landing task. Behavioral data and event related potentials (ERPs) of thirteen healthy participants were analyzed. We found that the presentation of a rare auditory signal (i.e. an alarm), incongruent with visual information, led to a smaller amplitude of the auditory N100 (i.e. less negative) compared to the condition in which both signals were congruent. Moreover, the incongruity between the visual information and the rare sound did not significantly affect reaction times, suggesting that the rare sound was neglected. We propose that the lower N100 amplitude reflects an early visual-to-auditory gating that depends on the rarity of the sound. In complex aircraft environments, this early effect might be partly responsible for auditory alarm insensitivity. Our results provide a new basis for future aeronautic studies and the development of countermeasures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract>"
2013,Japan,Two reports of flight-related headache,"<title>Two reports of flight-related headache</title> <abstract>Airplane headache is flight-related and appears during airplane landing and/or takeoff without accompanying symptoms. Intracranial and paranasal imaging studies reveal no abnormalities. The etiology is still uncertain, although sinus barotrauma has been proposed as a possible mechanism. Case Reports: 1) A 26-yr-old woman presented with recurring headache during each air travel since she was 22 yr old. Severe bursting pain suddenly manifested in the bilateral orbits and temples during airplane descent, with no accompanying additional symptoms. She had no unusual medical history. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans showed no abnormalities except thickening of the nasal mucosa. Effective pain relief was obtained with over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray. 2) A 49-yr-old man presented with a 3-yr history of flight-related headache that appeared at airplane touchdown, when he had mental stress, or when he was suffering from a lack of sleep. Pain was of a severe jabbing quality, localized over the forehead with no additional accompanying symptoms. He had a past history of episodic tension-type headache. Intracranial and paranasal CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Headache ceased spontaneously within 40 min of the end of the flight and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug premedication did not prevent the headache. Discussion: Sinus barotrauma was thought to be a plausible explanation for the headache in Case 1. In Case 2, an anxiety disorder could be considered as an underlying etiology. The etiology of so-called airplane headache is probably protean and this should be taken into account when assessing cases of in-flight cephalalgia. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

The aim of this study was to observe and report selected physiological, biochemical, psychological, and performance responses to this intense 15-day program of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) EST. Fourteen RAAF participants undertook the EST course. Physiological and psychological responses were collected across the 15 days across outcomes: (1) biochemical markers (blood lactate, interlukin-6, and creatine kinase), (2) performance and anthropometric indices (vertical jump, body mass), and (3) psychological questionnaires profile of mood states, depression anxiety stress scale, Kessler-10 etc.). Creatine kinase concentration increased significantly from baseline to day 5 (p < 0.05) and thereafter remained elevated for the remaining 10 days of EST (128%; p < 0.01). Vertical jump (-10%; p < 0.01) and body mass (-8%; p < 0.01) both decreased across 15 days of EST, while there were no significant change in interlukin-6. Negative psychological responses were observed for mood (p < 0.01), depression (p < 0.05), anxiety (p < 0.01), and stress (p < 0.01) following the EST course. This case study showed the RAAF EST course imposed significant physiological and psychological stress as observed from markers of muscle damage, deterioration in physical performance, substantial weight loss, negative mood, and psychological distress. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

A repeated-measures, counterbalanced, mixed study design was used to examine differences in working memory, spatial orientation, and cognitive flight performance of 40 randomly selected healthy pilots after having high and low fluid intakes. Serial weights were also analyzed to determine differences in cognitive flight performance of the dehydrated (1-3% weight loss) and hydrated study participants. Results showed flight performance and spatial cognition test scores were significantly (p < 0.05) poorer for pilots who had low fluid intakes and experienced dehydration in comparison to the hydrated pilots. These findings indicate fluid intake differences resulting in dehydration may have safety implications because peak cognitive performance among pilots is critical for flight safety. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

In the latent stage, psychology, types and demand of passengers need to be fully considered, such as four principles (respond fast, keep staff present, let the leader on duty come to coordinate and provide both standard and personal services), six arrangements (elementary service, delay information, travel arrangement, compensation plan, complaint channel, track investigation), so as to prevent and control outbreak of mass incidents of passengers. In the outbreak stage, the airline should isolate the key passengers and contact the airport police and media. In the subside stage, the airline should evacuate passengers as soon as possible.</abstract>"
2013,Puerto Rico - Sudan - United States,Introducing Survival Ethics into Engineering Education and Practice,"<title>Introducing Survival Ethics into Engineering Education and Practice</title> <abstract>Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life. This crisis calls for an ethics that furnishes effective motives to take global action necessary for survival. We propose a research program for understanding why ethical principles change across time and culture. We also propose provisional motives and methods for reaching global consensus on engineering field ethics. Current interdisciplinary research in ethics, psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary theory grounds these proposals. Experimental ethics, the application of scientific principles to ethical studies, provides a model for developing policies to advance solutions. A growing literature proposes evolutionary explanations for moral development. Connecting these approaches necessitates an experimental or scientific ethics that deliberately examines theories of morality for reliability. To illustrate how such an approach works, we cover three areas. The first section analyzes cross-cultural ethical systems in light of evolutionary theory. While such research is in its early stages, its assumptions entail consequences for engineering education. The second section discusses Howard University and University of Puerto Rico/Mayagüez (UPRM) courses that bring ethicists together with scientists and engineers to unite ethical theory and practice. We include a syllabus for engineering and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) ethics courses and a checklist model for translating educational theory and practice into community action. The model is based on aviation, medicine and engineering practice. The third and concluding section illustrates Howard University and UPRM efforts to translate engineering educational theory into community action. Multidisciplinary teams of engineering students and instructors take their expertise from the classroom to global communities to examine further the ethicality of prospective technologies and the decision-making processes that lead to them. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</abstract>"
2013,China,The effects of risk perception and flight experience on airline pilots' locus of control with regard to safety operation behaviors,"<title>The effects of risk perception and flight experience on airline pilots' locus of control with regard to safety operation behaviors</title> <abstract>The primary objective of this paper was to integrate two research traditions, social cognition approach and individual state approach, and to understand the relationships between locus of control (LOC), risk perception, flight time, and safety operation behavior (SOB) among Chinese airline pilots. The study sample consisted of 193 commercial airline pilots from China Southern Airlines Ltd. The results showed that internal locus of control directly affected pilot safety operation behavior. Risk perception seemed to mediate the relationship between locus of control and safety operation behaviors, and total flight time moderated internal locus of control. Thus, locus of control primarily influences safety operation behavior indirectly by affecting risk perception. The total effect of internal locus of control on safety behaviors is larger than that of external locus of control. Furthermore, the safety benefit of flight experience is more pronounced among pilots with high internal loci of control in the early and middle flight building stages. Practical implications for aviation safety and directions for future research are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2013,Norway - Sweden - United Kingdom - United States,The role of psychological capital in perception of safety climate among air traffic controllers,"<title>The role of psychological capital in perception of safety climate among air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>Previous research has shown that psychological capital (PsyCap) is associated with desired employee behavioral and performance outcomes. Extending previous research, we examine, in two studies, if the PsyCap of Norwegian air traffic controllers is related to their perceptions of safety climate. Based on bootstrapping procedures, results from Study 1 (N = 77) and Study 2 (N = 38) revealed that PsyCap was positively correlated with safety climate. In Study 1, PsyCap explained 31% of the variance in safety climate. Controlling for mediating effects of positive and negative emotions in Study 2, PsyCap explained 15.5% of the variance. These results provide first-time empirical evidence linking PsyCap to safety climate in safety critical organizations. © Baker College 2013.</abstract>"
2013,United States,Technical and operational users' opinions of a handheld device to detect directed energy,"<title>Technical and operational users' opinions of a handheld device to detect directed energy</title> <abstract>Introduction: Lasers, a form of directed energy (DE), are a threat to pilots and Air Force personnel. In light of this threat, a handheld medical device called the "" Tricorder "" is under development to improve situational awareness of DE. Current operational procedures do not include methods for recording or handling new information regarding DE. The purpose of this study was to understand Air Force personnel opinions and beliefs about desired features and operational use to enhance user acceptance of the Tricorder. Method: Q-methodology was implemented to study opinions and beliefs related to DE. Two groups were approached, medical personnel in the Illinois Air National Guard and four active duty members of an Air Force Rescue Squadron. Both groups completed the same Q-sort of both operational and equipment concerns. Results: Six opinion sets regarding operational concerns described 61% of the total variation in perceptions among participants. The factors were: concern over health effects, implications to individuals, combat/tactical concerns, force health protection, and theater/tactical concerns. Five opinion sets described 68% of the variation in the equipment functions perceived as most important. The participants indicated that ideally the device should measure exposure, enhance laser detection/ response, support night vision and ease of use, detect threats, and enhance combat medicine. Conclusion: This survey revealed the complexity of equipment and the operational implications of detecting DE. Q-methodology is a unique strategy to both evaluate technology and explore users' concerns. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2013,France,Fuzzy-TLX: Using fuzzy integrals for evaluating human mental workload with NASA-Task Load indeX in laboratory and field studies,"<title>Fuzzy-TLX: Using fuzzy integrals for evaluating human mental workload with NASA-Task Load indeX in laboratory and field studies</title> <abstract>The aim of this study was to assess mental workload in which various load sources must be integrated to derive reliable workload estimates. We report a new algorithm for computing weights from qualitative fuzzy integrals and apply it to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -Task Load indeX (NASA-TLX) subscales in order to replace the standard pair-wise weighting technique (PWT). In this paper, two empirical studies were reported: (1) In a laboratory experiment, age- and task-related variables were investigated in 53 male volunteers and (2) In a field study, task- and job-related variables were studied on aircrews during 48 commercial flights. The results found in this study were as follows: (i) in the experimental setting, fuzzy estimates were highly correlated with classical (using PWT) estimates; (ii) in real work conditions, replacing PWT by automated fuzzy treatments simplified the NASA-TLX completion; (iii) the algorithm for computing fuzzy estimates provides a new classification procedure sensitive to various variables of work environments and (iv) subjective and objective measures can be used for the fuzzy aggregation of NASA-TLX subscales. Practitioner Summary: NASA-TLX, a classical tool for mental workload assessment, is based on a weighted sum of ratings from six subscales. A new algorithm, which impacts on input data collection and computes weights and indexes from qualitative fuzzy integrals, is evaluated through laboratory and field studies. Pros and cons are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2013,Canada,Simulated night vision goggle wear and colored aftereffects,"<title>Simulated night vision goggle wear and colored aftereffects</title> <abstract>Background: Surveys of military pilots report that between 1.6% and 65% of the respondents experienced altered color vision after night vision goggle (NVG) wear. For the majority of these pilots, the aftereffect was a brownish afterimage that lasted less than 10 min. Given the large disparity in the surveys, we asked subjects to wear goggles which simulated NVGs to determine the nature and duration of any color aftereffects after removing the goggles. Methods: Two separate experiments were conducted after wearing the goggles for 30 continuous minutes. The first measured the adaptation effects on color appearance by determining the spectral locations of unique blue and unique yellow. The second measured the adaptation effects on color discrimination using the Lanthony Desaturated D15 (Desat D15) color vision test. Results: The location of unique blue shifted to a longer wavelength by 4 nm immediately after removing the goggles and returned to baseline by 12 min post-wear. The unique yellow location was unaffected by the color aftereffect. In the second experiment, the time to complete the Desat D15 was 13% longer than baseline for the first 6 min post-wear. There was also a decrease in the frequency of errors relative to baseline. Only one subject reported an afterimage in either experiment. Conclusions: The results showed that the color aftereffects were subtle and unlikely to cause major color vision problems. The time course of the color aftereffect in this experiment resembled short-term adaptation effects. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

2013,Australia,The moderating effect of individual differences in error-management training: Who learns from mistakes?,"<title>The moderating effect of individual differences in error-management training: Who learns from mistakes?</title> <abstract>Objective: We investigated the effectiveness of error-encouragement training and the influence of ability and personality attribute-treatment interactions using a dynamic decision-making task. Background: Error-encouragement training is said to be more effective than error-avoidance training because active exploration and error encouragement promote better learning and transfer. Past research, which is limited by confounded experimental designs involving simple tasks with little consideration of individual differences, provides evidence for the value of active exploration but less so for error encouragement. Method: We randomly allocated 164 participants to receive error-encouragement, error-avoidance, or no error-related instructions in training on ATC-lab, a dynamic computer simulated air traffic control task. Active exploration and task information were controlled, and ability and personality were assessed. Results: Error encouragement yielded better transfer performance than did error avoidance but was no better than the control training. Higher- rather than lower-ability trainees benefited from training with an error orientation (positive or negative), suggesting that learning from errors in training requires greater cognitive resources. Trainees higher in openness to experience and agreeableness performed more poorly with error-avoidance training than with error-encouragement and control training. Conclusion: Error-avoidance training had a detrimental effect especially for those less open to experience, lower in agreeableness, and of lower ability. The significant benefits of error-encouragement training reported in previous research were probably attributable to confounding factors, such as active exploration and differential task information. Application: Although errors and active exploration can be useful learning tools in training, trainers should be mindful that focusing on errors, whether positively or negatively, may not suit everyone.

Sixteen participants used an eye tracker to select targets displayed on a screen as quickly and accurately as possible. We assessed the impact of the presence of visual feedback about gaze position and the method of target selection on selection performance under different difficulty levels induced by variations in target size and target-to-target separation. We tend to consider that the combined use of gaze dwell-time selection and continuous eye-gaze feedback was the best condition as it suits naturally with gaze displacement over the ATC display and free the hands of the controller, despite a small cost in terms of selection speed. In addition, target size had a greater impact on accuracy and selection time than target distance. These findings provide guidelines on possible further implementation of eye tracking in ATC everyday activity.Practitioner Summary: We investigated the possibility to integrate a free head motion eye-tracking system as input device in air traffic control (ATC). We found that the combined use of gaze dwell-time selection and continuous eye-gaze feedback allowed the best performance and that target size had a greater impact on performance than target distance. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

This study sought to assess frequency of fl ying while acutely ill, identify clinical triggers in self-grounding, determine employer support for self-grounding, examine rates of infl uenza vaccination, and identify unmet needs for current information on ID issues related to extensive travel required of professional aircrews. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires were completed by select European mainline, U.S. regional airline, and professional corporate aircrews on ID topics such as fl ying while ill, fl ying with ill crewmembers, receipt of infl uenza vaccination, disinfection, and other aviation medical issues. Data were analyzed and reported as composite and stratifi ed by airline vs. corporate aviation respondents. Results: Aircrews often fl ew while ill (or with ill crewmembers); 52% fl ew until fever reached 38°C (100.4°F) and an additional 37% fl ew up to 38.89°C (102°F). Rate of annual infl uenza vaccination was quite low for all groups, but especially so for airline crews (21 - 27%), even given potential occupational exposure risk. Crews also had strongly differing perceptions of employer views on self-grounding, depending upon employment setting. Conclusions: There were sizable disparities between aircrew fl ying for U.S. regional, European mainline, and large corporate aviation departments with respect to self-grounding when ill and routinely receiving a seasonal infl uenza vaccination. All study groups reported a pressing need for enhanced anonymous access to current ID and medical information. © By the Aerospace Medical Association Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

In addition, personality traits, gender and marital status are examined as moderators in the effects on the turnover intention of an air traffic controller. The results show that the turnover intention of controllers increases as the job stress becomes heavier. In addition to the direct effect, turnover intention is also influenced by job stress indirectly through job satisfaction. Job stress and job performance are negatively correlated while job performance and turnover intention have no relationship. As for the moderators, different personality traits of air traffic controllers have different effects on job stress. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract>"

Aims: This study was planned to find the effects of physical and mental workload on taste sensitivity and salivary stress biomarkers. Materials and Methods: Twelve crew members were selected. Taste reactions and intensity of the taste sensations to quinine sulfate, citric acid, and sucrose were tested before and after mental and physical tasks for one hour. Also, psychological mood states by profile of mood state, salivary, salivary alpha amylase and cortisol, and current stress test scores were measured before and after mental and physical tasks. Results: Average time intensity evaluation showed that after the mental and physical tasks, the perceived duration of bitter, sour, and sweet taste sensations was significantly shortened relative to control group. There were good correlations between average time intensity of sweetness, bitterness, sourness and cortisol levels. Conclusions: Taste alterations due to stress can have an effect on the health and confidence of astronauts in long- term space missions. Thus, this issue remains one of the important issues for future human explorations.</abstract>"
2012,New Zealand,Hypoxia training: Symptom replication in experienced military aircrew,"<title>Hypoxia training: Symptom replication in experienced military aircrew</title> <abstract>Introduction: Military aircrew are trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoxia in a safe environment using a variety of methods to simulate altitude. In order to investigate the effectiveness of hypoxia training, this study compared the recall of hypoxia symptoms in military aircrew between two consecutive hypobaric chamber hypoxia training sessions conducted, on average, 4.5 yr apart. Methods: Previously trained subjects completed a questionnaire immediately before and after they underwent refresher hypoxia training and recorded the occurrence, order, and severity of symptoms experienced. Responses from refresher training were compared with their recall of symptoms experienced during previous training. Results: There was no difference in the recall of most hypoxia symptoms between training sessions. Slurred speech was recalled more frequently from previous training compared to refresher training (14 vs. 4 subjects), whereas hot/cold flushes were recalled less frequently from previous training compared to refresher training (5 vs. 17 subjects). There was a statistically significant difference in overall hypoxia score (10.3 vs. 8.3), suggesting that from memory subjects may underestimate the level of hypoxia experienced in previous training. Discussion: A high level of similarity between the recall of previously experienced hypoxia symptoms and recent experience supports the effectiveness of hypoxia training. These results replicate the finding of a ' hypoxia signature'reported by a previous study. Small differences in the recall of some symptoms and in overall hypoxia score highlight the importance of drawing attention to the more subtle symptoms of early hypoxia, and of using training techniques which optimize aircrew recall.

2012,Germany - United States,Effective rotations: Action effects determine the interplay of mental and manual rotations,"<title>Effective rotations: Action effects determine the interplay of mental and manual rotations</title> <abstract>The last decades have seen a growing interest in the impact of action on perception and other concurrent cognitive processes. One particularly interesting example is that manual rotation actions facilitate mental rotations in the same direction. The present study extends this research in two fundamental ways. First, Experiment 1 demonstrates that not only manual rotations facilitate mental rotations but that mental rotations also facilitate subsequent manual rotations. Second, Experiments 2 and 3 targeted the mechanisms underlying this interplay. Here, manual steering wheel rotations produced salient visual effects, namely the rotation of either a plane or a horizon in an aviation display. The rotation direction of these visual effects either did or did not correspond to the direction of the manual rotation itself. These experiments clearly demonstrate an impact of sensory action effects: Mental rotations facilitate manual rotations with visual effects of the same direction (as the mental rotation), irrespective of the direction of the manual rotation. These findings highlight the importance of effect anticipation in action planning. As such they support the contentions of ideomotor theory and shed new light on the cognitive source of the interplay between visual imagery and motor control. © 2012 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2012,China - Germany,Body posture as an indicator of workload in mental work,"<title>Body posture as an indicator of workload in mental work</title> <abstract>Objective: For this article, the relationships between body posture and workload for four mental tasks simulated on a computer were studied. Background: Human behaviors are observable during work and are related to human mental activities. A novel supplementary method, based on human behavior but not directly related to task execution, is proposed to assess the workload in mental work situations. Method: Body posture was quantitatively analyzed with the use of a video-based analysis system. The distance between a participants head and the display, the distance between the shoulder and the hip, and the trunk angle of the shoulder and the hip with respect to the gravitational field were calculated. Results: The various tasks affected the distance between the head and the display (p < .001) and the trunk angle (p < .001). The distance between the head and the display decreased with increasing workload (p = .007). Conclusion: These results indicate that body posture can be used as an indicator for overall workload assessment. Application: The proposed method of workload may be useful for real-time observations or the monitoring of mental states in mental work environments (e.g., rail traffic dispatching, air traffic control).

Methods: The subjects in this study were nine Japan air self-defense force pilots who participated in Iraq reconstruction support activity in Kuwait. Amy was measured using a portable salivary amylase monitor at preflight, postflight, and on stand-by day. In addition, the state-trait anxiety inventory was administered with state scores (STAI-S) compared to Amy levels. Results: There were greater differences in Amy levels at baseline compared to STAI-S scores between subjects on the stand-by day. Amy levels at preflight tended to increase compared to those on stand-by day as did STAI-S. The change in Amy level at postflight varied among the pilots. The Amy levels of four subjects at postflight were elevated compared to levels at preflight, while the STAI-S scores for all pilots at postflight were lower than at preflight. Conclusions: This study suggests that the Amy level of pilots can reflect subtle individual differences in response to the psychological and physiological stress of a flight task. Thus, monitoring Amy level may be useful for stress evaluation of pilots working in a stressful environment, providing data that might be used as an impetus for addressing stress management for this population. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract>"
2012,India,Psychological factors post military aircrew selection: A clinical perspective,"<title>Psychological factors post military aircrew selection: A clinical perspective</title> <abstract>Military aircrews undergo rigorous psychological and medical testing during the selection process. This paper discusses information gained from aircrew who have been referred for clinical psychological evaluation for four main reasons i) fear of flying (FOF), ii) loss of motivation to fly/failing aviator syndrome, iii) traumatic experiences such as an ejection or Prisoner of War (POW) experience, and iv) psychological factors affecting medical conditions such as those in musculoskeletal disorders. Projective evaluation using Rorschach indicated different patterns of emotional and perceptual responses in referred clinical and non clinical aircrew groups. Aeronautical adaptability which consists of flying ability, emotional stability and motivation to fly are characteristics which have to be considered when designing new selection tests with high predictive validity. Inputs from pilots who undergo evaluation in the mid career stage can help delineate important and relevant psychological characteristics which need to be screened at the aircrew selection stage. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.</abstract>"

In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well. © 2012 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2012,Australia,Restricted sleep and negative affective states in commercial pilots during short haul operations,"<title>Restricted sleep and negative affective states in commercial pilots during short haul operations</title> <abstract>This study aims to investigate (1) the relationship between restricted sleep and Heightened Emotional Activity (HEA) during normal flight operations, and (2) whether sleep patterns influence the strength of the HEA as a response to threats. Accident investigation reports continue to highlight the relationship between restricted sleep and poor safety outcomes. However, to date we have a limited understanding of how sleep and HEA interact. A total of 302 sectors of normal airline flight operations were observed by trained observers, and instances of heightened emotional activity were recorded. During the cruise phase of each of these sectors, crew members were asked to calculate the amount of sleep they had obtained in previous 24 and 48 h. In the 302 sectors of normal flight operations, 535 instances of HEA were observed. Descriptive analyses of instances of HEA and sleep in the prior 24 and 48 h showed a significant relationship between the occurrence of HEA and recent sleep. The relationship between restricted sleep and HEA suggests that there may well be further implications with respect to operational safety. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2012,United States,"Common sense reasoning for detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyberbullying","<title>Common sense reasoning for detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyberbullying</title> <abstract>Cyberbullying (harassment on social networks) is widely recognized as a serious social problem, especially for adolescents. It is as much a threat to the viability of online social networks for youth today as spam once was to email in the early days of the Internet. Current work to tackle this problem has involved social and psychological studies on its prevalence as well as its negative effects on adolescents. While true solutions rest on teaching youth to have healthy personal relationships, few have considered innovative design of social network software as a tool for mitigating this problem. Mitigating cyberbullying involves two key components: robust techniques for effective detection and reflective user interfaces that encourage users to reflect upon their behavior and their choices. Spam filters have been successful by applying statistical approaches like Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. They can, like Googles GMail, aggregate human spam judgments because spam is sent nearly identically to many people. Bullying is more personalized, varied, and contextual. In this work, we present an approach for bullying detection based on state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense knowledge base, which permits recognition over a broad spectrum of topics in everyday life. We analyze a more narrow range of particular subject matter associated with bullying (e.g. appearance, intelligence, racial and ethnic slurs, social acceptance, and rejection), and construct BullySpace, a common sense knowledge base that encodes particular knowledge about bullying situations. We then perform joint reasoning with common sense knowledge about a wide range of everyday life topics. We analyze messages using our novel AnalogySpace common sense reasoning technique. We also take into account social network analysis and other factors. We evaluate the model on real-world instances that have been reported by users on Formspring, a social networking website that is popular with teenagers. On the intervention side, we explore a set of reflective user-interaction paradigms with the goal of promoting empathy among social network participants. We propose an ""air traffic control""-like dashboard, which alerts moderators to large-scale outbreaks that appear to be escalating or spreading and helps them prioritize the current deluge of user complaints. For potential victims, we provide educational material that informs them about how to cope with the situation, and connects them with emotional support from others. A user evaluation shows that in-context, targeted, and dynamic help during cyberbullying situations fosters end-user reflection that promotes better coping strategies. © 2012 ACM.</abstract>"

Objective: The intention was to compare a modified version of the standard EMDR protocol for the reduction of performance anxiety and the enhancement of performance. Method: The method was applying the special EMDR protocol for peak performance with higher functioning clients. A further enhancement applied three empirically valid techniques drawn from the subfield of positive psychology. Results: Published case studies suggest that this special EMDR protocol aided an experienced commercial pilot in overcoming his avoidance and returning to the flight simulator following a failed proficiency check, and assisted an executive in managing his sense of failure following a significant business setback. Athletes preparing for competition have also found the protocol assists them in managing precompetition anxiety. A further enhancement is the application of three techniques drawn from positive psychology which the empirical research in this subfield of psychology suggests can further enhance the benefits of this protocol. Conclusion: Limitations are discussed and recommendations for future research are outlined. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

To facilitate the understanding of diagnostic errors in real-world primary care settings that use electronic health records (EHRs), this study explored the use of the situational awareness (SA) framework from aviation human factors research. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted involving reviews of EHR data followed by semi-structured interviews of selected providers from two institutions in the USA. The study population included 380 consecutive patients with colorectal and lung cancers diagnosed between February 2008 and January 2009. Using a pre-tested data collection instrument, trained physicians identified diagnostic errors, defined as lack of timely action on one or more established indications for diagnostic work-up for lung and colorectal cancers. Twenty-six providers involved in cases with and without errors were interviewed. Interviews probed for providers' lack of SA and how this may have influenced the diagnostic process. Results: Of 254 cases meeting inclusion criteria, errors were found in 30 of 92 (32.6%) lung cancer cases and 56 of 167 (33.5%) colorectal cancer cases. Analysis of interviews related to error cases revealed evidence of lack of one of four levels of SA applicable to primary care practice: information perception, information comprehension, forecasting future events, and choosing appropriate action based on the first three levels.

Conclusions: A framework of SA can help analyse and understand diagnostic errors in primary care settings that use EHRs.</abstract>"
2011,United States,Recollection of hypoxia symptoms between training events,"<title>Recollection of hypoxia symptoms between training events</title> <abstract>Introduction: The well-established technique of mask-off hypoxia training in a hypobaric training environment elicits symptoms that are correlated with in-flight symptoms reported by aircrew. Aircrew receive training on recognition of symptoms and response early in their flying career and accomplish refresher training on a 5-yr cycle. The symptoms reported after acute hypoxia represent cognitive and psychomotor impairment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of symptoms experienced during hypoxia training and recall of symptoms from the training sessions 5 yr previously. Methods: A survey listing 18 symptoms of hypoxia and severity of condition was presented to 1123 aircrew attending refresher training at 10 U.S. Air Force Aerospace Physiology Training Units prior to and immediately following hypoxia training in the hypobaric chamber. Results: The five symptoms most commonly reported following hypoxia training are: lightheaded/dizzy, dizziness, mental confusion, visual impairment, and tingling. The hypoxia symptom ""lightheaded/dizzy"" recorded the highest frequency of all 18 symptoms. Lightheaded/dizzy frequencies for both previous and current hypoxia training were 67.2% and 72.3%, respectively. This symptom remained consistent throughout all data analysis, retaining the highest frequency in all levels of severity (mild, moderate, and extreme) for both the previous hypoxia training and current hypoxia training. Discussion: The similarity of symptoms recalled between hypoxia training events provides strong evidence that hypoxia training is an effective method of establishing recognized decrements that may influence performance in flight. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is stimulated through elevated noradrenaline levels. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the potential exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in a clinical sample of participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for a specific phobia (fear of flying). Methods: Sixty-seven participants with fear of flying were randomized to 4 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) combined with YOH (10 mg), or 4 sessions of VRET combined with a placebo. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour exposure sessions consisting of two 25-minute virtual flights. At pre-and post-treatment, fear of flying was assessed. The YOH or placebo capsules were administered 1 h prior to exposures. The manipulation of the noradrenaline activity was confirmed by salivary α-amylase (sAA) samples taken pre-, during and post-exposure. Results: Forty-eight participants completed treatment. Manipulation of noradrenaline levels with YOH was successful, with significantly higher levels of sAA in the YOH group when entering exposure. Results showed that both groups improved significantly from pre-to post-treatment with respect to anxiety reduction. However, although the manipulation of noradrenaline activity was successful, there was no evidence that YOH enhanced outcome. Conclusions: Participants improved significantly on anxiety measures independently of drug condition, after 4 sessions of VRET. These data do not support the initial findings of exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in this dosage in clinical populations. © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.</abstract>"
2011,United States,Physiological and psychological characteristics of successful combat controller trainees.,"<title>Physiological and psychological characteristics of successful combat controller trainees.</title> <abstract>The United States Air Force (USAF) Combat Controller (CCT) training pipeline is extremely arduous and historically has an attrition rate of 70-80%. The primary objective of this study was to identify the physiological, psychological, or demographical characteristics associated with successful progression through the CCT pipeline program. A battery of physiological measurements, biographical information, and psychological tests were used to determine the profile of a successful CCT trainee. These measures were chosen on the basis of being standard physical fitness parameters, CCT-specific physical attribute indicators or validated psychological surveys. A multiple of physical tests served as measurements for cardiovascular endurance (VO2max and running economy), ?anaerobic? capacity (Wingate power and loaded anaerobic endurance treadmill tests), body composition skinfolds measurements, power (Wingate and vertical jump), and reaction time (Makoto eye-hand test.) Each test was conducted using a standardized protocol. Psychological characteristics were explored through use of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP-NEO) and the Mental Toughness Questionnaire 48 (MTQ 48). Our findings revealed the following mean characteristics of 109 CCTs who completed Phase I of the pipeline and achieved their 3-level rating: 23 years old, 1.8m tall, 81 kg, 12% body fat, VO2max of 59 ml/kg/min, vertical jump of 62 cm, able to generate 11.4 W/kg peak power and 9.3 W/Kg mean power during Wingate tests, overall mental toughness rating of 8 (out of 10) with high levels of extraversion and conscientiousness and low levels of neuroticism. The most popular competitive sport played in high school was football, followed by track, wrestling, and baseball. The results of the investigation confirm that CCT trainees who have achieved a 3-level rating possess much higher than average levels of aerobic and anaerobic fitness, power, mental toughness, extraversion and conscientiousness. They possess lower than average levels of neuroticism and openness to experience. These results may prove useful in refining the selection criteria and in designing training for CCT trainees. 2011.</abstract>"
2011,France,Representational Momentum in Aviation,"<title>Representational Momentum in Aviation</title> <abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of expertise on motion anticipation. We conducted 2 experiments in which novices and expert pilots viewed simulated aircraft landing scenes. The scenes were interrupted by the display of a black screen and then started again after a forward or backward shift. The participant's task was to determine whether the moving scene had been shifted forward or backward. A forward misjudgment of the final position of the moving scene was interpreted as a representational momentum (RM) effect. Experiment 1 showed that an RM effect was detected only for experts. The lack of motion anticipation on the part of novices is a surprising result for the RM literature. It could be related to scene unfamiliarity, encoding time, or shift size. Experiment 2 was run with novices only. It was aimed at testing the potential impact of 2 factors on the RM effect: scene encoding time and shift size. As a whole, the results showed that encoding time and shift size are important factors in anticipation processes in realistic dynamic situations. © 2011 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2011,France,Cognitive aging and flight performances in general aviation pilots,"<title>Cognitive aging and flight performances in general aviation pilots</title> <abstract>Unlike professional pilots who are limited by the FAA's age rule, no age limit is defined in general aviation. Our overall goal was to examine how age-related cognitive decline impacts piloting performance and weather-related decision-making. This study relied on three components: cognitive assessment (in particular executive functioning), pilot characteristics (age and flight experience), and flight performance. The results suggest that in comparison to chronological age, cognitive assessment is a better criterion to predict the flight performance, in particular because of the inter-individual variability of aging impact on cognitive abilities and the beneficial effect of flight experience. © 2011 Psychology Press.</abstract>"
2011,United States,Comparison of myocardial ischemia during intense mental stress using flight simulation in airline pilots with coronary artery disease to that produced with conventional mental and treadmill exercise stress testing,"<title>Comparison of myocardial ischemia during intense mental stress using flight simulation in airline pilots with coronary artery disease to that produced with conventional mental and treadmill exercise stress testing</title> <abstract>Mental stress increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although laboratory mental stress often causes less myocardial ischemia than exercise stress (ES), it is unclear whether mental stress is intrinsically different or differences are due to less hemodynamic stress with mental stress. We sought to evaluate the hemodynamic and ischemic response to intense realistic mental stress created by modern flight simulators and compare this response to that of exercise treadmill testing and conventional laboratory mental stress (CMS) testing in pilots with coronary disease. Sixteen airline pilots with angiographically documented coronary disease and documented myocardial ischemia during ES were studied using maximal treadmill ES, CMS, and aviation mental stress (AMS) testing. AMS testing was done in a sophisticated simulator using multiple system failures as stressors. Treadmill ES testing resulted in the highest heart rate, but AMS caused a higher blood pressure response than CMS. Maximal ratepressure product was not significantly different between ES and AMS (25,646 vs 23,347, p = 0.08), although these were higher than CMS (16,336, p <0.0001). Despite similar hemodynamic stress induced by ES and AMS, AMS resulted in significantly less ST-segment depression and nuclear ischemia than ES. Differences in induction of ischemia by mental stress compared to ES do not appear to be due to the creation of less hemodynamic stress. In conclusion, even with equivalent hemodynamic stress, intense realistic mental stress induced by flight simulators results in significantly less myocardial ischemia than ES as measured by ST-segment depression and nuclear ischemia. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

2011,Belgium - United Kingdom - United States,Stereotype-based modulation of person perception,"<title>Stereotype-based modulation of person perception</title> <abstract>A core social-psychological question is how cultural stereotypes shape our encounters with other people. While there is considerable evidence to suggest that unexpected targets-such as female airline pilots and male nurses-impact the inferential and memorial aspects of person construal, it has yet to be established if early perceptual operations are similarly sensitive to the stereotype-related status of individuals. To explore this issue, the current investigation measured neural activity while participants made social (i.e., sex categorization) and non-social (i.e., dot detection) judgments about men and women portrayed in expected and unexpected occupations. When participants categorized the stimuli according to sex, stereotype-inconsistent targets elicited increased activity in cortical areas associated with person perception and conflict resolution. Comparable effects did not emerge during a non-social judgment task. These findings begin to elucidate how and when stereotypic beliefs modulate the formation of person percepts in the brain. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.</abstract>"

The use of intelligence test batteries and cognitive batteries also forms an integral part of testing to assess the intellectual abilities and memory performance of potential astronaut candidates. The objective of the present study was to assess the verbal, performance and full scale IQs in medically fit Indian military aviators. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence test battery was administered to 50 healthy aircrew in an initial effort to establish baseline data for intellectual abilities in this population. The mean (SD) Verbal IQ of the group was 110.26 (7.84), the mean Performance IQ of the aircrew was 115.38 (7.10), and the mean Full Scale IQ was 114.26 (6.37). There were no significant differences of intellectual abilities based on demographic characteristics. There was a positive correlation between Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Full Scale IQ scores. There were no significant correlations between verbal subtests. Data obtained in medical evaluation of grounded pilots can be compared with these normal aircrew and it can also be used as reference data in astronaut crews' selection and screening process. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.</abstract>"
2011,Sweden,Sleep problems and psychosocial work environment among Swedish commercial pilots,"<title>Sleep problems and psychosocial work environment among Swedish commercial pilots</title> <abstract>Background: The aim of this study was to assess relationships between sleeping problems and the psychosocial work situation based on the job-strain and iso-strain models among Swedish commercial pilots. Methods: Three hundred fifty-four pilots participated (61%), who are in 2008 responded to a questionnaire concerning sleep problems, the psychosocial work situation, personal factors, and flight length. Results: Low social support was associated with sleep problems for pilots. High demands were associated with sleep problems among captains and long-haul flights were associated with sleep problems among first officers. Low skill discretion was associated with less sleep problems among first officers. Conclusions: Psychosocial climate at work such as low social support affects negatively sleep for both captains and for first officers. More research on what creates a best social support for pilots and cabin crew is needed. Adjusting scheduling work crew teams could increase social support at work and contribute to a better sleep quality. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</abstract>"
2011,Ireland - United States,Stress training improves performance during a stressful flight,"<title>Stress training improves performance during a stressful flight</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigated whether stress training introduced during the acquisition of simulator-based flight skills enhances pilot performance during subsequent stressful flight operations in an actual aircraft.Background: Despite knowledge that preconditions to aircraft accidents can be strongly influenced by pilot stress, little is known about the effectiveness of stress training and how it transfers to operational flight settings. Method: For this study, 30 participants with no flying experience were assigned at random to a stress-trained treatment group or a control group. Stress training consisted of systematic pairing of skill acquisition in a flight simulator with stress coping mechanisms in the presence of a cold pressor. Control participants received identical flight skill acquisition training but without stress training. Participants then performed a stressful flying task in a Piper Archer aircraft. Results: Stress-trained research participants flew the aircraft more smoothly, as recorded by aircraft telemetry data, and generally better, as recorded by flight instructor evaluations, than did control participants. Conclusions: Introducing stress coping mechanisms during flight training improved performance in a stressful flying task. Application: The results of this study indicate that stress training during the acquisition of flight skills may serve to enhance pilot performance in stressful operational flight and, therefore, might mitigate the contribution of pilot stress to aircraft mishaps. © 2011, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2011,United States,An exploration of the utility of mathematical modeling predicting fatigue from sleep/wake history and circadian phase applied in accident analysis and prevention: The crash of Comair Flight 5191,"<title>An exploration of the utility of mathematical modeling predicting fatigue from sleep/wake history and circadian phase applied in accident analysis and prevention: The crash of Comair Flight 5191</title> <abstract>On 27 August 2006 at 0606 eastern daylight time (EDT) at Bluegrass Airport in Lexington, KY (LEX), the flight crew of Comair Flight 5191 inadvertently attempted to take off from a general aviation runway too short for their aircraft. The aircraft crashed killing 49 of the 50 people on board. To better understand this accident and to aid in preventing similar accidents, we applied mathematical modeling predicting fatigue-related degradation in performance for the Air Traffic Controller on-duty at the time of the crash. To provide the necessary input to the model, we attempted to estimate circadian phase and sleep/wake histories for the Captain, First Officer, and Air Traffic Controller. We were able to estimate with confidence the circadian phase for each. We were able to estimate with confidence the sleep/wake history for the Air Traffic Controller, but unable to do this for the Captain and First Officer. Using the sleep/wake history estimates for the Air Traffic Controller as input, the mathematical modeling predicted moderate fatigue-related performance degradation at the time of the crash. This prediction was supported by the presence of what appeared to be fatigue-related behaviors in the Air Traffic Controller during the 30 min prior to and in the minutes after the crash. Our modeling results do not definitively establish fatigue in the Air Traffic Controller as a cause of the accident, rather they suggest that had he been less fatigued he might have detected Comair Flight 5191's lining up on the wrong runway. We were not able to perform a similar analysis for the Captain and First Officer because we were not able to estimate with confidence their sleep/wake histories. Our estimates of sleep/wake history and circadian rhythm phase for the Air Traffic Controller might generalize to other air traffic controllers and to flight crew operating in the early morning hours at LEX. Relative to other times of day, the modeling results suggest an elevated risk of fatigue-related error, incident, or accident in the early morning due to truncated sleep from the early start and adverse circadian phase from the time of day. This in turn suggests that fatigue mitigation targeted to early morning starts might reduce fatigue risk. In summary, this study suggests that mathematical models predicting performance from sleep/wake history and circadian phase are (1) useful in retrospective accident analysis provided reliable sleep/wake histories are available for the accident personnel and, (2) useful in prospective fatigue-risk identification, mitigation, and accident prevention. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2011,United States,Assessing air medical crew real-time readiness to perform critical tasks,"<title>Assessing air medical crew real-time readiness to perform critical tasks</title> <abstract>Background. Air medical transport has had problems with its safety record, attributed in part to human error. Flight crew members (FCMs) must be able to focus on critical safety tasks in the context of a stressful environment. Flight crew members'™ cognitive readiness (CR) to perform their jobs may be affected by sleep deprivation, personal problems, high workload, and use of alcohol and drugs. Objective. The current study investigated the feasibility of using a computer-based cognitive task to assess FCMs'™ readiness to perform their job. Methods. The FCMs completed a short questionnaire to evaluate their physiologic and psychological state at the beginning and end of each shift. The FCMs then performed 3 minutes of a computer-based cognitive task called synthetic work environment (SYNWIN test battery). Task performance was compared with the questionnaire variables using correlation and regression analysis. Differences between the beginning and end of each shift were matched and compared using a paired Students t test. Results. SYNWIN performance was significantly worse at the end of a shift compared with the beginning of the shift (p = 0.028) primarily because of decrement in the memory component. The SYNWIN composite scores were negatively correlated to degree of irritability felt by the participant, both before (r = -0.25) and after (r = -0.34) a shift and were significantly correlated with amount of sleep (0.22), rest (0.30), and life satisfaction (0.30). Conclusions. Performance by FCMs on a simple, rapid, computer-based psychological test correlates well with self-reported sleep, rest, life satisfaction, and irritability. Although further studies are warranted, these findings suggest that assessment of the performance of FCMs on a simple, rapid, computer-based, multitasking battery is feasible as an approach to determine their readiness to perform critical safety tasks through the SYNWIN task battery. © 2011 National Association of EMS Physicians.</abstract>"

Patients: The case of a single patient with a unilateral intra-vestibular schwannoma. Intervention: Return to a flying status with specific restrictions and under tight conditions depending on the outcomes of a mandatory periodic watch-and-rescan policy. Main Outcome Measures: Consecutive magnetic resonance imaging results coupled to the clinical otovestibular status of the patient. Results: After 16 uneventful months of flying, the pilot was grounded after a first episode of vertigo. Conclusion: The combination of an intravestibular schwannoma-as one of the rarest intralabyrinthine schwannomas-and a pilot-for whom proper otovestibular functioning is of the uppermost importance-challenges the responsibilities of all involved. Depending on the clinical circumstances and under tight conditions with specific restrictions, a return to a flying status can very exceptionally be considered.

This is a cross-sectional survey-based study on the current urine collection device employed in the U.S. Air Force's U-2S airframe, examining effi cacy, problems with wear, device maintenance, and complaint reporting. Methods: An anonymous survey consisting of 18 questions was generated inquiring about problems with wear of the urine collection system, care of the device, and education. The survey was offered at Beale AFB and overseas U-2 locations to pilots with at least 180 h of flying experience with the airframe. Results: There were 57 subjects who completed the survey with 62.5% reporting complications, including mechanical dysfunction, pain and poor fi t, skin irritation, allergic reaction, embarrassment, and urethral issues. Variation was seen in the degree of problem reporting and care of the device. Discussion and literature review is provided on in-flight and space urine collection and evacuation systems, sheath catheters, urine and contact dermatitis, urethritis, external catheter sizing methods, and psychological aspects of catheter use. Conclusions: The majority of surveyed pilots experienced various problems associated with wear of their urine collection device. Also, variation in reporting and care of the device exists. Potential improvements include standardization of fi tting procedures and device maintenance, increased catheter draining capacity, use of skin barriers to urine, enhanced privacy measures, and incorporation of less injurious structural materials such as silicone.

2011,United States,Initial cognitive performance predicts longitudinal aviator performance,"<title>Initial cognitive performance predicts longitudinal aviator performance</title> <abstract>Objectives. The goal of the study was to improve prediction of longitudinal flight simulator performance by studying cognitive factors that may moderate the influence of chronological age. Method. We examined age-related change in aviation performance in aircraft pilots in relation to baseline cognitive ability measures and aviation expertise. Participants were aircraft pilots (N = 276) aged 40-77.9. Flight simulator performance and cognition were tested yearly; there were an average of 4.3 (± 2.7; range 1-13) data points per participant. Each participant was classified into one of the three levels of aviation expertise based on Federal Aviation Administration pilot proficiency ratings: least, moderate, or high expertise. Results. Addition of measures of cognitive processing speed and executive function to a model of age-related change in aviation performance significantly improved the model. Processing speed and executive function performance interacted such that the slowest rate of decline in flight simulator performance was found in aviators with the highest scores on tests of these abilities. Expertise was beneficial to pilots across the age range studied; however, expertise did not show evidence of reducing the effect of age. Discussion. These data suggest that longitudinal performance on an important real-world activity can be predicted by initial assessment of relevant cognitive abilities. © The Author 2011.</abstract>"

Individuals sometimes forget to perform intentions in safety-critical work contexts. Holding intentions can also interfere with ongoing tasks. We applied theories and methods from the experimental literature to test the effectiveness of external aids in reducing prospective memory error and costs to ongoing tasks in an air traffic control simulation. Participants were trained to accept and hand-off aircraft and to detect aircraft conflicts. For the prospective memory task, participants were required to substitute alternative actions for routine actions when accepting target aircraft. Across two experiments, external display aids were provided that presented the details of target aircraft and associated intended actions. We predicted that aids would only be effective if they provided information that was diagnostic of target occurrence, and in this study, we examined the utility of aids that directly cued participants when to allocate attention to the prospective memory task. When aids were set to flash when the prospective memory target aircraft needed to be accepted, prospective memory error and costs to ongoing tasks of aircraft acceptance and conflict detection were reduced. In contrast, aids that did not alert participants specifically when the target aircraft were present provided no advantage compared to when no aids were used. These findings have practical implications for the potential relative utility of automated external aids for occupations where individuals monitor multi-item dynamic displays. © 2011 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"

Information requests were made apparent by eliminating access to standard tower information sources. Instead, controllers were required to ask for precisely the information they needed during the scenarios. The information requests were classified using an elaboration of Zwaan and Radvansky's (1998) dimensions of situation models. The vast majority of requests were about three of the dimensions originally developed for reading comprehension: the protagonist, intentionality, and space. The information requests were also classified into 28 operational categories (e.g., aircraft identification, destination). From these results, the data were summarized, not just statistically, but by the creation of display-hypotheses. The display-hypotheses were organized according to the situation-model dimensions. Controllers preferred data blocks organized by the situation-model principle over those that violated this organization. The summary display-hypotheses were quite simple and accounted for the vast majority of the information requests controllers made. The display-hypotheses accounted for the information needs of controllers during routine as well as off-nominal events. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"

Methods: Clinically evaluated U.S. Naval aviators and flight officers {N = 954) disposed as either aeronautically adaptable (AA) or not aeronautically adaptable (NAA) were compared with respect to their facet level scores on the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO Pl-R). Additional analyses were conducted to control for NAA status attributable to physical as opposed to psychological standards and for student versus designated aviator/flight officer experience levels. Results: NAA aviators and flight officers, when compared to their AA counterparts, evidenced significant and substantive effect size differences on facets measuring negative emotionality, interpersonal effectiveness, and goal-orientation. Conclusion: FFM facet differences between AA and NAA officers were only partially consistent with U.S. Navy guidelines; expected facet differences related to compliance, deliberation, actions, and excitement-seeking/impulsivity were not observed.

Methods A questionnaire about psychosocial work environment and symptoms was answered by 918 (82%) flight attendants, stewards, and pursers at one airline company in 2005. Adjustment was made for age, gender, smoking, job category, and flight length using multiple logistic regression. Results Weekly headaches, concentration difficulties, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms were reported at rates of 18%, 10%, 56%, and 13%, respectively. Pursers scored higheron control than the others and they had lower associations between the strain measured by the demands-control model and symptoms than stewards and flight attendants. All symptoms were more common in the high strain situation than in the low strain (reference). An active situation was related to an excess of symptoms. Low social support in the iso-strain model increased risk of symptoms. Conclusions Demands-control and iso-strain models are useful in studying stressrelated symptoms in cabin crews.

They also provide an overview of the basic principles and practices of one such program known as Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM). Successful peer support programs, modeled on the principles of CISM, have been instituted in employee classifications within the high-risk aviation field. Aviation is a high-risk organization because employees experience considerable physical and psychological threats in their work. A CISM program now serves air traffic controllers, pilots, flight attendants, and ground personnel. The article presents the basic elements of peer support teams serving high-risk organizations. Aviation is also a High Reliability Organization (HRO); an organization expected to function consistently and safely. Organized and well-trained CISM teams can help a high risk/high reliability organization become a high resiliency organization.

2010,United States,Transitioning to future air traffic management: Effects of imperfect automation on controller attention and performance,"<title>Transitioning to future air traffic management: Effects of imperfect automation on controller attention and performance</title> <abstract>Objective: This study examined whether benefits of conflict probe automation would occur in a future air traffic scenario in which air traffic service providers (ATSPs) are not directly responsible for freely maneuvering aircraft but are controlling other nonequipped aircraft (mixed-equipage environment). The objective was to examine how the type of automation imperfection (miss vs. false alarm) affects ATSP performance and attention allocation. Background: Research has shown that the type of automation imperfection leads to differential human performance costs. Method: Participating in four 30-min scenarios were 12 full-performance-level ATSPs. Dependent variables included conflict detection and resolution performance, eye movements, and subjective ratings of trust and self confidence. Results: ATSPs detected conflicts faster and more accurately with reliable automation, as compared with manual performance. When the conflict probe automation was unreliable, conflict detection performance declined with both miss (25% conflicts detected) and false alarm automation (50% conflicts detected). Conclusion: When the primary task of conflict detection was automated, even highly reliable yet imperfect automation (miss or false alarm) resulted in serious negative effects on operator performance. Application: The further in advance that conflict probe automation predicts a conflict, the greater the uncertainty of prediction; thus, designers should provide users with feedback on the state of the automation or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of the data underlying the conflict probe algorithm. © 2010, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2010,Australia,Prospective Memory and Task Interference in a Continuous Monitoring Dynamic Display Task,"<title>Prospective Memory and Task Interference in a Continuous Monitoring Dynamic Display Task</title> <abstract>Theories and methods from the prospective memory literature were used to anticipate how individuals would maintain and retrieve intentions in a continuous monitoring dynamic display task. Participants accepted aircraft into sectors and detected aircraft conflicts during an air traffic control simulation. They were sometimes required to substitute new actions for routine actions when accepting aircraft traveling at certain speeds or altitudes, or with certain call signs. In Experiment 1, prospective memory error increased with intent to deviate from strong compared to weak routine, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to speed intentions. In addition, errors increased when intentions were general compared to specific. Participants also missed more conflicts when deviating from strong compared to weak routine. In Experiment 2, errors increased for intentions nonfocal to ongoing tasks compared to focal, and this effect was larger for altitude intentions compared to call sign intentions. Participants were slower to accept aircraft when holding nonfocal compared to focal intentions, and slower to accept aircraft and detect conflicts when holding focal intentions compared to no intentions. These findings are consistent with theories that assume that individuals allocate limited-capacity attentional resources to prospective memory tasks. Increased error for altitude intentions, together with the effect of routine strength, suggest a vulnerability to error with increased strength of association between prospective memory cues and competing ongoing tasks. Ongoing tasks that focus attention on cues may sometimes impair, rather than benefit, intention retrieval. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2010,United States,Panic disorder in military aviators: A retrospective study of prevalence,"<title>Panic disorder in military aviators: A retrospective study of prevalence</title> <abstract>Introduction: The occurrence of panic disorder (PD) among military pilots and navigators poses questions with respect to medical care and waiver policy, but the prevalence of such disorders is unclear. We studied the epidemiology of PD in a USAF aircrew population. Methods: Occurrence of PD during the period 2001-2008 was determined using the USAF Aeromedical Information Management Waiver Tracking System, a database containing medical disqualifications and waivers for the entire population of both qualified and disqualified (grounded) USAF aviators. Results: The mean annual USAF pilot and navigator population averaged 17,727 during the study period. The database yielded nine cases labeled as PD. After records review by two experienced aeromedical psychiatrists, only three of the nine cases met diagnostic criteria for PD. Estimated annual PD prevalence was 0.002% (2/100,000) in USAF pilots and navigators. Annual prevalence of PD was 2.7% in the general U.S. population 18 yr of age and older and 2.4% in a group of manager/professionals. Odds ratios were 1228 (55/27,269) and 1089 (49/24,175) for the general population and manager/professionals, respectively. Discussion: One of three individuals with PD received a waiver to resume flying after successful treatment. Five of the six cases not meeting criteria for PD (but suffering from varying degrees of situational and/or stress related anxiety) were flying with waivers. The negligible annual PD prevalence in USAF pilots and navigators likely reflects lower aircrew vulnerability to PD because of selection and training processes and does not pose a disease burden upon force strength. © by the Aerospace Medical Association,.</abstract>"
2010,India,Psychosocial factors that influence recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities,"<title>Psychosocial factors that influence recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities</title> <abstract>STUDY DESIGN.: Descriptive questionnaire study. OBJECTIVE.: This preliminary study was undertaken to try and develop an understanding of the factors that may affect recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Clinical recovery from musculoskeletal disabilities is generally achieved after the patient undergoes definitive therapy and rehabilitation. However, a proportion of patients may continue to suffer from morbidity and pain long after clinical and radiological finality has been reached. In these cases, psychosocial factors may have played a contributory role. There has been no research documenting or studying such factors in aviation and pilots in particular. METHODS.: The study was carried out at the Department of Human Engineering from 2004 to 2006. A detailed questionnaire was designed to elicit basic clinical details and psychosocial factors at work and home. RESULTS.: A total of 57 male aircrew participated voluntarily in this study. Of these, 41 (71.9%) achieved normal recovery, whereas in the remaining 16 (28.1%), recovery was considered delayed. The mean age of aircrew in the normal recovery group (33.1 ± 4.6 years) was slightly higher than those in the delayed group (31.0 ± 3.2 years). All the aircrew who had delayed recovery had a spinal disability, whereas spinal disabilities constituted only 46.3% in the normal recovery group. Of the spinal disabilities in aircrew with delayed recovery, 12 had low backache. Aircraft accidents and ejection accounted for almost one-fifth of the total disabilities (n = 11, 21.9%). The respondents identified multiple sources of emotional support viz., friends, family, and parents. CONCLUSION.: A hypothetical model is proposed that possibly explains to some extent the role of psychosocial factors affecting recovery in aircrew with musculoskeletal disabilities. Further research in psychological and emotional consequences of trauma, in particular ejection and the best means/timings to address these, is recommended. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.</abstract>"
2010,Spain,Can we predict risk-taking behavior? Two behavioral tests for predicting guessing tendencies in a multiple-choice test,"<title>Can we predict risk-taking behavior? Two behavioral tests for predicting guessing tendencies in a multiple-choice test</title> <abstract>Objective behavioral personality measures are an alternative to traditional self-report personality assessment and overcome some of the difficulties traditional assessment has. This paper presents two studies to validate two measures of risk propensity. In Study 1, 1,325 applicants for an ab initio air-traffic control training program were assessed using the Roulette Test (RT) and the Crossing the Street Test (CtST). Convergent as well as criterion validity were tested using the guessing tendency demonstrated by participants in a multiple-choice test. Once the effect of general cognitive ability was leveled out, results showed the predictive capacity of both tests. Study 2 replicated the previous study: 127 3rd-year psychology students were assessed using the RT. Results showed that the test had an even higher predictive validity of the Guessing Tendency (GT) revealed in a multiple-choice test. The usefulness for personnel recruitment processes and other assessment contexts is emphasized as are future trends of objective personality assessment. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

2010,United States,Airline pilots' knowledge and beliefs about over-the-counter medications,"<title>Airline pilots' knowledge and beliefs about over-the-counter medications</title> <abstract>Introduction: Toxicological studies of accident pilots frequently find the presence of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. While many of these drugs are approved for use while flying, others are not. To better understand how pilots come to use unapproved OTC drugs, this study explored psychological and behavioral factors that might influence pilots' decisions about using OTC drug products. Methods: There were 216 working airline pilots who completed a survey that probed their 1) attitudes toward taking medications; 2) knowledge of OTC medications and the pilot-specific rules that govern their usage; 3) perceived pressures in the work environment; and 4) use of available information about OTC medications. Results: The results characterize pilots as workers who are often highly motivated to consider the use of OTC medications, but who lack the knowledge, available information, and information-seeking habits to make informed decisions about OTC drug usage under the more complicated constraints of a safety-critical job. Discussion: Rather than attempt to diminish the perceived appeal of OTC medications in the minds of pilots, we argue that pilots must be provided with additional guidance when making decisions about OTC drug usage.

Specifically, it describes the proposed concept for a unique report, which will form the basis for all operational and safety reports completed by flight crew. This includes all mandatory and optional reports. Critically, this form is central to the advancement of improved processes and technology tools, supporting airline performance management, safety management, organisational learning and knowledge integration/information-sharing activities. Specifically, this paper describes the background to the development of this reporting form, the logic and contents of this form and how reporting data will be made use of by airline personnel. This includes a description of the proposed intelligent planning process and the associated intelligent flight plan concept, which makes use of airline operational and safety analyses information. Primarily, this new reporting form has been developed in collaboration with a major Spanish airline. In addition, it has involved research with five other airlines. Overall, this has involved extensive field research, collaborative prototyping and evaluation of new reports/flight plan concepts and a number of evaluation activities. Participants have included both operational and management personnel, across different airline flight operations processes. Statement of Relevance: This paper presents the development of a reporting concept outlined through field research and collaborative prototyping within an airline. The resulting reporting function, embedded in the journey log compiled at the end of each flight, aims at enabling employees to audit the operations of the company they work for. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"
2010,United States,Hybrid system model of air traffic controller cognition,"<title>Hybrid system model of air traffic controller cognition</title> <abstract>Increased automation in air traffic control has many benefits, but to incorporate advanced automation tools safely and effectively requires careful analysis of their impact on human controllers. The literature on cognitive psychology and human factors has produced many qualitative models that describe the cognitive processes of controllers as well as a variety of computational models that attempt to reproduce the way controllers make decisions. The work presented here uses these results to form a novel hybrid system framework for modeling human cognition and describes a model of air traffic controller cognition based on this framework. The thought process is modeled as a set of critical variables that represent the human controller's picture of a given air traffic situation, with the evolution of these variables described by a set of hybrid dynamics where the discrete variables correspond to different thought processes and cognitive tasks. The primary contribution of this paper is to place the cognitive model within the formal mathematical framework of hybrid systems theory, allowing verification and online estimation and control with the tools of hybrid systems.</abstract>"

There is an increasing interest in studying the influence of emotions and its role as psychosocial factors in the work environment as they are able to act as facilitators or shock absorbers. The contrast of the theoretical models by using traditional parametric techniques requires a large sample size to the efficient estimation of the coefficients that quantify the relations between variables. Since the available sample that we have is small, the most common size in European enterprises, we used the maximum entropy principle to explore the emotions that are involved in the psychosocial risks. The analyses show that this method takes advantage of the limited information available and guarantee an optimal estimation, the results of which are coherent with theoretical models and numerous empirical researches about emotions and well-being.

Flight attendants who were light to heavy smokers rated their craving to smoke at predetermined time points during a 2-way short flight (each leg 3-5.5 hr) and a 1-way long flight (8-13 hr). In both short and long flights, craving increased gradually and peaked as landing approached. Craving levels at the end of the 1st leg of the short flights were equal to those at the end of the long flight and were much higher than those at the parallel time point in the long flight. In the short flight, craving levels at the beginning of the 2nd leg dropped relative to the end of the 1st leg, both for participants who smoked during the intermission and for those who did not, though the drop was steeper for the former. The results provide additional evidence for the role of psychological factors in determining the craving to smoke in a naturalistic setting. © 2010 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"

Based on a task analysis of ATM and backed up by the stress-strain model, an easy-to-interpret triangle was constructed and validated both in simulated and real ATM workplaces. Results from the validation studies show that TEST does not only reflect the most relevant task characteristics, but also provides additional insights in the controllers' working styles. The TEST tool can make ATM safety surveys more efficient and help supervisors to decide about optimal times for opening or closing additional sectors. Statement of Relevance: TEST is a new tool to assess taskload, efficiency and safety-buffers in a joint scaling. It reflects increases in taskload and effects of taskload on safety-buffers and efficiency, as well as trade-offs in opposite directions. This tool might be very useful to check sector capacity in ATM and other high risk environments. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Latent growth modeling for logistic response functions,"<title>Latent growth modeling for logistic response functions</title> <abstract>Throughout much of the social and behavioral sciences, latent growth modeling (latent curve analysis) has become an important tool for understanding individuals' longitudinal change. Although nonlinear variations of latent growth models appear in the methodological and applied literature, a notable exclusion is the treatment of growth following logistic (sigmoidal; S-shape) response functions. Such trajectories are assumed in a variety of psychological and educational settings where learning occurs over time, and yet applications using the logistic model in growth modeling methodology have been sparse. The logistic function, in particular, may not be utilized as often because software options remain limited. In this article we show how a specialized version of the logistic function can be modeled using conventional structural equation modeling software. The specialization is a reparameterization of the logistic function whose new parameters correspond to scientifically interesting characteristics of the growth process. In addition to providing an example using simulated data, we show how this nonlinear functional form can be fit using transformed subject-level data obtained through a learning task from an air traffic controller simulation experiment. LISREL syntax for the empirical example is provided. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,Australia,Predicting pilots risk-taking behavior through an implicit association test,"<title>Predicting pilots risk-taking behavior through an implicit association test</title> <abstract>Objective: The Implicit Association Test (IAT), in combination with a battery of additional psychometric tests, was employed to examine the accuracy with which it predicts pilots risk-taking behavior. Background: Risk management is an integral part of piloting. Many factors affect pilots risk management, including individual differences. Therefore, employing a unique methodology from social cognition, the present study examined the influence of attitude, as measured implicitly through the IAT, personality, and flight experience variables on pilots risk-taking behavior. Method: In addition to a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator, 35 pilots completed a battery of psychometric tests. Results: Among the 6 risk perception variables, 10 risk attitude variables, and 2 experience variables, only 2 variables were found to be significantly related with in-flight risk-taking behavior: everyday risk (risk perception) and the IAT effect (attitude). Of these, the IAT effect was the strongest predictor of flight behavior. Conclusion: The results indicate that implicit attitudinal measures, such as the IAT, provide a more accurate forecast of pilot behavior than do the more traditional explicit attitudinal or personality measures. Application: An implicit attitudinal measure can be proactively employed to identify pilots who are potentially more likely to engage in high-risk activities, hence permitting a more strategic approach to pilot training. © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Critical action procedures testing: A novel method for test-enhanced learning,"<title>Critical action procedures testing: A novel method for test-enhanced learning</title> <abstract>Context: Human error is a leading cause of adverse events in anaesthesia. Residents' knowledge of how to respond to rare, yet potentially life-threatening events has been shown to deteriorate over time and thus cost-effective educational interventions are indicated. Previous research has shown that test-enhanced learning has the potential to strengthen both clinical knowledge and performance. We hypothesised that critical action procedures (CAPs) tests, similar to those employed by high-performance aircraft pilots, would help improve resident knowledge about how to respond to rare and potentially catastrophic events encountered during the perioperative period. Methods: Knowledge assessments were administered to 29 first-year anaesthesiology residents over the course of 9 months. Five-minute closed-book tests were administered with fill-in-the-blank questions regarding the American Society of Anesthesiologists' difficult airway guideline, advanced cardiac life support protocols, an institutional airway fire protocol and drug dosing for malignant hyperthermia. Inter-group comparisons were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The difference between the pre-test and final test scores for each subsection was determined with the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples. Results: Composite subtest scores, when compared with baseline pre-test scores and subsequent scores, and when adjusted for attrition, significantly improved over the course of 9 months (20.5% versus 80%; P ≤ 0.001). Likert-based survey data indicated a positive report for attainment of knowledge. Conclusions: In this longitudinal observational study of first-year anaesthesiology residents, CAPs testing helped improve knowledge about critical events. Although the study was limited by its small number of subjects, a significant attrition rate and the lack of a control group, it demonstrates a cost-effective educational intervention that improved resident knowledge. This intervention may enable residents to transfer learned skills from theoretical testing situations to real-life scenarios. We propose the use and further study of CAPs testing as a cost-effective modality to augment both simulated and actual experiential learning. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009.</abstract>"
2009,,The king LT versus the combitube: Flight crew performance and preference,"<title>The king LT versus the combitube: Flight crew performance and preference</title> <abstract>Introduction. Air medical personnel frequently face the challenge of the emergency airway. The Combitube is an airway device commonly used by emergency medical services (EMS) providers as either a primary or rescue airway. Objective. We sought to evaluate the performance and preference of air medical personnel using a newer laryngeal tube airway device, the King LT, versus the Combitube in a simulator model. Methods. Participants included flight physicians, nurses, and paramedics in our air medical transport program. Twenty-seven subjects participated. Participants received a 10-minute instructional program, and then had individual practice with each device. Participants were tested on the insertion of each device in a Laerdal SimMan. Rates of successful placement, time to successful placement, and practitioner preference were recorded. Perceived ease of insertion was measured on a five-point scale (1 easy, 5 difficult). Results. All 27 participants correctly placed each device. Mean time to placement was 24.4 seconds (standard deviation [SD] of 4.7 seconds) for the King LT and 37.9 seconds (SD of 5.9 seconds) for the Combitube. The difference in mean times was 13.5 seconds (p < 0.0001). For the participants' perceived ease of insertion, the mean score for the King LT was 1.3 and that for the Combitube was 2.5. Twenty-six of 27 participants preferred the King LT over the Combitube. Conclusions. The King LT was placed significantly faster than the Combitube and was also perceived as easier to place. Ninety-six percent of the participants preferred the King LT. Limitations include using a simulator model rather than a human model. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.</abstract>"
2009,Finland,Heart rate variability and stress hormones in novice and experienced parachutists anticipating a jump,"<title>Heart rate variability and stress hormones in novice and experienced parachutists anticipating a jump</title> <abstract>Introduction: Chronic work stress and overtraining are known to influence heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and decreased nocturnal HRV is associated with cardiovascular health and disease. The purpose of this study was to examine whether anticipation of an acute highly stressful event influences HR and HRV during the night and morning. Methods: Nocturnal HR and HRV and urinary stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline) as well as HR and HRV responses to an orthostatic test on the morning of a parachute jump day or control day were analyzed from 14 novice and 7 experienced parachute jumpers. Results: There were no differences in any HRV indices during the night or the orthostatic test between the jump and control situations. The novices had higher HR than experienced jumpers in the orthostatic test in the morning and also during the jump, but no differences were found between the groups in nocturnal HR and HRV indices or HRV indices during the orthostatic test. There were no differences in nocturnal stress hormone secretions except slightly elevated adrenaline secretion during the jump night compared to the control night (P = 0.014). Conclusions: The parachute jump did not substantially influence HR, HRV, or stress hormones during the night or the orthostatic test in the morning preceding the jump. The results suggest that the parachute jump as an acute highly stressful event had no anticipatory effect on autonomic modulation of the heart even though both the novices and experienced jumpers had markedly accentuated sympathetic activation during the parachuting.

2009,France,Information seeking in documents by pilots: Assessment of the reliability problems caused by the transition from paper to electronic,"<title>Information seeking in documents by pilots: Assessment of the reliability problems caused by the transition from paper to electronic</title> <abstract>Information seeking is completely ignored in research on aviation psychology and more generally in issues of air transport safety. But information seeking occupies a central place in the pilots' work. And this activity is undergoing an important development: the transition from paper to electronic documents. A contribution to the assessment of this transition is presented here. The assessment is focused on deterioration of information access, understanding and exploitation, and their possible negative consequences in terms of reliability. The exploitation of the documentation by pilots, and particularly the information seeking activity, are described and linked to their contexts (i.e. the main tasks of flying that require information seeking). Then an users test is presented where some information-seeking tasks are evaluated in terms of cost and errors, by comparing electronic and paper documents. The results show that electronic documents provide new functions that seem useful but also that too many new functions generate difficulties. Then it seems that pilots need some time to learn how to use these new documents. Reducing attention needed to perform a task such as calculation is risky. Some aspects of information seeking by the pilots should be better analysed and evaluated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Adaptive allocation of attentional gain,"<title>Adaptive allocation of attentional gain</title> <abstract>Humans are adept at distinguishing between stimuli that are very similar, an ability that is particularly crucial when the outcome is of serious consequence (e.g., for a surgeon or air-traffic controller). Traditionally, selective attention was thought to facilitate perception by increasing the gain of sensory neurons tuned to the defining features of a behaviorally relevant object (e.g., color, orientation, etc.). In contrast, recent mathematical models counterintuitively suggest that, in many cases, attentional gain should be applied to neurons that are tuned away from relevant features, especially when discriminating highly similar stimuli. Here we used psychophysical methods to critically evaluate these ""ideal observer"" models. The data demonstrate that attention enhances the gain of the most informative sensory neurons, even when these neurons are tuned away from the behaviorally relevant target feature. Moreover, the degree to which an individual adopted optimal attentional gain settings by the end of testing predicted success rates on a difficult visual discrimination task, as well as the amount of task improvement that occurred across repeated testing sessions (learning). Contrary to most traditional accounts, these observations suggest that the primary function of attentional gain is not to enhance the representation of target features per se, but instead to optimize performance on the current perceptual task. Additionally, individual differences in gain suggest that the operating characteristics of low-level attentional phenomena are not stable trait-like attributes and that variability in how attention is deployed may play an important role in determining perceptual abilities.

2009,France,Heart rate and autonomic balance during stand tests before and after fighter combat missions,"<title>Heart rate and autonomic balance during stand tests before and after fighter combat missions</title> <abstract>Background: High workload during combat missions is a critical factor in the use of modern aircraft. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of piloting in war zones on the kinetics of the sympathovagal balance during recovery. Methods: There were 40 military pilots who were monitored during operational flights in Afghanistan. Electrocardiographic activity was recorded during stand tests performed 1 h before takeoff (T-1), immediately after landing (L+0), 2 h after (L+2), and 4 h after (L+4) the flight. Missions were divided in two groups according to flight duration. Results: The mean length of long flights was 4:31 ± 0:53 h and of short flights 1:27 ± 0:09 h. For long flights, at L+0, all indices related to parasympathetic modulation rose significantly in comparison to T-1, L+2, and L+4 (total power L+0: 2083 ± 414 ms 2·Hz -1, T-1: 1269 ± 158 ms 2·Hz -1, L+2:1095 ± 148 ms 2·Hz -1, and L+4: 1238 ± 124 ms 2·Hz -1; high-frequency normalized units (HFnu)L+0: 16 ± 2%, T-1: 11 ± 1%, L+2: 10 ± 1%, and L+4: 11 ± 1%). At the same time the sympathetic frequency components significantly decreased (low-frequency normalized units (LFnu) L+0: 83 ± 2%, T-1: 88 ± 1%, L+2: 90 ± 1%, and L+4: 89 ± 1%; LF/HF L+0: 7 ± 1, T-1: 11 ± 1, L+2: 13 ± 2, and L+4: 16 ± 3). For short flights, the sympathetic components were higher at L+0 (LFnu: 77 ± 2%; LF/HF: 14 ± 3) than at T-1 (LFnu: 66 ± 5%; LF/HF: 6 ± 1). A concomitant reduction of vagal components was observed. Conclusions: Modulations of autonomic balance differed with the type of mission. A postflight sympathetic increase represents an autonomic adaptation due to stress and flight. A raise of parasympathetic modulation after flight may be related to the decrease of alertness. Copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"

2009,United States,"False alerts in air traffic control conflict alerting system: Is there a ""cry wolf"" effect?","<title>False alerts in air traffic control conflict alerting system: Is there a ""cry wolf"" effect?</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim is to establish the extent to which the high false-alarm rate of air traffic control midair conflict alerts is responsible for a ""cry wolf"" effect-where true alerts are not responded to and all alerts are delayed in their response. Background: Some aircraft collisions have been partly attributed to the cry wolf effect, and in other domains (health care and systems monitoring), there is a causal connection between false-alarm rate and cry wolf behavior. We hypothesized that a corresponding relationship exists in air traffic control (ATC). Method: Aircraft track and alert system behavior data surrounding 495 conflict alerts were analyzed to identify true and false alerts, trajectory type, and controller behavior. Forty-five percent of the alerts were false, ranging from 0.28 to 0.58. Results: Although centers with more false alerts contributed to more nonresponses, there was no evidence that these were nonresponses to true alerts or that response times were delayed in those centers. Instead, controllers showed desirable anticipatory behavior by issuing trajectory changes prior to the alert. Those trajectory pairs whose conflicts were more difficult to visualize induced more reliance on, and less compliance with, the alerting system. Conclusion: The high false-alarm rate does not appear to induce cry wolf behavior in the context of en route ATC conflict alerts. Application: There is no need to substantially modify conflict alert algorithms, but the conflict alert system may be modified to address difficult-to-visualize conflicts.

Any misadventure in either of their working worlds can lead to death. Yet the pathways to certification and implicit attitudes toward training are quite different in these 2 disciplines and provide an opportunity to compare and contrast the methodologies employed. At the 5th annual Innovations in the Surgical Environments Conference, senior and junior aviators and surgeons shared their experiences from the perspective of trainee and trainer and in the process presented an interesting study in parallels and contrasts. The US Navy follows a highly regimented training syllabus with graduated levels of responsibility designed to create the safest possible flying environment. Extensive preflight and postflight effort is required for each mission flown. Surgical training is also hierarchal in responsibility, but graduates demonstrate greater variability in their training experience. The surgical field can only fortify its emphasis on safety by seeking to provide the optimal training experiences necessary in the high-stakes environment of the operating theater. In doing so, surgeons may find reinvigorated commitment through study of the aviation industry's established methods of training and practice. © 2009 Sage Publications.</abstract>"

2009,Germany,Cultural differences in dealing with critical incidents,"<title>Cultural differences in dealing with critical incidents</title> <abstract>This article discusses the cultural aspects of High Reliability Organizations (HROs), such as air navigation services. HROs must maintain a highly professional safety culture and constantly be prepared to handle crises. The article begins with a general discussion of the concept of organizational culture. The special characteristics of HROs and their safety culture is then described. Finally the article illustrates how Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) is becoming an ingrained feature of the organizational culture in air traffic control systems. Critical Incident Stress Management is a prevention program that can successfully guard against the negative effects of critical incidents. The CISM program of DFS (Deutsche Flugsicherung) was recently evaluated by the University of Copenhagen. This evaluation not only confirmed the successful prevention of negative effects at the operation's employee level (especially air traffic controllers), but also showed a sustained improvement of its safety culture and its overall organizational performance. The special aspects of cross-cultural crisis intervention and the challenges it faces, as well as the importance of prevention programs, such as CISM, are illustrated using the examples of two aircraft accidents: the crash landing of a calibration aircraft and the Lake Constance air disaster. © 2009 Chevron Publishing.</abstract>"
2009,Australia,A Theory and Model of Conflict Detection in Air Traffic Control: Incorporating Environmental Constraints,"<title>A Theory and Model of Conflict Detection in Air Traffic Control: Incorporating Environmental Constraints</title> <abstract>A performance theory for conflict detection in air traffic control is presented that specifies how controllers adapt decisions to compensate for environmental constraints. This theory is then used as a framework for a model that can fit controller intervention decisions. The performance theory proposes that controllers apply safety margins to ensure separation between aircraft. These safety margins are formed through experience and reflect the biasing of decisions to favor safety over accuracy, as well as expectations regarding uncertainty in aircraft trajectory. In 2 experiments, controllers indicated whether they would intervene to ensure separation between pairs of aircraft. The model closely predicted the probability of controller intervention across the geometry of problems and as a function of controller experience. When controller safety margins were manipulated via task instructions, the parameters of the model changed in the predicted direction. The strength of the model over existing and alternative models is that it better captures the uncertainty and decision biases involved in the process of conflict detection. © 2009 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2009,Australia - United States,Goal Orientations and Performance: Differential Relationships Across Levels of Analysis and as a Function of Task Demands,"<title>Goal Orientations and Performance: Differential Relationships Across Levels of Analysis and as a Function of Task Demands</title> <abstract>Goal orientation and self-regulation theories were integrated to develop a multilevel framework aimed at addressing controversies regarding the magnitude and direction of goal orientation effects on performance. In Study 1, goal orientations were measured repeatedly whilst individuals performed an air traffic control task. In Study 2, goal orientations and exam performance were measured across 3 time points while undergraduates completed a course. Mastery-approach orientation was positively related to performance at the intraindividual level, but not at the interindividual level, and its effect was not moderated by task demands. Performance-approach positively predicted performance at the interindividual level, and at the intraindividual level, the direction of its effect switched as a function of task demands. Performance-avoid negatively predicted performance at the interindividual level but did not emerge as an intraindividual predictor. Mastery-avoid did not relate to performance at either level of analysis. This consistent pattern across 2 studies suggests that levels of analysis and task demands can determine the magnitude and direction of goal orientation effects on performance and highlights avenues for theory development. © 2009 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2009,Germany,Workload during approaches: Comparison of simulated standard and noise-abatement profiles,"<title>Workload during approaches: Comparison of simulated standard and noise-abatement profiles</title> <abstract>duction: A new noise-reduced landing approach was tested-a Segmented Continuous Descent Approach (SCDA)-with regard to the resulting workload on pilots. Methods: Workload of 40 pilots was measured using physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blink frequency, saliva Cortisol concentration) and psychological (fatigue, sleepiness, tension, and task load) parameters. Approaches were conducted in A320 and A330 full-flight simulators during night shift. SCDA was compared to the standard Low Drag Low Power (LDLP) procedure as reference. Results: Mean heart rate and blood pressure during the SCDA were not elevated, but were partly, even significantly, reduced (on average by 5 bpm and 4 mmHg from the flying captain). Cortisol levels did not change significantly with mean values of 0.9 to 1.2 ng • ml-1. Landing was the most demanding segment of both approaches as indicated by significant increases in heart rate and decreases in blink frequency. Subjective task load was low. Discussion: Both approach procedures caused a similar workload level. Interpreting the results, methodological limitations have to be considered, e.g., the artificial and controlled airspace situation in the flight simulator. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that under these ideal conditions, the SCDA is operable without a higher workload for pilots compared to the common LDLP.

2009,"Korea, Republic of - United States",Effects of air transportation cause physiological and biochemical changes indicative of stress leading to regulation of chaperone expression levels and corticosterone concentration,"<title>Effects of air transportation cause physiological and biochemical changes indicative of stress leading to regulation of chaperone expression levels and corticosterone concentration</title> <abstract>Laboratory animals generally experience numerous unfamiliar environmental and psychological influences such as noises, temperatures, handling, shaking, and smells during the process of air transportation. To investigate whether stress induced by air transportation affects stress-related factors in animals, the levels of hormone and chaperone protein were measured in several tissues of F344 rats transported for 13 h and not transported. Herein, we conclude that the levels of corticosterone, HSP70, and GRP78 were significantly increased in the transported group compare to not transported group, but they were rapidly restored to the not transported group level after a recovery period of one week. However, the magnitude of induction and restoration levels of these factors varied depending on the tissue type. Thus, these results suggest that air transportation should be considered for the improvement of laboratory animal health and to reduce the incidence of laboratory animal stress.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Experience-Based Mitigation of Age-Related Performance Declines: Evidence From Air Traffic Control,"<title>Experience-Based Mitigation of Age-Related Performance Declines: Evidence From Air Traffic Control</title> <abstract>Previous research has found age-related deficits in a variety of cognitive processes. However, some studies have demonstrated age-related sparing on tasks where individuals have substantial experience, often attained over many decades. Here, the authors examined whether decades of experience in a fast-paced demanding profession, air traffic control (ATC), would enable older controllers to perform at high levels of proficiency. The authors also investigated whether older controllers would show diminished age-related decrements on domain-relevant cognitive abilities. Both young and old controllers and noncontrollers performed a battery of cognitive and ATC tasks. Results indicate that although high levels of experience can reduce the magnitude of age-related decline on the component processes that underlie complex task performance, this sparing is limited in scope. More important, however, the authors observed experience-based sparing on simulated ATC tasks, with the sparing being most evident on the more complex air traffic control tasks. These results suggest that given substantial experience, older adults may be quite capable of performing at high levels of proficiency on fast-paced demanding real-world tasks. The implications of these findings for global skilled labor shortages are discussed. © 2009 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2009,United Kingdom,"Emotional labour and strain in ""front-line"" service employees: Does mode of delivery matter?","<title>Emotional labour and strain in ""front-line"" service employees: Does mode of delivery matter?</title> <abstract>Purpose - Research suggests that ""front-line"" service jobs typically require emotional labour owing to the high levels of interpersonal interaction inherent in such work. Although emotional labour can be performed face-to-face (in person) or voice-to-voice (on the telephone), little is known about whether the type of emotional demands and the relationships with strain outcomes differ according to mode of delivery. The purpose of this paper is to research these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Relationships are assessed between three dimensions of emotional labour (emotional display rules, and the faking and suppression of emotions) and strain outcomes (psychological distress, work-life conflict and job satisfaction) in a sample of 124-cabin crew (face-to-face interaction) and 122 telesales agents (voice-to-voice interaction). The emotional labour dimensions that are significant predictors of strain outcomes for both groups are examined by multiple regression. Findings - No significant differences were observed between groups in mean levels of emotional labour variables. A greater proportion of variance in all types of strain was explained by the emotional labour components for participants who interact with customers face-to-face but these differences did not reach statistical significance. The emotional labour dimensions that predicted each strain outcome varied according to mode of delivery. Practical implications - Ways by which service sector organisations might counteract the potentially negative effects of performing emotional labour are discussed. Originality/value - The study provides some initial evidence that the impact of mode of delivery in emotion work is worthy of further investigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Status of cardiovascular issues related to space flight: Implications for future research directions,"<title>Status of cardiovascular issues related to space flight: Implications for future research directions</title> <abstract>Compromised cardiovascular performance, occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac atrophy, orthostatic intolerance, reduced aerobic capacity, operational impacts of regular physical exercise, and space radiation are risks of space flight to the cardiovascular system identified in the 2007 NASA Human Integrated Research Program. An evidence-based approach to identify the research priorities needed to resolve those cardiovascular risks that could most likely compromise the successful completion of extended-duration space missions is presented. Based on data obtained fromastronauts who have flown in space, there is no compelling experimental evidence to support significant occurrence of autonomic or vascular dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmias, or manifestation of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease. The operational impact of prolonged daily exercise and space radiation needs to be defined. In contrast, data from the literature support the notion that the highest probability of occurrence and operational impact with space flight involving cardiovascular risks to astronaut health, safety and operational performance are reduced orthostatic tolerance and aerobic capacity, the resource cost of effective countermeasures, and the potential effects of space radiation. Future research should focus on these challenges.</abstract>"
2009,"Taiwan, Province of China",An exploration of quality of life and related factors among female flight attendants,"<title>An exploration of quality of life and related factors among female flight attendants</title> <abstract>Background: Quality of life is currently an important issue in the medical industry. Many studies have found that shift work affects health and life quality. However, data on quality of life related to female flight attendants are lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore quality of life and related factors such as demographic data, work status, fatigue, sleep quality, and family function as they relate to female flight attendants working on international routes. Method: The study used a cross-sectional research design. A purposive sample of 207 participants was recruited from the Aviation Medical Center. The questionnaire distributed to participants incorporated the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue, the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Family Apgar Index, and the Taiwanese version of the WHOQOL-BREF. Results: The mean score for holistic quality of life among participants was 54.49 (SD = 6.48), which ranks at a high-intermediate level. The physical health domain earned the highest mean score and the psychological domain earned the lowest. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analysis using the enter method showed that eight predictors, including religion, drug use, employment status, job stress, job passion, fatigue, sleep quality, and family function, explained 34.2% of variance in holistic quality of life. After controlling for demographics, analysis showed that three variables-fatigue, sleep quality, and family function-accounted for 21.3% of variance in holistic quality of life. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Healthcare providers should consider fatigue, sleep quality, and family function factors when planning related health promotion and disease prevention programs for female flight attendants in the future. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.</abstract>"

2009,Italy,"Monitoring antioxidant defenses and free radical production in space-flight, aviation and railway engine operators, for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, immunological impairment, and pre-mature cell aging","<title>Monitoring antioxidant defenses and free radical production in space-flight, aviation and railway engine operators, for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, immunological impairment, and pre-mature cell aging</title> <abstract>Degenerative diseases, immune impairment, and premature ageing commonly affect professional categories exposed to severe environmental and psychological stress. Among these, cosmonauts routinely experience extreme conditions due to microgravity, space radiation, altered oxygen supply, physical and mental fatigue during training, spaceflight, and post-flight. Long route aviation pilots display elevated oncogenic risk, connected with cosmic radiation overexposure, and high mortality rates for cardiovascular causes. Engine drivers, like pilots, are affected by health consequences of psycho-emotional stress, and burnout syndrome. The free radical (FR)/antioxidant (AO) imbalance is a common feature in all these pathological conditions. To assess the effective relevance of oxidative stress, we analyzed blood and urine reliable markers of FR production and AO defenses in 12 Russian cosmonauts, 55 airline pilots, 63 train engine drivers, and 50 age-matched controls by measuring the following: (a) lipophilic/hydrophilic low-molecular weight AO and AO enzyme activities, (b) nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroperoxide production, and (c) urinary catecholamine/serotonine metabolites and lipoperoxidation markers. Cosmonauts showed elevated granulocyte superoxide and nitric oxide production, increased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione oxidation, and drastically decreased plasma/leucocyte lipophilic AO levels (P < 0.001–0.01). Aviation pilots, like train drivers, displayed a mild but constant oxidative stress, more pronounced in intercontinental routes pilots, and consistent with lymphocyte chromosomal alterations, DNA oxidation, and cardiovascular malfunction. Results obtained on these selected professionals operating under wearing conditions offer a solid molecular basis for advising the regular monitoring of clinical biochemistry laboratory markers of AO/FR status, to tailor individually specific AO supplementation and diet regimen, and monitor treatment outcomes. © 2009, SAGE Publications.

Thepresent study aimed atevaluating theperception oflight stimulus via the Critical Flicker Fusion threshold (CFF) measurements among aviation pilots. Materials and Methods: Thestudy was carried out under hypoxic conditions corresponding to 5000m altitude, for aperiod of 30min, without theuse ofsupplemental oxygen. Fourteen volunteer pilots, 23-30 years ofage, were examined in thehypobaric chamber (HC). Themeasurements were performed atnormobaria and attheinitial and final phase of hypoxia. Heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SaO<inf>2</inf>) were monitored. Results: The high altitude hypoxia was found to produce adecrease in the CFF threshold F(3.39) = 3.207, p< 0.05, and SaO<inf>2</inf> F(3.39) = 52.651, p< 0.001, as well as HR increase F(3.39) = 7.356, p< 0.001. Theresults indicate that thehigher thedecrease in SaO<inf>2</inf> under hypoxic conditions, thehigher thedecrease in CFF r= .567 p< 0.05. Likewise, thehigher theincrease in HR, thehigher thedecrease in CFF r= -0.491 p< 0.05. Conclusions: Under hypoxic conditions, theperceptual ability of thepilots is gradually decreasing. This has been confirmed by the findings of thephysiological examinations. Theauthors express anopinion that it would be advisable to introduce CFF measurement into thehypobaric chamber tests as it allows individual assessment ofthepilot's perceptual ability under conditions ofincomplete physiological compensation ofthehigh altitude hypoxia.</abstract>"
2009,Australia - United States,The impact of service operations failures on customer satisfaction: evidence on how failures and their source affect what matters to customers,"<title>The impact of service operations failures on customer satisfaction: evidence on how failures and their source affect what matters to customers</title> <abstract>Research in consumer psychology shows that customers seek reasons for service failures and that attributions of blame moderate the effects of failure on the level of customer satisfaction. This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction. © 2009 INFORMS.</abstract>"

2008,United States,Linking task analysis to information relevance,"<title>Linking task analysis to information relevance</title> <abstract>Objective: The main objective of this study is to present a methodology for computing information relevance. Background: Relevance is a pervasive term used in several domains, such as pragmatics, information science, and psychology. Quantifying the relevance of information can be helpful in effective display design. Displays should be designed so that the more relevant information is more easily accessed. Method: This procedure focuses on computing the relevance of a piece of information by taking into account three aspects of tasks that use the information: the number of different tasks that make use of the information, the frequency of occurrence of those tasks, and the criticality of those tasks. The methodology can be used to compute the aggregate relevance of a piece of information for a particular component of a system or for the entire system. This methodology was illustrated using the domain of air traffic control (ATC). Results: In support of the validity of the methodology, we were able to confirm the value of weather information and traffic information in ATC towers. Conclusion: The method can be used to derive information relevance, a characteristic of information that has implications for display design for any domain. Application: Designers can use information about aggregate relevance to design information displays that feature the most relevant information.

Forty-four flight attendants filled in a questionnaire and a diary booklet before and after consecutive flights to three intercontinental destinations. Results of multilevel analyses revealed that colleague support had unique positive effects on self-efficacy and work engagement. Self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between support and engagement, but work engagement mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and (in-role and extra-role) performance. In addition, colleague support had an indirect effect on in-role performance through work engagement. These findings shed light on the motivational process as outlined in the JD-R model, and suggest that colleague support is an important job resource for flight attendants helping them reach their work-related goals. © 2008 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2008,United Kingdom,Cognitive function following exposure to contaminated air on commercial aircraft: A case series of 27 pilots seen for clinical purposes,"<title>Cognitive function following exposure to contaminated air on commercial aircraft: A case series of 27 pilots seen for clinical purposes</title> <abstract>Background. Cabin air on commercial aircraft is sometimes contaminated with hydraulic fluids, synthetic jet engine oils and combusted or pyrolized materials. The incidence of contaminated air events is hard to quantify as commercial aircraft do not have air quality monitoring systems on board. In the UK, around 350 aircrew have advised their union that they may be suffering physical and psychological ill health following exposure to contaminated air. Design. This paper presents a case series of 27 pilots referred for psychological assessment. The general aim of the assessment was to determine whether pilots show evidence of cognitive impairment and whether this relates to exposure history. Materials and method. All pilots underwent neuropsychological and adult mental health assessment, undertaken by 12 examiners, instructed to search for alternative explanations other than exposure to toxic fumes for any symptoms reported. Results. Pilots reported alarming cognitive failures at work such as being unable to retain or confusing numerical information from Air Traffic Control. Nine pilots were excluded from further analysis because they had a medical or psychiatric condition which might otherwise explain these difficulties. In the remaining 18 pilots, language, perceptual skills and general intellectual ability were preserved, but performance on tests of psychomotor speed, attention and executive functioning was below expected levels. Conclusions. The cognitive deficits identified in this cohort of pilots cannot be attributed to factors such as mood disorder or malingering. However, the evidence available in this study does not enable firm conclusions to be drawn regarding a causal link with contaminated air; the cohort of pilots was self-selected and only crude indices of exposure were available. Further research is warranted given the scientific uncertainty regarding the health effects of inhalation of heated or pyrolized engine oil. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.</abstract>"

Visual displays simulated landing approaches with trial-to-trial variations in glideslope, lighting, and scene detail. Twenty-four participants (8 private pilots, 8 student pilots, and 8 nonpilots) were instructed to initiate the flare when they perceived that their TTC with the runway (30 m wide by 840 m long) had reached a critical value of 2 seconds.

2008,United Kingdom,Enumeration: Shape information and expertise,"<title>Enumeration: Shape information and expertise</title> <abstract>This study examined the interaction between grouping information and expertise in a simple enumeration task. In two experiments, participants made rapid judgements about the number of items present in a visual display. Within each display, items were grouped into a canonical representation (e.g., triangle, square, and pentagon) or were arranged linearly. In both experiments, grouping information facilitated enumeration performance, replicating previous findings in the literature. In Experiment 2, the facilitative effect of grouping information was found to be greater for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) than for matched novices, though they were no better than novices on linear arrays. This may be because linear, like canonical arrays, hold unique numerosity information, but only when they contain the minimum number of points necessary to define a line (i.e., 2). So ATCs' performance on linear arrays containing more than two items does not benefit from a facilitative effect of grouping information. That their experience of being ATCs, in terms of years served, was shown to account for the expertise effect suggests that such visuospatial expertise is acquired through frequent exposure to spatial arrays. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

2008,,Human health and performance for long-duration spaceflight,"<title>Human health and performance for long-duration spaceflight</title> <abstract>Future long-duration spaceflights are now being planned to the Moon and Mars as a part of the ""Vision for Space Exploration"" program initiated by NASA in 2004. This report describes the design reference missions for the International Space Station, Lunar Base, and eventually a Mars Expedition. There is a need to develop more stringent preflight medical screening for crewmembers to minimize risk factors for diseases which cannot be effectively treated in flight. Since funding for space life sciences research and development has been eliminated to fund program development, these missions will be enabled by countermeasures much like those currently in use aboard the International Space Station. Artificial gravity using centrifugation in a rotating spacecraft has been suggested repeatedly as a ""universal countermeasure"" against deconditioning in microgravity and could be an option if other countermeasures are found to be ineffective. However, the greatest medical unknown in interplanetary flight may be the effects of radiation exposure. In addition, a Mars expedition would lead to a far greater level of isolation and psychological stress than any space mission attempted previously; because of this, psychiatric decompensation remains a risk. Historically, mortality and morbidity related to illness and injury have accounted for more failures and delays in new exploration than have defective transportation systems. The medical care system on a future Mars expedition will need to be autonomous and self-sufficient due to the extremely long separation from definitive medical care. This capability could be expanded by the presence of a physician in the crew and including simple, low-technology surgical capability. Copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2008,Australia,"Subjective Cognitive Effort: A Model of States, Traits, and Time","<title>Subjective Cognitive Effort: A Model of States, Traits, and Time</title> <abstract>Self-regulation theories were used to develop a dynamic model of the determinants of subjective cognitive effort. The authors assessed the roles of malleable states and stable individual differences. Subjective cognitive effort and perceived difficulty were measured while individuals performed an air traffic control task. As expected, Conscientiousness moderated the effort trajectory. Individuals with high Conscientiousness maintained subjective cognitive effort at high levels for longer than their counterparts. There were also individual differences in reactions to perceptions of task difficulty. The intra-individual relationship between perceived difficulty and subjective cognitive effort was stronger for individuals with low ability or low Conscientiousness than for their counterparts. A follow-up study showed that the measures of perceived difficulty and subjective cognitive effort were sensitive to a task difficulty manipulation as well as that the relationship between perceived difficulty and subjective cognitive effort held after controlling for self-set goal level. These findings contribute to the self-regulation literature by identifying factors that influence changes in subjective cognitive effort during skill acquisition. © 2008 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2008,Israel,Sinusitis in pilots of different aircraft types: Is allergic rhinitis a predisposing factor?,"<title>Sinusitis in pilots of different aircraft types: Is allergic rhinitis a predisposing factor?</title> <abstract>Background: Despite the high association of allergic rhinitis and acute sinusitis, their exact relationship remains unclear, especially in pilots. The purpose of this study was to analyze the possible relationship of a history of allergic rhinitis with the occurrence of acute sinusitis in Israeli air force pilots. A comparative case series was conducted. Methods: Events of acute sinusitis were compared between Israeli air force pilots with (n = 54) and without (n = 82) allergic rhinitis who presented for their annual physical examination. Results: Previous episodes of acute sinusitis were noted in 33% of the pilots with allergic rhinitis and 21% of the control group (p = 0.09). A separate analysis of young pilots (<26 years old) yielded corresponding rates of 57% versus 29% (p < 0.001). When the groups were divided by type of pilot, the results showed that 54% of the transport pilots, 34% of the fighter pilots, and 13% of the helicopter pilots with rhinitis also suffered from acute sinusitis, as opposed to 28, 15, and 15%, respectively, of the control group. Conclusion: Despite careful selection, allergic rhinitis is still a very common disease in pilots and may pose a risk of acute sinusitis. The lower prevalence of acute sinusitis in combat than in transport pilots with rhinitis may be explained by vasoconstriction due to psychological and physiological stress during flight missions.

The 35 cabin crew undertook a mock resuscitation scenario using the AED and bag-valve-mask carried in the medical kit. Of the 35 subjects, 33 subjects failed to use the bag-mask correctly, 18 performed chest compressions at the incorrect site, only 13 achieved the correct compression depth, only 20 placed the AED pads correctly, and the average time to first shock was 110 s after commencement of the resuscitation. While theoretical first aid knowledge was high, the participants held low levels of self-confidence in their CPR and AED skills. The results of this study indicate that cabin crew may not have sufficiently high levels of skill to manage a cardiac arrest adequately. This suggests that existing approaches to training of cabin crew require further investigation and modification. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

This paper is a report of a study to examine the relationships between work-related psychosocial factors and lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders among long-haul international female flight attendants. Background. Recent attention has focused on the influence of work-related psychosocial factors on work-related musculoskeletal disorders. To date, however, little is known about the influence of psychosocial factors at work on lower back work-related musculoskeletal disorders in female flight attendants. Method. A cross-sectional, mailed survey was conducted in 2004 with flight attendants in one major airline who were randomly selected from a union membership list. The work-related psychosocial factors included psychological job demand, decision latitude, social support, job insecurity, and external environmental concerns. Physical load was defined by overall strenuousness across 41 job tasks and measured by a 4-point scale of strenuousness. Lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders were defined as lower-back symptoms that occurred at least once a month or lasted at least 1 week in the past year and caused at least moderate pain. Findings. The flight attendants with lower back work-related musculoskeletal disorders, compared with those without lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders, had higher perceived psychological job demands, job insecurity, and physical load. After controlling for physical load and personal factors, high job insecurity significantly increased the risk for lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion. Occupational health nurses in the airline industry should be cognizant of the importance of assessing the influence of both job tasks and work-related psychosocial factors on lower-back work-related musculoskeletal disorders. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract>"
2008,France,Determinants of conflict detection: A model of risk judgments in air traffic control,"<title>Determinants of conflict detection: A model of risk judgments in air traffic control</title> <abstract>Objective: A model of conflict judgments in air traffic control (ATC) is proposed. Background: Three horizontal distances determine risk judgments about conflict between two aircraft: (a) Dt<inf>0</inf> is the distance between the crossing of the aircraft trajectories and the first aircraft to reach that point; (b) Dt<inf>h</inf> is the distance between the two aircraft when they are horizontally closest; and (c) Dt<inf>v</inf> is the horizontal distance between the two aircraft when their growing vertical distance reaches 1,000 feet. Methods: Two experiments tested whether the variables in the model reflect what controllers do. In Experiment 1, 125 certified controllers provided risk judgments about situations in which the model variables were manipulated. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between the model and expertise by comparing a population of certified controllers with a population of ATC students. Results: Across both experiments, the model accounted for 44% to 50% of the variance in risk judgments by certified controllers (N = 161) but only 20% in judgments by ATC students (N = 88). There were major individual differences in the predictive power of the model as well as in the contributions of the three variables. In Experiment 2, the model described experts better than novices. Conclusion: The model provided a satisfying account of the data, albeit with substantial individual differences. It is argued that an individual-differences approach is required when investigating the strategies involved in conflict judgment in ATC. Application: These findings should have implications for developing user-friendly interfaces with conflict detection devices and for devising ATC training programs.

2008,Japan,Urinary catecholamine responses in F-15 pilots: Evaluation of the stress induced by long-distance flights,"<title>Urinary catecholamine responses in F-15 pilots: Evaluation of the stress induced by long-distance flights</title> <abstract>Included in the Cooperative Cope Thunder exercises from Japan to Alaska is one of the longest distance flight missions carried out by Japan Air-Self Defense Force F-15 pilots. The magnitude of the flight stress of these pilots is considered to be quite high. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the flight stress induced by the long-distance flights. The subjects were eight pilots who participated on a volunteer basis. Samples of urine were collected ∼30 minutes before (preflight) and 20 minutes after (postflight) the flights. The ratios (post-:preflight) of noradrenaline levels were 1.20 ± 0.09 (Japan-Alaska) and 1.32 ± 0.12 (Alaska-Japan), and those of adrenaline were 4.03 ± 1.06 and 3.68 ± 0.98. These results strongly suggest that psychological stress during the long-distance flights is increased in the fighter pilots.

2008,Germany,"Impact of sound and vibration on health, travel comfort and performance of flight attendants and pilots","<title>Impact of sound and vibration on health, travel comfort and performance of flight attendants and pilots</title> <abstract>Noise and vibration affect flight attendants and pilots at their workplace in cabin and cockpit, respectively, besides numerous other physical environmental parameters, e.g. air quality, draft, temperature distribution, humidity, glare. Additionally, the physiological setting and psychological attitude modulate the impact of environmental parameters. The relation between environmental parameters at the specific work place and the subjective and medical response and performance was investigated in the European project HEACE (www.heace.org). Investigations were conducted in simulators and mock-ups as well as in real long-haul flights. Environmental measurements were performed with the help of the project partners EADS-CRC, BRE, itap GmbH and Paragon Ltd. Physiological and medical data were recorded by the Medical University Vienna. Questionnaires were designed with support of BRE. A comprehensive data analysis was performed with BRE, CIRA and University of Patras. The sound level is one important parameter besides air quality with negative impact on subjective feeling and significant bias on the crew's performance, in particular effective during long-haul flights. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

2007,Australia,Development and initial validation of an Aviation Safety Climate Scale,"<title>Development and initial validation of an Aviation Safety Climate Scale</title> <abstract>Problem: A need was identified for a consistent set of safety climate factors to provide a basis for aviation industry benchmarking. Method: Six broad safety climate themes were identified from the literature and consultations with industry safety experts. Items representing each of the themes were prepared and administered to 940 Australian commercial pilots. Results: Data from half of the sample (N = 468) were used in an exploratory factor analysis that produced a 3-factor model of Management commitment and communication, Safety training and equipment, and Maintenance. A confirmatory factor analysis on the remaining half of the sample showed the 3-factor model to be an adequate fit to the data. Discussion: The results of this study have produced a scale of safety climate for aviation that is both reliable and valid. Impact on Industry: This study developed a tool to assess the level of perceived safety climate, specifically of pilots, but may also, with minor modifications, be used to assess other groups' perceptions of safety climate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

2007,"Taiwan, Province of China",Burnout and workplace deviance among flight attendants in Taiwan,"<title>Burnout and workplace deviance among flight attendants in Taiwan</title> <abstract>The relationship between burnout and workplace deviance, identified as a component of job performance, was examined. Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory which has three dimensions, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment. Workplace deviance was defined as voluntary behavior that violates significant organizational norms and threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both. This was assessed with the Workplace Deviance Scale, measuring the extent to which the participants had engaged in workplace deviant behavior such as taking property from work without permission, making fun of someone at work, or cursing at someone at work. Anonymous questionnaires with stamped envelopes were distributed to a sample of 1,470 Taiwanese flight attendants at the Arrival Hall of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. A response rate of 22.45% was obtained. After cases with missing data (n = 27) had been eliminated, the sample totaled 303, 17 men and 286 women. The average age was 28.7 yr. (SD = 4.6). Results of hierarchical regression showed that Depersonalization scores were significantly predictive of Workplace Deviance scores but not Emotional Exhaustion and Reduced Personal Accomplishment scores. Possible reasons and implications of these findings were discussed. © Psychological reports 2007.</abstract>"
2007,Japan,Effects of flight workload on urinary catecholamine responses in experienced military pilots,"<title>Effects of flight workload on urinary catecholamine responses in experienced military pilots</title> <abstract>Summary.-This study investigated the flight responses induced by strenuous acrobatic demonstration flight and an air-to-air combat maneuvering flight in experienced pilots. Subjects were 54 military male pilots on a volunteer basis: 8 T-4 pilots (M = 35.8 yr., SD = 4.9), 15 F-4 pilots (M = 32.6 yr., SD = 5.1), 13 F-15 pilots (M = 33.8 yr., SD=1.0), and 18 F-2 pilots (M = 33.7 yr., SD = 3.9). Samples of urine were collected approximately 30 min. before and 20 min. after the flights. The postflight adrenaline in all pilots was significantly higher than at preflight, while a significant increase in noradrenaline at postflight was not observed. The post-/preflight ratio of adrenaline in all pilots was relatively similar and high. These findings might be regarded as a result of autonomie nervous system response to the flight workload of military pilots. Especially is increment in sympathetic activity considered to play an important part in psychological adaptation to flight. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2007.</abstract>"
2007,United States,Dual-task performance consequences of imperfect alerting associated with a cockpit display of traffic information,"<title>Dual-task performance consequences of imperfect alerting associated with a cockpit display of traffic information</title> <abstract>Objective: Performance consequences related to integrating an imperfect alert within a complex task domain were examined in two experiments. Background: Cockpit displays of traffic information (CDTIs) are being designed for use in airplane cockpits as responsibility for safe separation becomes shared between pilots and controllers. Of interest in this work is how characteristics of the alarm system such as threshold, modality, and number of alert levels impact concurrent task (flight control) performance and response to potential conflicts. Methods: Student pilots performed a tracking task analogous to flight control while simultaneously monitoring for air traffic conflicts with the aid of a CDTI alert as the threshold, modality, and level of alert was varied. Results: As the alerting system became more prone to false alerts, pilot compliance decreased and concurrent performance improved. There was some evidence of auditory preemption with auditory alerts as the false alarm rate increased. Finally, there was no benefit to a three-level system over a two-level system. Conclusion: There is justification for increased false alarm rates, as miss-prone systems appear to be costly. The 4:1 false alarm to miss ratio employed here improved accuracy and concurrent task performance. More research needs to address the potential benefits of likelihood alerting. Application: The issues addressed in this research can be applied to any imperfect alerting system such as in aviation, driving, or air traffic control. It is crucial to understand the performance consequences of new technology and the efficacy of potential mitigating design features within the specific context desired.

2007,Iceland,"Self-assessed occupational health and working environment of female nurses, cabin crew and teachers","<title>Self-assessed occupational health and working environment of female nurses, cabin crew and teachers</title> <abstract>Aim: The aim of this study was to describe and compare the self-assessed occupational health among female nurses, cabin crew and teachers, in relation to their working environment. Background: Similarities between the three occupations, i.e. predominantly female and service-oriented, render them interesting in comparison with respect to health and working environment. Methods: The participants were female Icelandic cabin crew, nurses and elementary school teachers. A questionnaire including items on socio-demographics, working environment (addressing work pace, job security, monotonous work, assistance, physically strenuous work and physical environmental factors) and a symptom list was used for data collection. Factor analyses on the symptom list resulted in five symptom scales: Musculoskeletal, Stress and exhaustion, Common cold, Gastrointestinal and Sound perception scale. A total of 1571 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 65.7-69%, depending on occupation. Data were collected in 2002. Results: Cabin crew reported worse gastrointestinal, sound perception and common cold symptoms than nurses and teachers. Cabin crew and teachers reported worse symptoms of stress and exhaustion than nurses (p < 0.05). When compared with teachers and nurses cabin crew reported less job security and more physically strenuous and monotonous work. Nurses were likelier to seek assistance from co-workers or patients as well as to take care of an older relative than teachers and cabin crew. Regression analysis found that within each occupation distress from environmental factors resulted in higher score on all the symptom scales. Conclusions: Nurses experience less stress and exhaustion than teachers and cabin crew. In comparison with one or both of the other occupations nurses are more likely to assist each other with their work, experience job security, reporting physically complex work and take care of older relatives. This should be highlighted as positive aspects of nurses' work praised as displaying responsibility and interconnectedness of nurses'. © 2007 The Authors.

2007,Pakistan - Sweden,Memory performance during G exposure as assessed by a word recognition task,"<title>Memory performance during G exposure as assessed by a word recognition task</title> <abstract>Background: Pilots of modern fighter aircraft are exposed to substantial physiological and mental stressors. The objective of this study was to investigate how memory performance, in terms of encoding and/or retrieval processes, was affected by sustained +Gz exposure. Method: There were 18 healthy men ranging from experienced fighter pilots to novice riders who participated. A word continuous recognition task (CRT) was employed as a memory test. The task consisted of three consecutive phases: 1) encoding of familiar words at 1 G; 2) encoding and retrieval of words at 70% of the subject's relaxed G-tolerance level, equivalent to +3.7 ± 0.54 Gz; and 3) encoding and retrieval of words at 1 G. In addition, each subject performed the CRT in a 1-G-only control condition. Physiological and psycho-physiological measures included continuous monitoring of ECG, arterial oxygen saturation, arterial BP at head level, and response time. Results: Data analysis showed that the capability to recognize words encoded at 1 G did not differ between conditions, indicating that the retrieval process was insensitive to increased Gz load. However, the ability to recognize words previously encoded during G exposure was reduced by approximately 10% as compared with control. Since the analysis revealed that the words were perceived, this result suggests that the encoding process was impaired in hypergravity. Conclusion: The results indicate that memory encoding, but not retrieval, was affected negatively when exposed to substantial and sustained +Gz loads.

2007,United Kingdom,Color coding of control room displays: The psychocartography of visual layering effects,"<title>Color coding of control room displays: The psychocartography of visual layering effects</title> <abstract>Objective: To evaluate which of three color coding methods (monochrome, maximally discriminable, and visual layering) used to code four types of control room display format (bars, tables, trend, mimic) was superior in two classes of task (search, compare). Background: It has recently been shown that color coding of visual layers, as used in cartography, may be used to color code any type of information display, but this has yet to be fully evaluated. Method: Twenty-four people took part in a 2 (task) x 3 (coding method) x 4 (format) wholly repeated measures design. The dependent variables assessed were target location reaction time, error rates, workload, and subjective feedback. Results: Overall, the visual layers coding method produced significantly faster reaction times than did the maximally discriminable and the monochrome methods for both the search and compare tasks. No significant difference in errors was observed between conditions for either task type. Significantly less perceived workload was experienced with the visual layers coding method, which was also rated more highly than the other coding methods on a 14-item visual display quality questionnaire. Conclusion: The visual layers coding method is superior to other color coding methods for control room displays when the method supports the user's task. Application: The visual layers color coding method has wide applicability to the design of all complex information displays utilizing color coding, from the most maplike (e.g., air traffic control) to the most abstract (e.g., abstracted ecological display).

2007,Australia,How time flies: A study of novice skydivers,"<title>How time flies: A study of novice skydivers</title> <abstract>Although time distortion is commonly reported during a traumatic experience, there is little research addressing the phenomenon. This study investigated the role of affect in time perception in a very stressful experience by indexing novice tandem skydivers' (N = 76) levels of fear and excitement before the skydive and soon after landing. Estimations of how long skydivers thought their experience lasted were obtained after landing. Whereas increased fear was associated with the perception of time passing slowly, increased excitement was associated with the perception of time passing quickly. These data support models of time perception based on avoidance and approach motivations influencing time distortion. © 2006.</abstract>"
2007,United States,Comparing cognitive models and human behavior models: Computational tools for expressing human behavior,"<title>Comparing cognitive models and human behavior models: Computational tools for expressing human behavior</title> <abstract>This paper introduces two different methods for expressing human behavior in computational terms. Cognitive models are designed to capture and express low-level details of human behavior and typically emphasize prediction and generality. The paper reviews a recent cognitive model of an abstract performance and learning task inspired by en-route air traffic control. Human behavior models focus on encoding the knowledge a human uses to perform a complex task. For example, the paper reviews TacAir-Soar (a pilot model for tactical air missions) and MOUTBots (an opponent model for urban combat training). While constrained and informed by psychological factors, human behavior models typically focus more on the real-time generation of complex behavior rather than low-level details of cognition. The paper discusses design and implementation trade-offs in the individual approaches and introduces dimensions that characterize similarities and differences between cognitive models and human behavior models.

2007,Israel,Bruxism in military pilots and non-pilots: Tooth wear and psychological stress,"<title>Bruxism in military pilots and non-pilots: Tooth wear and psychological stress</title> <abstract>Background: Bruxism is the diurnal or nocturnal para-functional habit of clenching or grinding the teeth and affects 5-10% of the general western population. Bruxism can cause pain and irreversible damage to the teeth, periodontium, masticatory muscles, and temporo-mandibular joint. Variables such as general stress, work-related stress, and personality traits have been increasingly considered as initiating, predisposing, and perpetuating factors for bruxism. We sought to evaluate the potential of work-related stress and personality factors to induce bruxism among military pilots and non-pilot officers. Methods: Subjects were 57 healthy male Israel Air Force officers (mean age 25.8 ± 4.3 yr). Of these, 17 were jet-pilots, 18 helicopter-pilots, and 22 non-pilot officers. Tooth-wear was classified according to a six-point scale. In addition, the subjects responded to a battery of psychological questionnaires for self-assessment of stress at the workplace and their coping behavior. Results: Bruxism of clinical importance (i.e., with dentin exposure) was found in 69% of the aircrew members but only 27% of the non-pilot group. No difference was found between groups regarding stress levels. Discussion: Military aircrews may be relatively vulnerable to deleterious bruxism as well as other signs of chronic stress. Among bruxers, pilots tended to show coping strategies that were significantly more emotional and less task-oriented than non-pilots, whereas non-bruxers showed no significant differences in coping behavior. This study suggest that integrating dental and psychological preventive intervention may be helpful. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2007,United States,Designing for flexible interaction between humans and automation: Delegation interfaces for supervisory control,"<title>Designing for flexible interaction between humans and automation: Delegation interfaces for supervisory control</title> <abstract>Objective: To develop a method enabling human-like, flexible supervisory control via delegation to automation. Background: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance. Method: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to ""adaptable"") automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a ""level of automation"" as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook® is described. Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team's ""playbook."" Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles. Conclusion: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level. Application: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate. We present an extended example for uninhabited air vehicle mission planning. Copyright © 2007, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2007,United States,Predicting dual-task performance with the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ),"<title>Predicting dual-task performance with the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ)</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective was to assess the validity of the Multiple Resources Questionnaire (MRQ) in predicting dual-task interference. Background: Subjective workload measures such as the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) and NASA Task Load Index are sensitive to single-task parameters and dual-task loads but have not attempted to measure workload in particular mental processes. An alternative is the MRQ. Method: In Experiment 1, participants completed simple laboratory tasks and the MRQ after each. Interference between tasks was then correlated to three different task similarity metrics: profile similarity, based on r2 between ratings; overlap similarity, based on summed minima; and overall demand, based on summed ratings. Experiment 2 used similar methods but more complex computer-based games. Results: In Experiment 1 the MRQ moderately predicted interference (r = +.37), with no significant difference between metrics. In Experiment 2 the metric effect was significant, with overlap similarity excelling in predicting interference (r = +.83). Mean ratings showed high diagnosticity in identifying specific mental processing bottlenecks. Conclusion: The MRQ shows considerable promise as a cognitive-process-sensitive workload measure. Application: Potential applications of the MRQ include the identification of dual-processing bottlenecks as well as process overloads in single tasks, preparatory to redesign in areas such as air traffic management, advanced flight displays, and medical imaging.

2007,United States,Some lasting consequences of US Psychology Programs in World Wars I and II,"<title>Some lasting consequences of US Psychology Programs in World Wars I and II</title> <abstract>Applied research in psychology not only has contributed directly to societal advances but often has fostered basic research as well. Prominent examples are die programs directed by Yerkes in World War I to develop the Army Alpha test and several programs in World War II, including The American Soldier diat assessed soldiers' attitudes during the war; a program for selecting agents for the Office of Strategic Services; and the Aviation Psychology Program to select and classify applicants for flight training in the Army Air Forces. Highlights of these programs are presented here, with special attention given to by far the largest, the Air Forces program. After World War Il, many of the hundreds of psychologist veterans became prominent research psychologists. Most became university professors. Among those who continued to work in applied settings was John Flanagan who had served as Chief of the Army Air Forces Psychology Branch. (After the war, Saul Sells succeeded Flanagan as Head of the Aviation Psychology program.) Flanagan founded the American Institutes for Research (AIR), the earliest mission of which was to select flight personnel for civilian airlines. Another part of the AIR mission was to enhance civilian air safety by assuring the widespread use of Flanagan's critical-incident procedures (or near-accident reports) that now serve to reduce accident rates in a variety of industries as well as in aviation.

However, while most researchers implicitly or explicitly accept the idea that abilities and skill acquisition should be related, empirical research has failed to provide evidence for a consistently strong correlation between the two constructs. Based on the reanalysis of a study on skill acquisition using the air traffic controller task TRACON [Ackerman, P. L., Kanfer, R., and Goff, M. (1995). Cognitive and Noncognitive Determinants and Consequences of Complex Skill Acquisition. Journal of Experimental Psychology. Applied, 1(4), 270-304], it will be shown how latent growth curve modeling can help to gain a better understanding of the relationship between human abilities and skill acquisition. A brief introduction into the basic concepts of latent growth curve modeling will be given, particularly with regard to the advantages for the analysis of skill acquisition and its determinants. The goal is thereby to provide evidence for a much closer association than commonly assumed and to offer a new, differential, perspective formerly obscured by traditional between-subject analyses. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

2006,Turkey,In-cabin noise levels during commercial aircraft flights,"<title>In-cabin noise levels during commercial aircraft flights</title> <abstract>Air transport is one of the most commonly used mode of transportation and hence passenger comfort is highly desirable. Aircraft interior noise is important, especially in long-term flights, concerning the health, comfort, and psychological wellness of both passengers and flight crew. Noise levels, which changes according to different motions of aircraft, can be defined as the noise during takeoff and landing and during level flight (cruise). There are also non-aircraft-originating noise sources in the cabin. These can be classified into those caused by passenger activities such as conversations and luggage-related rearrangements as well as those caused by flight-crew such as flight attendant-related speaking activities, announcements from pilot and flight attendants, mechanical noises during food/beverage services and flight security demonstrations, and other announcement signals. In this study, in-cabin noise levels were measured during all flight activities in a commercial jet passenger plane. These noise levels consist of both continuous and discontinuous types. As a general tendency, continuous noise levels were seen to be 60-65 dB(A) prior to takeoff, and 80-85 dB(A) and 75-80 dB(A) during flight and landing, respectively. Discontinuous in-cabin noise levels were observed to reach levels as high as 81-88 dB(A) range. This study shows that it can be possible to control and reduce in-cabin noise levels, especially due to human activities and a few recommendations are suggested.</abstract>"
2006,United States,Pilot medical history and medications found in post mortem specimens from aviation accidents,"<title>Pilot medical history and medications found in post mortem specimens from aviation accidents</title> <abstract>Introduction: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations require pilots to report all medications and medical conditions for review and consideration as to the overall suitability of the pilot for flight activities. Methods: Specimens were collected by local pathologists from aviation accidents and sent to the Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory for analysis. The results of such tests were entered into the Forensic Case Management System. This database was searched to identify all pilots found positive for medications used to treat cardiovascular, psychological, or neurological conditions over the period January 1, 1993, through December 31, 2003. Results: Toxicological evaluations were performed on 4143 pilots. Psychotropic drugs were found in 223 pilots. Cardiovascular medications were found in 149 pilots. Neurological medications were found in 15 pilots. Pilots reported psychological conditions in 14 of the 223 pilots found positive for psychotropic drugs. Only 1 of the 14 pilots reporting a psychological condition to the FAA reported the psychotropic medication found after the accident. Cardiovascular disease was reported by 69 of the pilots found with cardiovascular drugs in their system. Cardiovascular medications found in the pilots were reported by 29 of the 69 pilots reporting a cardiovascular condition. Only 1 of the 15 pilots reported having a neurological condition to the FAA; none of the pilots found with neurological medications reported the medication. Conclusions: Toxicology successfully identified 93% of the medications reported by the pilots. Pilots involved in fatal accidents taking psychotropic or neurological medications rarely reported the medication or their underlying medical condition to the FAA.

A higher proportion of flight attendants than nurses or teachers were smokers, 26% vs. 15% and 17% respectively; and consumed alcohol at least once a week, 40% vs. 21% and 16%. Repeated sexual harassment at work was more common among the flight attendants, 31% vs. 8% and 4%; whereas bullying, physical violence and threats were less prevalent among the flight attendants (12%) than among nurses (19%). Flight attendants were on average somewhat taller, but weighed on average less, 63.8 kg vs. 72.4 kg and 72.7 kg respectively. Repeated exposure to sexual harassment, bullying, violence and threats was related to less physical and psychological well-being in all the groups. Teachers scored on average significantly lower than did the flight attendants on general health and physical well-being, while nurses did not. © 2006 IOS Press. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2006,Australia,An examination of the dynamic relationship between self-efficacy and performance across levels of analysis and levels of specificity,"<title>An examination of the dynamic relationship between self-efficacy and performance across levels of analysis and levels of specificity</title> <abstract>This research used resource allocation theory to generate predictions regarding dynamic relationships between self-efficacy and task performance from 2 levels of analysis and specificity. Participants were given multiple trials of practice on an air traffic control task. Measures of task-specific self-efficacy and performance were taken at repeated intervals. The authors used multilevel analysis to demonstrate differential and dynamic effects. As predicted, task-specific self-efficacy was negatively associated with task performance at the within-person level. On the other hand, average levels of task-specific self-efficacy were positively related to performance at the between-persons level and mediated the effect of general self-efficacy. The key findings from this research relate to dynamic effects - these results show that self-efficacy effects can change over time, but it depends on the level of analysis and specificity at which self-efficacy is conceptualized. These novel findings emphasize the importance of conceptualizing self-efficacy within a multilevel and multispecificity framework and make a significant contribution to understanding the way this construct relates to task performance.

2006,United States,Fatigue and related human factors in the near crash of a large military aircraft,"<title>Fatigue and related human factors in the near crash of a large military aircraft</title> <abstract>Introduction: During approach to a remote island location, a U.S. Air Force heavy-airlift aircraft was flown into an aerodynamic stall, resulting in the loss of more than 4000 ft of altitude, with the crew recovering the aircraft just before impact would have occurred. Methods: An analysis of the mishap was conducted through a review of non-privileged USAF mishap data, cockpit voice recordings, flight data records, and interviews of the aircrew involved. A thorough examination of fatigue-related factors was conducted, including computerized fatigue modeling, Results: The crew traveled over 11,000 mi in a westward direction over a 6-d period. They had been on duty for nearly 21 h on the day of the mishap, with minimal in-flight rest. The pilots were late beginning their descent for landing, and a minor aircraft malfunction distracted the crew, contributing to channelized attention and degraded situational awareness. A breakdown in crew communication and failure to adequately monitor and interpret true aircraft state culminated in loss of aircraft control. Analysis of the crew's work/rest schedule confirmed that multiple elements of fatigue were present during this mishap, including acute and cumulative fatigue, circadian disruptions, and sleep inertia. Additionally, reduced situational awareness and spatial disorientation, exacerbated by the underlying fatigue, were causal in this mishap. Discussion: This mishap highlights the importance of maintaining a high degree of situational awareness during long-haul flights with a continuing need to address issues regarding spatial disorientation, proper application of human engineering principles in modern cockpits, and mitigation of aircrew fatigue factors. © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2006,United Kingdom,Prevalence of fatigue among commercial pilots,"<title>Prevalence of fatigue among commercial pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Short-haul pilots have largely been neglected in studies of fatigue, sleep loss and circadian disruption created by flight operations, but anecdotal evidence from pilots suggests that with the increasing amount of low-cost air travel, commercial pilots working short-haul operations may be becoming seriously fatigued. Aims: This study attempted to ascertain how much subjective fatigue short-haul pilots reported, and makes comparisons between low-cost and scheduled airline pilots. Methods: Pilots completed anonymous questionnaires (encompassing aviation factors, flight experience and a fatigue scale) posted on the Professional Pilots' Rumours Network website. Results: Data were collected from 162 short-haul pilots and statistical adjustment for operational factors was made. Seventy-five percent reported severe fatigue and 81% reported the fatigue to be worse than 2 years ago. Eighty percent considered their thought processes were reduced while flying. Severe fatigue was reported more frequently by low-cost airline pilots than scheduled airline pilots (P = 0.05) and fatigue ratings were higher in this group (P = 0.03). Pilots who reported regularly flying into their 'discretion' hours had lower physical and psychological health, and overall fatigue scores, and poorer self-rated general health. Flying into discretion time occurred no more frequently in low-cost airline pilots than scheduled airline pilots. Conclusions: Identifiable fatigue problems are reported by short-haul pilots, but this cannot be attributed solely to the work schedules of low-cost airlines as regular use of discretion time appears to be associated with fatigue regardless of airline. © 2006 Oxford University Press.</abstract>"
2006,United States,A cognitive blueprint of collaboration in context: Distributed cognition in the psychiatric emergency department,"<title>A cognitive blueprint of collaboration in context: Distributed cognition in the psychiatric emergency department</title> <abstract>Objective: The complex cognitive processes that underlie human performance in 'messy' contexts such as critical care medicine suggest a need for a cognitive model with broad scope to support the understanding of error in such domains. The objective of this research is to characterize the cognition that underlies patient care in the domain of emergency psychiatry in order to enhance the understanding of error in this context. Methods and materials: The theoretical framework of distributed cognition has been used to study collaborative decision-making in a number of similarly complex environments such as airline cockpits and air traffic control towers. These environments share certain characteristics with the critical care domain: the work is collaborative in nature, it is supported by artifacts that can be studied directly, and the consequences of error are dire. However, the nature of the work in this domain and the artifacts used to support it are unique. The application of the theoretical constructs of distributed cognition to this context is necessary in order to characterize the collective thinking that underlies critical care. Our research uses a combination of ethnographic and interview data to derive a distributed cognitive model of the psychiatric emergency department (PED), a high volume clinical unit dealing exclusively with the acute phases of psychiatric crises. The dynamics of workflow within the department are complex: several types of clinician collaborate by forming temporary multidisciplinary teams that attach to and manage particular patients. The component members of these teams change over time. Results: Using the theoretical framework of distributed cognition, we interpreted the collected data to derive a cognitive model of the distribution of work and information flow in the PED. This modeling process has revealed several latent flaws in the system related to the underlying distribution of cognition across teams, time, space and artifacts. Conclusions: The characterization of this distribution has enhanced our understanding of the cognitive dynamics underlying error in this environment, and will serve to guide future research on error management in the ED and inform the development of context-appropriate error-management systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

2006,United States,Overcoming barriers to patient safety,"<title>Overcoming barriers to patient safety</title> <abstract>▶ The IOM Report Keeping Patients Safe outlined five trouble spots leading to patient safety concerns on nursing units: unclear unit values, the fear of punishment for errors, the lack of systematic analysis of mistakes, the complexity of the work, and inadequate teamwork. ▶ When observing high reliability organizations (HROs), like air traffic control centers or nuclear power plants, a ""culture of safety"" transcends the culture and operations to manage unexpected events in a manner that minimizes fatal errors. ▶ These organizational characteristics and actions mirror the trouble spots outlined by the IOM: clarify values, encourage and reward reporting of mistakes, consistently analyze mistakes and near misses, look for the unexpected, simplify work, minimize interruptions, commit to resilience, encourage deference to expertise, and promote teamwork. ▶ Staff can begin the practice of error reporting by asking every team member to list one error or near miss during the past month during a staff meeting. ▶ Variations from critical pathways and assessment scales can be used as a tool to look for unexpected deviations. ▶ Devices that enable efficiency, like pagers and cell phones, may actually increase interruptions and lead to higher error rates.</abstract>"
2006,United States,PTSD reactions and coping responses of American Airlines flight attendants who were former employees of Trans World Airlines: Further support of a psychological contagion effect,"<title>PTSD reactions and coping responses of American Airlines flight attendants who were former employees of Trans World Airlines: Further support of a psychological contagion effect</title> <abstract>Previous findings comparing the psychological reactions and functional coping of East Coast- and West Coast-based American Airlines (AA) flight attendants after the attacks on September 11 provide support for a psychological contagion phenomenon (Lating, Sherman, Lowry, Everly, & Peragine, 2004). The purpose of this investigation was to expand these results by creating an additional comparison group consisting of current AA flight attendants not working on either the East Coast or the West Coast and who were also previously working for Trans World Airlines (TWA) before AA took over operating authority in April 2001. As predicted, the results revealed that the rate of probable posttraumatic stress disorder for the former TWA flight attendants (15.1%) was not significantly different from the East Coast and the West Coast AA flight attendants. Moreover, there were no significant differences among the three groups on measures of life functioning, and as hypothesized, there was no difference between the West Coast-based flight crews and the former TWA flight attendants in whether they knew someone who lost his or her life in the aftermath of September 11. Health implications, including multicomponent treatment interventions, are suggested. © 2006 Oxford University Press.</abstract>"

2006,Japan,Hormonal responses of pilots to training flights: The effects of experience on apparent stress,"<title>Hormonal responses of pilots to training flights: The effects of experience on apparent stress</title> <abstract>Introduction: The levels of urinary noradrenaline (NAd), adrenaline (Ad) and salivary cortisol (Cor) were determined in student and instructor pilots during Phase 1 (training with propeller engine; PH1), and Phase 2 (training with jet engine; PH2) flight training. Methods: The subjects in PH1 were 30 students and 33 instructors, and in PH2 were 17 students and 15 instructors. Urine and saliva were collected approximately 30 min before and 20 min after the flights. The ratio (post/preflight) of the hormonal levels was calculated to compare the students with the instructors and/or PH1 with PH2. Results: In PH1, the levels of all three hormones for postflight were significantly higher than for preflight in students, and the ratios of all three hormones in students were significantly higher than in instructors. In PH2, the ratios of all three hormones for students and instructors did not differ significantly, and the ratios of Ad and Cor levels in students for PH2 were significantly lower than for PH1 (Ad: 1.64 ± 0.10 vs. 2.23 ± 0.14; Cor: 0.86 ± 0.16 vs. 1.68 ± 0.11, respectively). Conclusions: The results from PH1 clearly demonstrated that flight stress for students was significantly higher than for instructors. The ratios might be regarded as result of adaptation to flight stress in students. We conclude that the ratios of Ad and Cor levels are a good indicator of stress coping in student pilots.

2006,United States,Positive psychological outcomes of spaceflight: An empirical study,"<title>Positive psychological outcomes of spaceflight: An empirical study</title> <abstract>Introduction: Anecdotes from astronauts and cosmonauts suggest that spaceflight can be an enriching experience with enduring positive effects. These positive mental health effects may help protect flight crews from the psychological stress inherent in such high-risk missions. The goal of this study was to identify areas of personal growth likely to result from traveling in space and explore how they were patterned. Methods: We developed a Positive Effects of Being in Space (PEBS) Questionnaire, which included a section adapted from the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as well as original items addressing experiences unique to spaceflight. We sent the anonymous questionnaire to 175 astronauts and cosmonauts who had flown on at least 1 mission; completed surveys were returned by 39 individuals. Results: Every respondent had a positive reaction to being in space, the strongest of which related to the Earth's beauty and fragility. Respondents reported changes in both attitudes and behaviors. Respondents appeared to cluster into two groups based on the intensity of their reported changes. Response patterns did not vary by demographic group, number of missions flown, or total elapsed time in space. Conclusions: Overall, our findings support the idea that being in space is a meaningful experience that makes an enduring positive impression on astronauts and cosmonauts. An enhanced understanding of the salutogenic effects of space travel will contribute to the education, training, and support of future space crew-members.

2006,United States,Cutaneous psoriasis in a military flight surgeon,"<title>Cutaneous psoriasis in a military flight surgeon</title> <abstract>Cutaneous psoriasis is a common, non-infectious, hyperproliferative, papulosquamous, inflammatory skin disease whose pathogenesis is unknown. The course of psoriasis is typically chronic and unpredictable. Psoriasis can range from a small, local pathological area of skin to widespread dermatologic disease, such as generalized pustular psoriasis and erythroderma. Symptoms can range from mildly symptomatic to life threatening. Complications can range from psychological problems to systemic medical disease, such as psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment options can have adverse side effects which negatively affect multiple organ systems such as the hematological, neurological, and immunological systems. Therefore, psoriasis is a dermatologic disease that should be taken seriously in military aviation. The disease, its complications, and its therapies can interfere with concentration, mission accomplishment, the ability to operate aircraft safely, and compliance with safety equipment use. In this case report, we present the case of a naval flight surgeon who presented with inverse psoriasis and plaque psoriasis, which ultimately became well controlled with topical medications. The flight surgeon was recommended for military aeromedical waivers for psoriasis and chronic medication use. We also review the medical literature on cutaneous psoriasis, discuss its complications, and review its aeromedical implications in military aviation.

2006,United Kingdom,"No pain, no gain: pain behaviour in the armed forces.","<title>No pain, no gain: pain behaviour in the armed forces.</title> <abstract>Pain is a unique phenomenon that is difficult to express and is influenced by many different factors, including cultural expectations. A dichotomy exists within the British Armed Forces between pain being seen as necessary--the ""no pain, no gain"" view--and the opposite image of stoical service personnel who suppress their emotions--the ""roughie-toughie"" image. This dichotomy was explored through an ethnographic study of pain behaviour experienced during a training course. Pain behaviour was found to be consistent with cultural expectations and this supported the ""no pain, no gain"" perspective. Physical and psychological pain were expressed differently, reinforcing the western, scientific mind-body dichotomy. In addition, personnel frequently tried to suppress their pain and this supported the ""roughie-toughie"" philosophy. Thus, pain expression varies according to the context in which it occurs. Nurses need to be aware of this to ensure they interpret and manage their patients' pain appropriately.</abstract>"

Methods: The authors conducted a cross sectional survey on health and mental health among 1955 former and current flight attendants, using a postal questionnaire. Results: More current than former flight attendants reported self perceived health as fair to poor and psychological distress measured as a GHQ-12 score of six or more. Among current flight attendants, reporting health as fair to poor was associated with low job satisfaction (OR 1.89) and recent experiences of sexual harassment by passengers (OR 2.83). Psychological distress was associated with low job satisfaction (OR 2.38) and frequent tension with partner over childcare (OR 1.79). Conclusions: Perceived health as fair to poor and psychological distress were greater among current flight attendants and were related to job characteristics and family difficulties. Perceived poor health has been shown in the literature to be related to mortality, high job strain, and early retirement, and psychological distress is associated with work absence. The effect of sexual harassment by passengers on perceived health of flight attendants may be relevant to other working women dealing with the public. The health effects of family/work conflicts, low job satisfaction, and sexual harassment should be explored more in depth, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods among working women in various occupations.</abstract>"
2005,China - United Kingdom,Aeronautical decision making: Instructor-pilot evaluation of five Mnemonic methods,"<title>Aeronautical decision making: Instructor-pilot evaluation of five Mnemonic methods</title> <abstract>Introduction: The ability to make good decisions is a critical component of pilot proficiency. Results of recent research suggest that aeronautical decision making (ADM) can be improved by training. The purposes of this research are to identify the best ADM mnemonic-based methods for training military pilots in decision making in tactical environments. Methods: There were 60 instructor pilots in the Republic of China Air Force Academy who evaluated the suitability of 5 different ADM methods including SHOR (Stimuli, Hypotheses, Options, Response); PASS (Problem identification, Acquire information, Survey strategy, Select strategy); FOR-DEC (Facts, Options, Risks & Benefits, Decision, Execution, Check); SOAR (Situation, Options, Act, Repeat); and DESIDE (Detect, Estimate, Set safety objectives, Identify, Do, Evaluate). Each was evaluated for six different types of decisions: go/no go; recognition-primed; response selection; resource management; non-diagnostic procedural; and creative problem-solving. Results: The instructor-pilots regarded the SHOR method as the best for time-limited and critical, urgent situations, while they preferred DESIDE for knowledge-based decisions that needed more comprehensive consideration and were less time limited. Discussion: To optimize training effectiveness, it is necessary to provide instruction based around both the SHOR and DESIDE decision-making mnemonic methods to provide comprehensive instruction for coping with all situations in the demanding military aviation environment.

Objective: To compare the difference of mental health between aircrew and ground crew of army airmen and provide reference data for implementing corresponding norms. Design: Chester sampling investigation and paired design were applied. Setting: the 71687 Force of Chinese PLA, the 71521 Force of Chinese PLA, Department of Epidemiology, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA Participants: By chester sampling, 122 aircrew and 122 ground crew of one army airmen in one stationed training troop were randomized in February 2001. The pairs were made at ratio of 1:1 according to age difference less than 3 years and same sex and nationality. The investigated persons were all male, of Han and aged varied from 23 to 52 years. Methods: Cornell health questionnaire was adopted respectively in investigation of aircrew and ground crew of army airmen. The investigated persons finished and handed in questionnaire independently on the spot in manner of secretion and centralized filling-up. Cornell health questionnaire is composed of 18 sections, including 195 questions, involving 4 aspects, named somatic symptoms, medial and family history, general health and habit and mental symptoms. The total score of Cornell health questionnaire ≥ 30 indicates somatic and mental disturbance and the score of mental section ≥ 10 indicates mental disturbance, both of which are taken as the criteria in comparison of psychological health in receptors of two groups. Main outcome measures: Every factor score and total score in somatic and mental sections in Cornell health questionnaire for aircrew and ground crew. Results: The tested results of each 122 cases in either aircrew group or ground crew group entered result analysis. Evaluated results of somatic and mental symptoms in receptors of two groups: the total score was low in Cornell health questionnaire (0-14 scores), of which, the total score in aircrew group was higher than that in ground crew group (81.5% and 59.8%, P < 0.05); the score in mental section was low (0-9 scores), of which, that in aircrew group was higher remarkably than that in ground crew group (99.2% and 91.8%, P < 0.01); the score for the receptors with somatic and mental disturbance (total score ≥ 30, score in mental section ≥ 10) in aircrew group was lower than those in ground crew group (4.1% and 12.3%, P < 0.05); the score for the receptors with mental disturbance (score in mental section ≥ 10) in aircrew group was lower remarkably than ground crew group (0.8% and 8.2%, P < 0.01). For somatic section in aircrew group, except the factors of muscle, skeleton and skin, their scores were higher than those in ground crew group (P > 0.05), the scores of the rest factors were all lower than those in ground crew group, of which, the difference was significant in evaluation of factors of eye, ear, nervous system, urinary reproductive system and fatigue in comparison of two groups (P < 0.05). The score of every factor in mental section of aircrew group was lower than those in ground crew group. Except tension factor, in comparison of the rest factors in two groups, the significant difference was present (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Overall psychological health state in Cornell questionnaire of aircrew in army airmen was superior to ground crew. Aircrew still presents a part of psychological health questions, mainly in somatic section and inadaptability was the most positive response in mental section, suggesting that aircrew probably presents inadaptable phenomena.</abstract>"
2005,United States,"Visual perception, psychomotor performance, and complex motor performance during an overnight air refueling simulated flight","<title>Visual perception, psychomotor performance, and complex motor performance during an overnight air refueling simulated flight</title> <abstract>Introduction: Visual perception task, complex motor flight task, and psychomotor vigilance task performances were evaluated in U.S. Air Force pilots navigating a high-fidelity fixed wing jet simulator over 26.5 h of continuous wakefulness. Methods: Eight military pilots on flight status performed the primary task of flying a simulated 12.5-h overnight mission in an Air Refueling Part Task Trainer (ARPTT). Response omission to presentation of single- and double-light stimuli displayed in random sequence across the cockpit instrument panel was the metric used to assess choice visual perception task (CVPT) performance. Deviation from an established azimuth heading in the ARPTT during the CVPT was the flight metric used to assess complex motor performance. Speed, lapse, false start, and anticipation were the metrics used to assess psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance during crew rest periods. Results: Significant visual perceptual, complex motor, and psychomotor vigilance (speed and lapse) impairments occurred at 19 h awake in the eight-subject group. CVPT response omissions significantly correlated with ARPTT azimuth deviations at r = 0.97, and with PVT speed at r = -0.92 and lapses at r = 0.90. ARPTT azimuth deviations significantly correlated with PVT speed at r = -0.92 and lapses at r = 0.91. Conclusions: Acute sleep deprivation degrades visual perceptual, complex motor, and simple motor performance. Complex motor impairments strongly correlate with visual perceptual impairments. This research provides support for the use of visual perceptual measures as surrogates of complex motor performance in operational situations where the primary cognitive inputs are through the visual system.

2005,India,Aircrew ejection experience: Questionnaire responses from 20 survivors,"<title>Aircrew ejection experience: Questionnaire responses from 20 survivors</title> <abstract>Background: Published studies on ejection have focused predominantly on the injuries sustained by aircrew and discussed their preventive measures from an aeromedical perspective. However, studies have not discussed aircrew experiences related to ejection or how they would like to advise other aircrew to successfully handle ejection as an event. Such information can assist in designing realistic indoctrination and training programs. This study was conducted to fill gaps in our understanding of aircrew perspectives of successful ejections. Methods: Aircrew reporting to the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), Indian Air Force, for post-ejection evaluation during the period of May 2003 to January 2005 completed a questionnaire that was designed for the study. Results: A total of 20 aircrew completed this questionnaire. The mean age of the aircrew was 30.25 ± 4.45 yr. Most of them had logged more than 500 flying hours. Some aircrew described their initial moments of ejection as ""blacked out,"" ""dazed, yet conscious,"" or as ""a shock that gradually decreased."" Practicing ejection drills on the ground, being prepared at all times, making a timely decision to eject, and assuming correct posture were identified as the most important factors for success. Descriptions of ejection as an event suggest intense emotional arousal could occur following ejection. Discussion: This study provides first hand inputs into the psychological processes accompanying ejections. Such information could be very useful in understanding the critical factors that influence successful ejection. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2005,Australia - New Zealand,Pilot behaviors in the face of adverse weather: A new look at an old problem,"<title>Pilot behaviors in the face of adverse weather: A new look at an old problem</title> <abstract>Introduction: Weather-related general aviation accidents remain one of the most significant causes for concern in aviation safety. Previous studies have typically compared accident and non-accident cases. In contrast, the current study does not concentrate on occurrence outcome. Instead, the emphasis is on the different behaviors that pilots exhibit in the face of adverse weather and, by inference, on the decision-making processes that underlie those behaviors. Methods: This study compares three weather-related behaviors that reflect different levels of risk: visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions ('VFR into IMC'); precautionary landing; and other significant weather avoidance actions. Occurrence data (n = 491) were drawn from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau database of aviation occurrences, and included weather-related accidents, incidents, and 'normal operations.' Results: There were few significant differences between the three weather-related behavior groups in terms of pilot demographics, aircraft characteristics, geographic or environmental factors, or absolute flight distances. The pattern of relative flight distances (a psychological construct) was markedly different for the three groups, with pilots in the weather avoidance group being distinguished by taking timely action. Discussion: The relative distance results suggest that the mid-point of the flight can be a 'psychological turning point' for pilots, irrespective of the absolute flight distance involved. Hence, pilots' behavior was sometimes influenced by psychological factors not related to any particular operational aspect of the flight. The results of the weather avoidance group indicate that a safe pilot is a proactive pilot. Dealing with adverse weather is not a one-off decision but a continually evolving process. This aspect is discussed in terms of the concept of 'mindfulness'. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"

Symptoms are beyond voluntary control and may lead patients to avoid flying and seek medical advice. Methods: Of 1101 psychiatric files from our institute for 1985-2002, 1 50 represented cases of fliers who suffered from phobic fear of flying. Data collected from those files included assessment of fear-evoking situations, type of aircraft, class of aircrew duties, aircraft accident history, past medical history, age, and associated psychiatric comorbidity. Results: We compared a group of 56 pilots with 94 other aircrew members. Results included 143 cases of flight phobia behavior and 7 cases of anxiety about parachuting. Flight phobia was less frequent among pilots (37.4%) than the other aircrew members (62.6%). We found a history of aircraft accident to the patient or an acquaintance in 25% of the cases. Observed comorbid psychiatric disorders (54%) consisted of depressive disorders (22%), anxiety disorders (16%), and personality disorders (7.4%). Fixed-wing pilots and aircrews members had a higher incidence of depression than did rotary-wing pilots and crew-members (p < 0.05). Rotary-wing pilots and crewmembers had a higher rate of anxiety disorders (p < 0.05). Discussion: Flight phobia encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical origins that may lead pilots or other aircrew members to refuse to fly. We recommend a careful psychiatric evaluation and close follow-up to adequately diagnose fliers with flight phobic reactions, as well as establishing adequate medical and/or psychological treatment.

Two types of SMMs were expected to contribute uniquely, as well as interact, to predict tower safety and efficiency. Using SMM data from 306 air traffic controllers, and corresponding archival efficiency and safety measures for 47 airports, the authors found no significant linear relationships between SMMs and either outcome measure. However, the 2 SMMs interacted with one another to predict both outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of measuring multiple types of SMMs, the examination of complex relationships, and the importance of indexing decisions.

2005,Australia,Travel medicine: An Australian perspective,"<title>Travel medicine: An Australian perspective</title> <abstract>Travel medicine is emerging as a new multidisciplinary specialty area catering for an increasing number of travellers worldwide. Travel health advisers are engaged in the provision of pre-travel health advice, chemoprophylaxis against travel-related diseases, traveller's medical kits, and post-travel assessments and eradication treatment for various travel-related diseases. They are also in a key position to liaise with public health authorities on possible imported disease risks. In terms of risk assessment and provision of preventive measures, vector-borne diseases, in particular malaria and the arboviral diseases, stand out as major concerns for travellers, however, common problems, such as travellers' diarrhoea and respiratory tract infection, also need to be addressed. Travel and aviation medicine have many linkages, especially in terms of fitness to fly and dealing with problems that may arise in travellers due to physiological and psychological stresses of travel. In the face of recent terrorism and conflict, travel advisories have assumed great importance in travellers planning. Travel insurance remains an important safety net for travellers, which provides coverage for medical and dental treatment abroad as well as an emergency assistance service, which may include aeromedical evacuation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

2005,"Korea, Republic of",The effect of job stress and lifestyle on blood lipid levels in male aircrew personnel.,"<title>The effect of job stress and lifestyle on blood lipid levels in male aircrew personnel.</title> <abstract>INTRODUCION: Cardiovascular disease has the potential to lead to sudden in-flight incapacitation and permanent grounding. The aims of this study are to examine the relationships between lifestyle, job stress and blood lipid levels of male aircrew personnel of a Korean airline and to identify which factors influence their hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Two hundred sixteen male aircrew personnel completed a questionnaire by self-report and consented to participate in the study. The questionnaire collected data related to job stress, life style, serum cholesterol levels and general characteristics of the aircrew. The cholesterol levels of the subjects were collected from their most recent health check-up records. Subjects were divided into two groups (the desirable group and the risk group) based on their serum cholesterol level, 200 mg/dl. RESULTS: Mean age and marital status were significantly different between the two groups. More subjects in the risk group had habits of eating high lipid foods, while more subjects in the desirable group exercised more frequently than the risk group. In logistic regression analysis, after controlling age and marital status, types of working situation (domestic duty or international duty, odds ratio=.390, p=.018), diet (odds ratio=.429, p=.037), and exercise (odds ratio=.320, p=.055) were influencing factors on aircrew's serum cholesterol levels. CONCLUSIONS: The cholesterol level of aircrew personnel is closely related to their lifestyle, such as lipid diet and exercise. The type of work situations, e.g. staying in an airplane for long periods of time or staying abroad, may influence these diet patterns and exercise habits.</abstract>"

Royal Air Force health staff had a significantly higher prevalence of ill health than both the Army [12 (63%) vs 6 (23%)] and the Royal Navy [12 (63%) vs 1 (8%)]. RAF non-commissioned staff were found to have a highly significant prevalence of ill health compared to the Army non-commissioned staff [7(70%) vs 1 (7%)], and Royal Navy non-commissioned staff [7 (70%) vs 0 (0%)]. CONCLUSION: The study shows significant differences in psychological ill health between Services at the RCDM. Comparison with civilian data showed that the overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was no higher than in NHS staff. The elevated level of ill health in the Royal Air Force staff warrants further investigation and possible intervention.</abstract>"
2005,United Kingdom,Personal experience of aeromedical evacuation of patients in the Balkans.,"<title>Personal experience of aeromedical evacuation of patients in the Balkans.</title> <abstract>Nurses in the Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service (PMRAFNS) undertake a variety of different roles in providing nursing care to Armed Forces personnel wherever they may serve. One such role is the evacuation by air of sick or injured personnel. This article discusses the experience of a nurse lecturer in the PMRANS who undertook the role of aeromedical evacuation liaison officer in the Balkans for a 4-month period during winter. The role is described and details of how the aeromedical evacuation of patients was organized is presented. The benefits of evacuating patients by air are discussed along with some of the potential problems that were encountered in the Balkans, including logistical problems and the vagaries of the weather. Finally, several examples of the types of patients evacuated are presented.</abstract>"

2004,United States,PTSD reactions and coping responses of East Coast and West Coast American airlines flight attendants after September 11: A possible psychological contagion effect?,"<title>PTSD reactions and coping responses of East Coast and West Coast American airlines flight attendants after September 11: A possible psychological contagion effect?</title> <abstract>Psychological reactions and functional coping of East Coast and West Coast-based flight attendants were compared after the attacks on September 11. Demographics and standardized questionnaires were sent in June 2002 to approximately 26,000 flight attendants. The 2,050 returned surveys were separated into East Coast-based flight crews (513 from Boston, New York, and Washington, DC) and West Coast-based flight crews (353 from Los Angeles and San Francisco). Despite demographic differences between the flight crews, most notably that the East Coast members were more than twice as likely to know someone who perished in the wake of September 11, there was no difference between them regarding probable PTSD (19.1% and 18.3%, respectively) or life functioning. We suggest that a psychological contagion effect occurred in this at-risk group of workers in the war on terrorism. Public health implications, including multicomponent treatment interventions, are suggested.</abstract>"
2004,United States,The airline lifesaver: A 17-year analysis of a technique to prompt the delivery of a safety message,"<title>The airline lifesaver: A 17-year analysis of a technique to prompt the delivery of a safety message</title> <abstract>The Airline Lifesaver (AL) is a 13.3 cm×9.8 cm card any passenger can deliver to the attendant of a commercial airline in order to prompt the delivery of an important safety message. In particular, the AL requests the following safety-belt reminder be added to the regular announcements given at the end of the flight - ""Now that you have worn a seat belt for the safest part of your trip, the flight crew would like to remind you to buckle-up during your ground transportation."" Method: The AL card was handed to 1,258 flight attendants over a 17-year period and compliance with the request for the safety message was systematically tracked. Slightly more than one-third of the AL cards (n=460) included an incentive for making the announcement. Results: Without the incentive, compliance to give the buckle-up reminder was 35.5% of 798 flights. With the incentive, compliance was significantly higher (i.e., 53.3%). Impact: The validity of the AL intervention is discussed with regard to its: (a) relevance to cognitive dissonance and consistency theory, and (b) broad-based applicability as a component of community-wide efforts to facilitate a safety-focused culture. The 17-year study also demonstrated a practical and cost-effective application of a behavior-based incentive program. © 2004 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Using binary logistic regression to screen candidates for instructor pilot upgrade,"<title>Using binary logistic regression to screen candidates for instructor pilot upgrade</title> <abstract>Researchers who focus on aircrew performance and its relation to aviation safety have endeavored to understand personality traits and attributes andtheireffecton team coherence and performance. Moreover, corporate aviation departments and commercial air carriers have vested interests in hiring those applicants who have the propensity to perform effectively in a team environment. As a continuation of ongoing research in pilot resource selection, the authors have examined the efficacy of binary logistic regression in screening candidates for instructor pilot upgrade by analyzing psychological surveys of 77 commercial pilots based on the Big Five Personality Inventory, the Leadership Intelligence Quotient (LIQ) Self-Assessment and three select attribute scales (Mach V, locus-of-control, and self-monitoring scales). Results of this research indicated a significant relationship between leader decision-making and personality attributes complementing team formation. In this particular study, 36 experienced instructor pilots and 41 line pilots were categorized with an overall accuracy of 93 percent employing a two-variable model based on Machiavellian view and self-monitoring as independent or predictor variables. These results underscored the efficacy of logistic regression as a statistical methodology in human resource selection and these psychological dimensions as a means of screening pilot candidates for program assignment. The demand among commercial air carriers and corporate aviation for greater consistency and validity of aircrew resource selection methods grows continuously. In the past, the emphasis has been on evaluating technical qualifications and operational experience. There has been no shortage of applicants meeting the basic standard in these areas. The challenge today and in the future is to go beyond that stage of evaluation to develop more effective means of measuring the social aspects of the human variable in the aviation safety equation. Selection protocols are under close, continuous scrutiny and now include personality and temperament characteristics related to crew coordination and team assimilation (Chidester, 1991). Research suggested that in the past selection protocols have suffered in predictive validity with content remaining basically unchanged (Damos, 1995). These protocols in the past have indicated higher predictive validity in the training program, not in the operational environment (Damos, 1996). Effective screening of pilot candidates, whether the purpose is to identify instructor upgrades or to select hires, will improve the return on investment of sunk costs related to training (Hackman, 1993). © 2004, FAA Academy.</abstract>"
2004,Norway,Medical disqualification of 275 commercial pilots: Changing patterns over 20 years,"<title>Medical disqualification of 275 commercial pilots: Changing patterns over 20 years</title> <abstract>Introduction: The medical requirements for commercial pilots are issued by the ICAO and the European aviation safety organization JAA. In Norway, the Aeromedical Section of the Civil Aviation Authority assesses whether pilots are medically fit to fly. This study presents the reasons for medical disqualification among the Norwegian commercial pilot population during a 20-yr period. Methods: Files on all disqualified commercial pilots were reviewed and subdivided into age groups and diagnostic categories. Different disqualification rates were calculated. Results: From the study population of 48,229 pilot-years, 275 pilots were permanently grounded, which gives a 20-yr average disqualification rate of 5.7 per 1,000 pilot-years. Discussion and Conclusions: For cardiovascular diseases the disqualification rate was lower after 1997 than before, which is explained by improved treatment and more lenient requirements. In the diagnostic categories, neurology, musculoskeletal, and psychiatric diseases, the disqualification rate increased after 1997. This fact is probably not attributed to more stringent health requirements, but possibly to the attitudes of the pilots, who have become more critical with respect to their subjective perception of their working environment and psychosocial factors.</abstract>"

Methods: Assessments in 1974 to 1978 included physical examinations and recordings (every 20 minutes for 5 hours) of both workload (planes within controller airspace) and blood pressure reactivity. Individual differences in reactivity were used to predict 1994 self-report of ever having been told by a physician to take antihypertensive medication, assessed in a telephone survey of 218 respondents who were normotensive or stage 1 hypertensive in 1974 to 1978. Results: Each SD increase in baseline systolic reactivity was associated with a 1.7 (p < .019) increase in the relative-odds of 1994 hypertension, after controlling for age, body mass index, and clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure at clinical examination, with effects comparable for baseline normotensives and stage I hypertensives. Conclusion: A 20-year follow-up of originally normotensive and stage I hypertensive workers suggests that increased systolic blood pressure reactivity to work stress is associated with long-term risk of hypertension.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Verification of the change blindness phenomenon while managing critical events on a combat information display,"<title>Verification of the change blindness phenomenon while managing critical events on a combat information display</title> <abstract>Change blindness occurs when humans are unable to detect significant changes in objects and scenes after their attention is momentarily diverted. Because change blindness is relevant in many applied settings, the current study investigated the phenomenon in the context of tasks performed by naval command and control system personnel. Operators of such systems are often heavily loaded with concurrent visual search, situation assessment, voice communications, and control-display manipulation tasks at large, physically dispersed tactical situation displays. As the operators' attention shifts from one display to another, it creates an opportunity for changes to occur on unattended screens with potentially negative consequences. Our results show that on a display containing 8 objects of interest, considerable change blindness was demonstrated in that participants required 2 or more selections to correctly identify a changed object on nearly 1/3 of the test trials. Further, operator performance on 15% of the trials was equivalent to randomly guessing with replacement after making 3 incorrect selections. This research underscores the need for developing effective countermeasures to the change blindness phenomenon. Actual or potential uses of this research include interface design of computer workstations for military, nuclear power industry, air traffic control, crisis response center, and hospital emergency room applications.</abstract>"
2004,United States,PTSD reactions and functioning of American Airlines flight attendants in the wake of September 11,"<title>PTSD reactions and functioning of American Airlines flight attendants in the wake of September 11</title> <abstract>The authors explore the psychological reactions and functional coping responses of American Airlines (AA) flight attendants, a unique at-risk group of people in the war on terrorism, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Demographic characteristics and standardized questionnaires, including the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist and the Psychotherapy Outcome Assessment and Monitoring System-Trauma Version, were sent in June 2002 to approximately 26,000 AA flight attendants. Of the 2050 respondents, 18.2% reported symptoms consistent with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Those living alone were 1.48 times more likely to have a probable PTSD diagnosis than those living with someone else. Age or years of service as a flight attendant did not predict probable PTSD; however, marital status did. Substance abuse was not endorsed as a coping strategy. Given the traumatic events experienced by AA flight attendants, and persistent threats of future terrorist attacks, these results reveal that additional assessment and treatment interventions for stress-related symptoms in this population seem warranted.</abstract>"

The authors used multilevel analysis to investigate relationships at within- and between-person levels of analysis. Participants were given multiple trials of practice on an air traffic control task. Measures of effort intensity and performance were taken at repeated intervals. As expected, the relationship between effort and performance increased with practice. Furthermore, the rate at which this effect strengthened was faster for individuals with high-ability or low-performance orientation. There was also an interaction between learning and performance orientations that only emerged after practice. By the end of practice, the negative effects of performance orientation were stronger for individuals with high learning orientation. Results highlight the importance of adopting a multilevel framework to enhance understanding of the link between motivation and performance.</abstract>"
2004,Norway - United States,Personality Characteristics and Trait Clusters in Final Stage Astronaut Selection,"<title>Personality Characteristics and Trait Clusters in Final Stage Astronaut Selection</title> <abstract>Introduction: This paper presents personality testing data from final stage applicants to the NASA astronaut program. Questions addressed include whether personality predicted final selection into the astronaut corps, whether women and men demonstrated typical gender differences in personality, and whether three characteristic clusters found in other high performance populations replicated in this group. Methods: Between 1989 and 1995, 259 final stage astronauts completed the Personal Characteristic Inventory (PCI) which assesses personality characteristics related to the broad traits of Instrumentality and Expressivity. In addition, 147 of these individuals also completed an abbreviated version of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) which assesses the ""Big Five"" traits of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, And Conscientiousness. Results: Three previously identified trait clusters (Right, Wrong, and No Stuff) were found to replicate in this population. No differences were found on the PCI or on the modified NEO-FFI between applicants who were chosen to become astronauts (n = 63) and those who were not (n = 196). Men scored higher than women on competitiveness, but lower on expressivity and achievement strivings. Discussion: These analyses suggest that the ""Right Stuff,"" ""Wrong Stuff"" and ""No Stuff"" clusters originally described in airline pilots and other high performance groups also exist within this population. Consistent with findings from other high performance populations, men and women tend to differ to a lesser extent than found in the general population, particularly on traits related to achievement motivation. Personality trait testing did not predict which applicants were most likely to be accepted into the astronaut corps.</abstract>"
2004,France,Mental Workload in Air Traffic Control: An Index Constructed from Field Tests,"<title>Mental Workload in Air Traffic Control: An Index Constructed from Field Tests</title> <abstract>Background: Mental workload assessment is a recurrent issue in air traffic control (ATC). Studies of ATC have used either objective aspects, i.e., numbers and distribution of aircraft, or subjective factors, such as self-imposed performance and stress levels, with mixed results. This is partly due to the difficulty in bringing together comparable data pertaining to both air traffic, with its ever-changing distribution, and judgement or quickly fluctuating psychophysiological variables. Methods: We propose a method of mental load estimation devised to take into account both objective traffic variables and the additional load imposed by subjective effects, including the seriousness of conflicts and the time-pressure for their resolution. First, we developed a traffic load index (TLI) to identify time boundaries during which additional load may occur. Then we quantified the additional load according to the air traffic situation. Results: TLI was developed from analysis of 25 h of recordings of radar control sessions involving 25 professional air traffic controllers at a major airport. Results were then compared with a simple objective index (number of aircraft) and subjective workload ratings (NASA-TLX test). The whole population (intersubjects analysis) showed a better correlation between the TLI and the self-rated workload than for the number of aircraft alone. Among the controllers who rated more than one level of workload through the TLX-test, 77.8% showed better correlation between TLI and TLX than between N and TLX (intrasubjects analysis). Conclusion: Workload estimation should integrate both objective task variables and subjective evaluations associated with them.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Distributed interactive communication in simulated space-dwelling groups,"<title>Distributed interactive communication in simulated space-dwelling groups</title> <abstract>This report describes the development and preliminary application of an experimental test bed for modeling human behavior in the context of a computer generated environment to analyze the effects of variations in communication modalities, incentives and stressful conditions. In addition to detailing the methodological development of a simulated task environment that provides for electronic monitoring and recording of individual and group behavior, the initial substantive findings from an experimental analysis of distributed interactive communication in simulated space dwelling groups are described. Crews of three members each (male and female) participated in simulated ""planetary missions"" based upon a synthetic scenario task that required identification, collection, and analysis of geologic specimens with a range of grade values. The results of these preliminary studies showed clearly that cooperative and productive interactions were maintained between individually isolated and distributed individuals communicating and problem-solving effectively in a computer-generated ""planetary"" environment over extended time intervals without benefit of one another's physical presence. Studies on communication channel constraints confirmed the functional interchangeability between available modalities with the highest degree of interchangeability occurring between Audio and Text modes of communication. The effects of task-related incentives were determined by the conditions under which they were available with Positive Incentives effectively attenuating decrements in performance under stressful time pressure. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2004,Italy - Romania,Integrating qualitative methods into occupational health research: A study of women flight attendants,"<title>Integrating qualitative methods into occupational health research: A study of women flight attendants</title> <abstract>Aims: To identify possible work related sources of psychosocial stress in order to develop pertinent questionnaire items for a cross-sectional health survey of 3000 Italian women flight attendants, and to solicit suggestions on improving survey participation. Methods: Qualitative study in which 26 current and former women flight attendants participated: three focus groups of 6-7 participants each and six in-depth individual interviews. The session themes included positive and negative aspects of the job; relationships with colleagues, superiors, and passengers; perception of occupational risk for serious diseases; compatibility of work and family; and experiences of work related sources of stress and their effect on health. A transcript based analysis of the focus groups and interviews was used to identify emerging themes related to risk factors for mental health problems. Results: The participants indicated that mental health was a major concern. Several work related risk factors possibly related to adverse outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, were highlighted. These included isolation and solitude, fears of being inadequate partners and mothers due to job demands, passenger relationships, and lack of protection by employers with respect to workplace exposures and violent passengers. The information gained was used to develop a mental health module for inclusion in the health survey questionnaire which included questions on history of severe depression or anxiety, suicidal ideation or attempt, substance abuse, workplace sexual harassment, social support, leisure time activities, relationship with a partner, and role as mother. Conclusions: Employing qualitative methods to identify work related sources of psychosocial stress enabled development of pertinent questionnaire items for a cross-sectional epidemiological study of women flight attendants. Follow up qualitative research may be necessary in order to put the cross-sectional study findings into context and to explore actions or strategies for preventing work related health problems evidenced from the survey.</abstract>"
2004,Lithuania,Occupational health problems in modern work environment.,"<title>Occupational health problems in modern work environment.</title> <abstract>Analysis of occupational health problems in Lithuania and their relation to factors of modern work environment is presented. The article analyses the health of transport workers, airlines pilots and stewards, video display terminal workers and its relation to work environment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and evaluate influence of changing occupational environment to workers' health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Complex evaluation including several enterprises with different work profile and conditions. Evaluation of work environment, assessment of psychophysiological and ophthalmological data of workers as well as morbidity studies were performed. RESULTS: Occupational environment of transport workers is related with high levels of noise, vibration, mercury, carbon monoxide, welding aerosols, and dust. Main diseases for transport workers are upper respiratory tract and lung diseases, accidents, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders. Cases of temporal morbidity for pilots and stewards are upper respiratory tract and lung diseases, accidents, intoxications and nervous system diseases. The main effects of video display terminal on operators' health are vision fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders. Ophthalmologic symptoms and vision fatigue are related to changes in eyes and central nervous system fatigue, as well as syndrome of ""dry eyes"". CONCLUSIONS: Changeable work environment is affecting employees' health with specific changes, which depend upon work character, experience and worker's age.</abstract>"
2004,Germany,Nocturnal aircraft noise effects,"<title>Nocturnal aircraft noise effects</title> <abstract>Noise protection associated with the construction and extension of airports in the Federal Republic of Germany has been regulated by the law for protection against aircraft noise since 1971. This legislation is due for revision because of different aspects. One aspect is the growth of air traffic which has led many airports to the limits of their capacity and in search of new ways of adaptation to the increasing demand for flight services. Another aspect is the increasing concern of the population about noise effects which has to be addressed by better protection against the effects of aircraft noise. The framework conditions of policy in terms of society as a whole, its health and economic environment need to be put into effect by political action. Science can contribute to this goal by performing noise effects research and by providing recommendations to the political body. However, it remains controversial, what measures are necessary or adequate to assure effective protection of the population against aircraft noise. This is particularly true for the protection of rest and sleep at night. The problem of finding a common basis for adequate recommendations is associated with (1) the low number of primary studies, which also exhibited highly variable results and assessments, (2) the handling of acoustic or psycho-acoustic dimensions for quantifying psychological or physiological reactions, and (3) the conception of how far preventive measures have to go to prove effective. With this in mind, the DLR Institute for Aerospace Medicine is conducting a large-scale, multi-stage study for investigating the acute effects of nocturnal aircraft noise on human sleep. This enterprise is implemented in the framework of the HGF/DLR project ""Quiet Air Traffic"" for developing sustainable assessment criteria for human-specific effects of aircraft noise at night.</abstract>"
2004,Italy,The Italian Air Force rehabilitation programme for air-sickness.,"<title>The Italian Air Force rehabilitation programme for air-sickness.</title> <abstract>Motion Sickness, or kinetosis, is a complex clinical syndrome usually classified according to the environmental situation evoking the symptoms. Among the various forms of motion sickness, air sickness has a significant impact on aircrew readiness and is often a cause for the grounding of aircrew. Unfortunately, standards for clinical testing to accurately predict the sensitivity of each individual to air-sickness are currently lacking. Furthermore, pharmacological prevention is contraindicated for aircrews, whose cognitive tasks involve a high level of vigilance. Therefore, a number of Air Forces have developed their own rehabilitation programmes to counteract air-sickness effects on flight personnel. These programmes may differ in several aspects, such as their duration, instruments used, costs and the technical characteristics of the rehabilitation team. However, reports in the specialized literature, refer to high rates of success, despite the above-mentioned differences. In the autumn of 2000, the Italian Air Force (ITAF) also began its own rehabilitation programme for air-sickness desensitisation. The programme was developed at the Aerospace Medicine Department of the ITAF Flight Test Centre, at the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base, Italy. The ITAF rehabilitation course lasts two weeks, and candidates are first classified according to their clinical history and to their reaction to the Coriolis Stress Test. Thereafter, subjects undergo a personalized desensitisation programme, involving increasingly more intense nauseogenic stimuli by means of various devices. At the same time, a psychological approach, based on autogenous training and cognitive-behavioural therapy, is adopted. The present report refers to data from 17 subjects treated from January 2001. The current clinical outcome is extremely encouraging, with a success rate of 88%. Nevertheless, several aspects of motion sickness rehabilitation are still under investigation, and further research programmes, aimed at improving the final clinical outcome and prolonging the benefits of rehabilitation, are needed.</abstract>"
2004,Germany,CAMS as a tool for human factors research in spaceflight,"<title>CAMS as a tool for human factors research in spaceflight</title> <abstract>The paper reviews a number of research studies that were carried out with a PC-based task environment called Cabin Air Management System (CAMS) simulating the operation of a spacecraft's life support system. As CAMS was a multiple task environment, it allowed the measurement of performance at different levels. Four task components of different priority were embedded in the task environment: diagnosis and repair of system faults, maintaining atmospheric parameters in a safe state, acknowledgement of system alarms (reaction time), and keeping a record of critical system resources (prospective memory). Furthermore, the task environment permitted the examination of different task management strategies and changes in crew member state (fatigue, anxiety, mental effort). A major goal of the research programme was to examine how crew members adapted to various forms of sub-optimal working conditions, such as isolation and confinement, sleep deprivation and noise. None of the studies provided evidence for decrements in primary task performance. However, the results showed a number of adaptive responses of crew members to adjust to the different sub-optimal working conditions. There was evidence for adjustments in information sampling strategies (usually reductions in sampling frequency) as a result of unfavourable working conditions. The results also showed selected decrements in secondary task performance. Prospective memory seemed to be somewhat more vulnerable to sub-optimal working conditions than performance on the reaction time task. Finally, suggestions are made for future research with the CAMS environment. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2003,"Korea, Republic of",A study on the student pilot's mental workload due to personality types of both instructor and student,"<title>A study on the student pilot's mental workload due to personality types of both instructor and student</title> <abstract>The main purpose of this paper is to provide the ideal flight crew combination for instructor and student pilots in order to enhance the flight training effects based on Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) theory. In addition to personality, various levels of flight difficulty are considered in order to investigate their potential interaction effect in terms of student pilots' mental workload measured in heart rate, altitude deviation, NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) and subjective degree of personality harmony. Based on an experiment performed in a real flight situation, we found significant effects of personality combinations in terms of all four outcome measures. Both group C types of instructors and students who are concrete, realistic and have mechanical skills turn out to be the ideal flight crew combination. A structural equation model, fitted to analyse causality among the four response variables, implied that as the heart rate increased, the altitude deviation increased. In addition, as the altitude deviation and personality harmony increased, NASA-TLX increased. The results of this study are expected to provide a theoretical basis for manning the flight crew combinations and thereby enhancing the efficiency of flight training.</abstract>"

Anecdotal reports have indicated Dexedrine (Dex) is effective in ""real world"" sustained operations, and controlled laboratory tests have yielded positive results as well. The aim of this study was to substantiate the efficacy of Dex for sustaining the alertness and performance of pilots during periods of sleep deprivation by showing the robust effects of the medication and its consistent effects across several research efforts. Methods: In the present report, selected data from several controlled aviation studies were reviewed and combined to corroborate the efficacy of Dex as a fatigue countermeasure. Results: The results showed Dex to be effective for maintaining flight skills, psychological mood, and physiological activation (measured via electroencephalograph data) in sleep-deprived pilots. The positive benefits of the medication were not offset by marked disruptions in recovery sleep, although some negative effects were observed (sleep was lighter for several hours following drug administration). Conclusions: Dex is a viable remedy for fatigue in aviation sustained operations. However, Dex is not a substitute for proper crew-rest scheduling because there is no replacement for adequate restful sleep.</abstract>"
2003,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",The relief of anxiety: Comparative study - Air plane flying vs anesthesia,"<title>The relief of anxiety: Comparative study - Air plane flying vs anesthesia</title> <abstract>Background: Airplane Flying and anesthesia are both not entirely safe. Passengers and patients have the right not to be endangered during flight or anesthesia. Flying and anesthesia has always been associated with anxiety in passengers and patients. Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the anxiety between passengers to fly and patients to receive anesthesia. Methods: One hundred and eighty persons were randomly selected and divided into six equal groups. Pilots and flight crew; anesthetist, resident of anesthesiology and nurse anesthetists; people who had flown but without any history of anesthesia; people without any experience of flight or anesthesia; people with previous experiences of both the flight and anesthesia and finally people with a previous history of anesthesia but without any experience of flight as Groups 1 to 6 respectively. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the level of anxiety during both the flight and anesthesia. Results: All six groups had significantly more anxiety from anesthesia than flying (p<0.05) except in group 5 (p = 0.460). Anxiety of flying was significantly less in pilots and flight crews (group 1) when compared with other groups (p<0.004). The anxiety of anesthesia was significantly less in anesthetist team when compared with those who has not experienced general anesthesia. People who had not experienced anesthesia showed more fear about anesthesia than those who had experienced general anesthesia (p<0.002). Conclusion: The results showed that having enough information about flying causes less anxiety just as preoperative visits help the patient to undergo a more comfortable anesthesia.</abstract>"
2003,"Taiwan, Province of China",Inflight workload assessment: Comparison of subjective and physiological measurements,"<title>Inflight workload assessment: Comparison of subjective and physiological measurements</title> <abstract>Introduction: Assessment of pilot workload during flight is an important aviation safety consideration. The aim of this study was to assess inflight pilot workload using both physiological and multidimensional subjective-ratings measurements (heart rate and NASA Task Load Index, respectively), comparing relative sensitivity during the four phases of flight: take-off, cruise, approach, and landing. Methods: Ten male pilots volunteered to participate in the trials, which took place in a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator. Electrocardiography was performed throughout the test using the portable Cardiovis ECG system. Mean heart rate (HR) and incremental heart rate (ΔHR) were considered indices of physiological workload. Results: Peak HR was observed during take-off (83.2 bpm) and landing (88.6 bpm); moreover, ΔHR was also greatest (14.2 bpm and 18.8 bpm). The Task Load Index (TLX) scale revealed that mental and performance demands were essential components of workload during flight. In addition, temporal demand was an important component of workload during take-off and physical demand was significant during cruise. Analysis of correlation revealed that the ΔHR is significantly related to TLX scores (r = 0.81, n = 40). Conclusions: Management of the individual sources of stress, which tend to become predominant during different flight phases, should be emphasized in periodic recurrent training. For example, a pilot must be trained to cope with the increased temporal stresses associated with take-off. In addition, the recommendations will be concerned with maintaining vigilance, task allocation between pilots, and inflight rest during long-haul cruise.</abstract>"
2003,Germany,Securing future ATM-concepts' safety by measuring situation awaerness in ATC,"<title>Securing future ATM-concepts' safety by measuring situation awaerness in ATC</title> <abstract>A radical change in air traffic management (ATM) is required. New concepts implemented with a view to increasing capacity and efficiency should at least be safety-neutral. Because of the enormous impact of the introduction of new air traffic management systems, their basic concepts have to be evaluated prospectively. With the increasing automation during the nineties, the concept of situation awareness (SA) became accepted as a potential indicator for safety. Among the considerable number of methods that have been developed to measure SA, no method has been validated or applied to evaluate future ATM-concepts like the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The approach of SAGAT is based on the assumption that the set of task environments' elements that are relevant for SA is independent of the dynamics within the task environment. Empirical evidence was found that this assumption can not be held in the ATC-domain. A new method to measure SA in ATC, called SALSA, has been developed. This measure takes into account that air traffic controllers use an event based mental representation of the air traffic. The SALSA and the SAGAT SA-measure have been compared in an evaluation study of a new ATM-concept. Results indicate that the method SALSA is feasible and more suitable than SAGAT to evaluate prospectively future ATM-concepts with regards to their impact on safety. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

2003,United States,Effects of Deliberate Practice on Crisis Decision Performance,"<title>Effects of Deliberate Practice on Crisis Decision Performance</title> <abstract>This study examined the impact of deliberate practice on pilot decision making in once-in-a-career crisis decision scenarios. First we explored the impact of deliberate practice on pilot decision-making performance for crisis flying scenarios that had been practiced in their entirety. Then we looked at the impact of deliberate practice in which one aspect of the crisis scenario - the particular malfunction - was unpracticed. We analyzed pilot decision-making performance in response to 160 airborne mechanical malfunctions. We initially found that deliberate practice significantly improves decision-making performance for wholly practiced crises but does not improve decision-making performance when the specific malfunction has not been practiced. We then split decision making for each crisis into two phases: assessment and action selection. For wholly practiced crisis scenarios, additional deliberate practice positively impacts each decision-making phase. However, for part-practiced scenarios, deliberate practice appears to differentially affect phase of error. Specifically, pilots with more deliberate practice erred in action selection, whereas less-practiced pilots erred in assessment. Actual or potential applications of this research include training proscriptions for crisis decision making.</abstract>"

Data from 7 air traffic controllers were used to train and test artificial neural network and stepwise discriminant classifiers. Very high levels of classification accuracy were achieved by both classifiers. When the 2 task difficulty manipulations were tested separately, the percentage correct classifications were between 84% and 88%. Feature reduction using saliency analysis for the artificial neural networks resulted in a mean of 90% correct classification accuracy. Considering the data as a 2-class problem, acceptable load versus overload, resulted in almost perfect classification accuracies, with mean percentage correct of 98%. In applied situations, the most important distinction among operator functional states would be to detect mental overload situations. These results suggest that psychophysiological data are capable of such discriminations with high levels of accuracy. Potential applications of this research include test and evaluation of new and modified systems and adaptive aiding.</abstract>"
2003,United States,Are pilots at risk of accidents due to fatigue?,"<title>Are pilots at risk of accidents due to fatigue?</title> <abstract>Problem: There is concern in the aviation community that pilot schedules can lead to fatigue and increased chance of an aviation accident. Yet despite this concern, there is little empirical analysis showing the relationship between pilot schedules and commercial aviation accidents. This study attempts to demonstrate an empirical relationship between pilot schedules and aviation accidents. Method: Data for human factors-related accidents and pilot work patterns were identified. The distribution of pilot work schedule parameters for the accidents was compared to that for all pilots using a chi-square test to determine if the proportions of accidents and length of duty exposure were the same. If the distributions are the same, then one could infer that pilot human factor accidents are not affected by work schedule parameters. Results: The proportion of accidents associated with pilots having longer duty periods is higher than the proportion of longer duty periods for all pilots. Discussion: There is a discernible pattern of increased probability of an accident as duty time increases for commercial aircraft pilots in the United States. Impact on Industry: The analysis suggests that establishing limits on duty time for commercial pilots would reduce risk. Such a rule is likely to be expensive and could substantially impact the commercial airlines. In return, there is likely to be a reduction in the risk of commercial aviation accidents due to pilot fatigue. © 2003 National Safety Council and Elsevier Science Ltd.

The major observation programs of JARE-42 were as follows : Upper Atmospheric Physics-observations using Fabry-Perot imager, sodium Lidar and HF/MF radar; Atmospheric Sciences and Glaciology-aerosols and air sampling, and shallow ice core drilling; Geophysics-superconducting gravity measurement, geodetic VLBI observations, and natural earthquake monitoring; Biology and Medicine-photosynthesis under sea water, populations census of penguins, and physiological and psychological adaptation to Antarctic environment, etc. In addition, satellite data receiving from ERS-2 and NOAA were also performed by using multi-purpose antenna at Syowa Station. Field activities included air sampling by using an aircraft, biological and geophysical observations, and reconnaissance survey for a possible aircraft runway around Syowa Station. Three inland traverse parties were organized, in which fuel transportation, maintenance of Dome Fuji Station, and various glaciological and geophysical observations were performed. A great efforts were made to maintain the facilities at Syowa Station by logistic personnel including mechanical engineers, radio operators, chefs, medical doctors, aircraft pilots and an engineer, an environmental engineer, a carpenter, a field assistant, a cinematographer, a satellite engineer, and an administrative officer. They were also involved in the support of field activities.</abstract>"
2003,United States,Job stress among female flight attendants,"<title>Job stress among female flight attendants</title> <abstract>We evaluated the presence of chronic job stressors among flight attendants (FAs) to examine the relationships between these job stressors and psychological distress and job dissatisfaction. Seventy-three female FAs (90% participation) employed at two commercial airlines completed a detailed questionnaire. Standard questions and scale measures were used to assess job stressors, psychological distress, and job dissatisfaction. The association between job stressors and these outcomes was evaluated using multiple regression analysis. Except for fatigue, distress and job dissatisfaction were moderate to low. Job stressors were found to have a substantive effect on these outcomes, following adjustment for individual factors. Despite moderate-to-low levels of distress and dissatisfaction, targeted efforts to reduce selected job stressors and to enhance social support may be important steps toward improving the well-being and satisfaction of FAs.</abstract>"
2003,Norway,Effects of wearing aircrew protective clothing on physiological and cognitive responses under various ambient conditions,"<title>Effects of wearing aircrew protective clothing on physiological and cognitive responses under various ambient conditions</title> <abstract>Heat stress can be a significant problem for pilots wearing protective clothing during flights, because they provide extra insulation which prevents evaporative heat loss. Heat stress can influence human cognitive activity, which might be critical in the flying situation, requiring efficient and error-free performance. This study investigated the effect of wearing protective clothing under various ambient conditions on physiological and cognitive performance. On several occasions, eight subjects were exposed for 3 h to three different environmental conditions; 0°C at 80% RH, 23°C at 63% RH and 40°C at 19% RH. The subjects were equipped with thermistors, dressed as they normally do for flights (including helmet, two layers of underwear and an uninsulated survival suit). During three separate exposures the subjects carried out two cognitive performance tests (Vigilance test and DG test). Performance was scored as correct, incorrect, missed reaction and reaction time. Skin temperature, deep body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, temperature and humidity inside the clothing, sweat loss, subjective sensation of temperature and thermal comfort were measured. Rises in rectal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate and body water loss indicated a high level of heat stress in the 40°C ambient temperature condition in comparison with 0°C and 23°C. Performance of the DG test was unaffected by ambient temperature. However, the number of incorrect reactions in the Vigilance test was significantly higher at 40°C than at 23°C (p = 0.006) or 0°C (p = 0.03). The effect on Vigilance performance correlated with changes in deep-body temperature, and this is in accordance with earlier studies that have demonstrated that cognitive performance is virtually unaffected unless environmental conditions are sufficient to change deep body temperature.</abstract>"

2003,Italy,Nutritional concerns and possible countermeasures to nutritional issues related to space flight,"<title>Nutritional concerns and possible countermeasures to nutritional issues related to space flight</title> <abstract>The experience obtained in astronauts until now has revealed many nutritional problems during both short- and longterm missions that are still under investigation. When the manned space program evolves to the point where it involves a considerable number of people operating at great distances from the Earth for long periods of time, continuous provision of food as well as physiopathological modifications partly related to nutrition will remain a challenge. Human space missions have outlined the importance of the diet on the quality of an astronaut's life, not only because an appropriate nutritional status can be maintained only through an adequate nutrient intake, but also because food plays an important socio-psychological role. A great amount of research has been done both by the Russian and American teams in order to identify the nutritional requirements for humans during space flights. Crew members should be provided with nutritional adequate diets characterized by many different food items carefully selected according to technological techniques aimed to ensure long shelflife periods, health, safety, satisfaction and convenience. An astronaut's nutritional status is greatly influenced by important weightlessness, environmental physiological adaptations. Changes in muscle and bone mass, modifications of gastro-intestinal functions and immune alterations may be partly limited by adequate planned dietary countermeasures.</abstract>"
2003,United States,Adaptation-innovation theory of cognitive style in aviation,"<title>Adaptation-innovation theory of cognitive style in aviation</title> <abstract>This article lends further credence to the important role psychology plays generally in education, and particularly in curriculum design. One basic dimension of personality is cognitive style, which influences virtually every aspect of human life. This article deals with Adaption-Innovation (A-l) theory of cognitive style, which is one of many ways to measure style and does so on a continuum from highly adaptive to highly innovative style preferences. In this aviation education application of A-l theory, it was found that aircraft pilots and pilot trainees had a distinct cognitive style preference in that they were a fairly adaptive group when compared to population norms. This fact has implications for curricular design which are discussed herein. © 2003, FAA Academy.</abstract>"
2003,Norfolk Island - United States,The Effects of leadership style and primary task workload on team performance and Follower satisfaction,"<title>The Effects of leadership style and primary task workload on team performance and Follower satisfaction</title> <abstract>Previous research has indicated that the majority of errors made in aircraft cockpits are the result of faulty information transfer among members of the flight crew. This study examined the problem by manipulating leadership style and studying its effects on performance and satisfaction under conditions of high and low workload. The participants in this study were Old Dominion graduate and undergraduate psychology students between the ages of 18 to 42. Forty-one dyads reacted to true and false alarms while performing a primary psychomotor task. After the dyads completed the experiment, the researchers administered a survey to collect data about copilots' ratings of worker satisfaction. Statistical analysis revealed that dyads in the participative leadership condition reacted to the alarms significantly more appropriately than those in the autocratic condition did, and that participants in the low workload group reset primary task gauges significantly faster than those in the high workload group. The post experimental survey indicated that, in general, copilots were more satisfied with participative leadership. Also, copilots in the low workload group reported significantly more successful team interaction. The survey and alarm reaction appropriateness results could warrant training pilots to exercise participative leadership in times of task ambiguity. © 2003, FAA Academy.</abstract>"
2003,Japan - United States,Group dynamics and catecholamines during long duration confinement in an isolated environment,"<title>Group dynamics and catecholamines during long duration confinement in an isolated environment</title> <abstract>Introduction: The objectives of this study were to investigate possible relationships between catecholamine excretion and long-duration confinement in an isolated environment. Methods: Stays of long duration were made by Group I (n = 4, all Russian, weeks 1-34), Group II (n = 4, mixed nationality, weeks 3-18), and Group III (n = 4, mixed nationality, weeks 22-38); other groups joined the residents for 1-wk intervals at weeks #13, #19, and #33. Data were collected from Groups I and III. Results: In both Group I and Group III, the daily epinephrine excretion was significantly elevated during and after confinement compared with the pre-isolation baseline (p < 0.05), but remained mostly within normal limits during the experiment. During isolation, epinephrine excretion was significantly higher, compared with other weeks in isolation, during weeks #19 and #27 for Group I, and during week #30 for Group III. In both Group I and Group III, norepinephrine excretion increased significantly during and after isolation (p < 0.05) and was above the normal range. The daily norepinephrine excretion was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Group I during weeks #12, #13, and #27, and during week #30 for Group III. Discussion: Epinephrine excretion generally remained in the normal range. However, occasional elevations occurred due to psychological stress, which apparently correlate with changes in group dynamics. Norepinephrine excretion was above the normal range and was correlated with social events. These results suggest that to ensure optimum crew performance, entire crews along with their visiting crews should be selected collectively, rather than individually.</abstract>"
2003,Germany,Elevated bilirubin and visual perception in pilots,"<title>Elevated bilirubin and visual perception in pilots</title> <abstract>Background: A fatal aircraft accident of a Bo-105 helicopter on May 20, 1996 led to the suspicion that the pilot's raised serum bilirubin level could have contributed to the accident. It was suspected that an increase of bilirubin beyond 20.52 μmol · L-1 could disturb visual perception. Methods: In 1998 and 1999, 101 pilots with functional hyperbilirubinemia, diagnosed as Gilbert's syndrome, were subjected to perceptual-psychological testing (signal detection test) during their periodic medical examinations at the German Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. The results of the psychophysiological testing were compared with a control group. Results: Reaction time and perception range increased with age and were independent of serum bilirubin level. Conclusion: There is no evidence that raised serum bilirubin levels can diminish visual perceptional performance.</abstract>"
2003,Greece,Acute effects of nicotine withdrawal syndrome in pilots during flight,"<title>Acute effects of nicotine withdrawal syndrome in pilots during flight</title> <abstract>Background: Pilots who smoke are occasionally obliged to abstain from nicotine intake during flight and may during this period exhibit certain symptoms leading to performance decrement. Methods: We studied 20 healthy male aviators, who were regular smokers, (mean age 33.7 ± 1.4 yr) operating military fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft (C-47 Dakota, F-16, A. Bell 205). All pilots were subjected to a 12-h abstinence from cigarette smoking, during which time they performed flight duties. After landing, we studied the intensity of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome, as well as its effect on physiological parameters, psychological functions, and cognitive tasks. This was achieved by the completion of a questionnaire, measurement of BP and heart rate, and the execution of certain computerized performance assessment tests. These tests measure mental arithmetic, visual vigilance, and image free-recall. In a subsequent flight performed under similar conditions, every pilot repeated the procedure without smoking deprivation. Thus, each subject served as his own control. The Wilcoxon non-parametric test was applied for statistical analysis. Results: The most frequent symptoms reported during nicotine deprivation were nervousness, craving for tobacco, tension-anxiety, fatigue, difficulty in concentration, decrease in alertness, disorders of fine adjustments, prolonged reaction times, angerirritability, drowsiness, increase in appetite, and impairment of judgement. Systolic BP and heart rate tended to decrease and diastolic BP tended to rise during withdrawal, although the differences were not statistically significant. Finally, all tests recorded an impairment of cognitive functions during abstinence. Conclusion: Abrupt cessation of smoking may be detrimental to flight safety and the smoking withdrawal syndrome may influence flying parameters.</abstract>"
2003,Netherlands,Cognitive coping and anxiety symptoms among people who seek help for fear of flying,"<title>Cognitive coping and anxiety symptoms among people who seek help for fear of flying</title> <abstract>Introduction: Fear of flying among potential passengers is rather common. In order to treat fear of flying most efficiently, it is important to find out which aspects are related to flight anxiety. The objective of the present study was to examine the extent to which various cognitive coping strategies in response to a flight were used by airline passengers and their relationship with anxiety symptoms. Method: A total of 261 persons who were all seeking treatment for fear of flying filled in the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the anxiety subscales of the Symptom Check List (SCL-90), the Flight Anxiety Situations questionnaire, and the Flight Anxiety Modality questionnaire. Results: Respondents reported using refocus on planning, rumination, putting into perspective to the highest extent, and catastrophizing and other-blame to the lowest extent. Furthermore, respondents who reported using self-blame, acceptance, rumination, and/or catastrophizing to a higher extent, also reported significantly higher levels of anxiety. Discussion: As the present study suggests that several cognitive coping strategies are related to anxiety, intervention programs should pay attention to these aspects. The present study gives important clues about which cognitive coping strategies should be challenged in treatment of flight anxiety.</abstract>"
2003,United States,"Physiology, medicine, long-duration space flight and the NSBRI","<title>Physiology, medicine, long-duration space flight and the NSBRI</title> <abstract>The hazards of long-duration space flight are real and unacceptable. In order for humans to participate effectively in long-duration orbital missions or continue the exploration of space, we must first secure the health of the astronaut and the success of such missions by assessing in detail the biomedical risks of space flight and developing countermeasures to these hazards. Acquiring the understanding necessary for building a sound foundation for countermeasure development requires an integrated approach to research in physiology and medicine and a level of cooperative action uncommon in the biomedical sciences. The research program of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) was designed to accomplish just such an integrated research goal, ameliorating or eliminating the biomedical risks of long-duration space flight and enabling safe and productive exploration of space. The fruits of these labors are not limited to the space program. We can also use the gained understanding of the effects and mechanisms of the physiological changes engendered in space and the applied preventive and rehabilitative methods developed to combat these changes to the benefit of those on Earth who are facing similar physiological and psychological difficulties. This paper will discuss the innovative approach the NSBRI has taken to integrated research management and will present some of the successes of this approach. © 2003 International Astronautical Federation.

No significant differences were found between the scores on the personality factors for the Pilot Incumbents and the Pilot Applicants. Further, the incumbents and applicants who had previous military training versus those who did not had highly similar personalities. However, on nearly every personality factor a significant difference was found between the general population norms and the sample of Pilot Incumbents and Applicants. The Pilot Incumbent/Applicant group scored significantly more intelligent, emotionally stable, and mature in comparison to the general population norms. We believe that it is the high-risk nature of this occupation that leads applicants, wishing to pursue this field, to assess very carefully their own person-job fit and self-select themselves, thus ultimately producing this very distinct ""pilot personality profile"" described in 1995 by Bartram.</abstract>"

2003,Spain,The assessment of spatial ability with a single computerized test,"<title>The assessment of spatial ability with a single computerized test</title> <abstract>Spatial cognitive ability has to do with how individuals deal with spatial information. Spatial ability is routinely assessed to predict performance in a variety of job positions, air traffic control being an example. Spatial tests are good predictors of performance in those occupations. One of the most valuable pieces of knowledge for psychological assessment in personnel selection is that concerning efficient ways to measure a given psychological trait, meaning that the measure shows high validity and low application costs. This article reports two studies showing the high efficiency of a new measure of spatial ability: SODT-R, a computer-administered test of dynamic spatial performance in which the person is required to simultaneously orient two moving points to a given destination that change from trial to trial. In the first study, 602 applicants for an air traffic control training course completed a battery of nine cognitive tests. In the second study, 105 university undergraduates completed a battery of 11 tests. Both batteries comprise tests of reasoning, visualization, spatial relations, and dynamic spatial performance. SODT-R emerges as a good measure of general spatial ability (Gv). This is especially true in the second study, where a broader sample of spatial tests is considered. A theoretical account based on the well-known high correlation between working memory capacity and cognitive abilities is discussed.</abstract>"

Utilizing the same methodology, continuity and change were traced in the 112 articles published during 1996 to 2000 (inclusive) on the dimensions examined in the inaugural review. It was noted that IJAP articles remain characterized by experimental methods in realistic settings using operational personnel as participants, and the analysis of variance as the primary method of analysis. There was, however, a move toward a greater proportion of articles submitted by multiple authors and a decrease in the number of practitioner articles published. While authors from the United States remained predominant as contributors, one of the most exciting changes identified was the move toward more international participation ensuring that IJAP is truly an internationally focused publication.</abstract>"
2002,France,Respective demands of task and function allocation on human-machine co-operation design: A psychological approach,"<title>Respective demands of task and function allocation on human-machine co-operation design: A psychological approach</title> <abstract>Co-operation between human operators and autonomous machines in dynamic (not fully controlled) situations implies a need for dynamic allocation of activities between the agents, in order to adapt the human-machine system to unexpected circumstances. Dynamic allocation is a way, for example, to avoid human workload peaks. Depending on whether tasks or functions are allocated, the demands made on human-machine co-operation design are different. Task and subtask allocation assume that both the human operator and the machine (or its designer) share the same decomposition of the overall task into subtasks. Function delegation is less demanding, provided that the human operator delegates functions to the machine explicitly, and within the context of a task representation transmitted by the human. This paper discusses these principles on the basis of experimental results taken from a series of studies on human-machine cooperation in air traffic control.</abstract>"

Methods: A standardized questionnaire (MM 040 NA) was mailed in February-March 1997 to all Stockholm aircrew on duty in a Scandinavian flight company (n = 1,857), and office workers from the same company (n = 218). During this time, smoking was allowed only on intercontinental flights. The participation rate was 81% (n = 1,513) of the aircrew, and 77% (n = 168) of the office group. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple logistic regression analysis, keeping age, gender, atopy, current smoking, occupation, and perceived psychosocial work conditions simultaneously in the model. Results: The most common symptoms among the aircrew were fatigue (21%), nasal symptoms (15%), ocular symptoms (11%), dry or flushed facial skin (12%), and dermal hand symptoms (12%). The aircrew had more nasal (odds ratio (OR) = 3.12), throat (OR = 5.75), and dermal symptoms on the face (OR = 2.03), and hands (OR = 3.68), than the office workers. The aircrew with a history of atopy had an increase of most symptoms (OR = 1.5-3.8), but age, gender, or smoking was not associated with symptoms. Perceived stress due to excess of work was associated with fatigue (OR = 7.33), feeling heavy-headed (OR = 9.52), headache (OR = 5.10), and facial dermal symptoms (OR = 3.75), while those crew with better work control and work satisfaction had less fatigue. For most symptoms, there were no differences between different categories onboard, but pilots had fewer ocular (OR = 0.28) nasal (OR = 0.52), and dermal hand symptoms (OR = 0.39). Airline crew that had been on an intercontinental flight the previous week had more complaints of fatigue (OR = 1.87), heavy-headedness (OR = 1.89), and difficulties concentrating (OR = 3.22). Conclusion: There was an association between symptoms and work stress, lack of influence on working conditions, atopy, and work on intercontinental flights where smoking was allowed. In view of the increase of civil aviation, the working conditions for aircrews need further attention. © Springer-Verlag 2002.</abstract>"

Thirty participants (Age = 39.8 ± 9.7) with confirmed DSM-IV diagnosis of specific phobia fear of flying were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VRGET with no physiological feedback (VRGETno), VRGET with physiological feedback (VRGETpm), or systematic desensitization with imaginal exposure therapy (IET). Eight sessions were conducted once a week. During each session, physiology was measured to give an objective measurement of improvement over the course of exposure therapy. In addition, self-report questionnaires, subjective ratings of anxiety (SUDs), and behavioral observations (included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a three-month posttreatment followup) were included. In the analysis of results, the Chi-square test of behavioral observations based on a three-month posttreatment followup revealed a statistically significant difference in flying behavior between the groups [x2(4) = 19.41, p < 0.001]. Only one participant (10%) who received IET, eight of the ten participants (80%) who received VRGETno, and ten out of the ten participants (100%) who received VRGET pm reported an ability to fly without medication or alcohol at three-month followup. Although this study included small sample sizes for the three groups, the results showed VRGET was more effective than IET in the treatment of flying. It also suggests that physiological feedback may add to the efficacy of VR treatment.</abstract>"
2002,Spain,Virtual reality treatment of flying phobia,"<title>Virtual reality treatment of flying phobia</title> <abstract>Flying phobia (FP) might become a very incapacitating and distributing problem in a person's social, working, and private areas. Psychological interventions based on exposure therapy have proved to be effective, but given the particular nature of this disorder they bear important limitations. Exposure therapy for FP might be excessively costly in terms of time, money, and efforts. Virtual reality (VR) overcomes these difficulties as different significant environments might be created, where the patient can interact with what he or she fears while in a totally safe and protected environment - the therapist's consulting room. This paper intends, on one hand, to show the different scenarios designed by our team for the VR treatment of FP, and on the other, to present the first results supporting the effectiveness of this new tool for the treatment of FP in a multiple baseline study.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Situation awareness and workload in aviation,"<title>Situation awareness and workload in aviation</title> <abstract>A pilot faces special challenges imposed by the need to control a multivariate lagged system in a heterogeneous multitask environment. The time lags between critical variabtes require prediction in an uncertain World. The interrelated concepts of situation awareness and workload are central to aviation psychology. Three components of situation awareness are spatial awareness, system awareness, and task awareness. Each of these components has real-world implications, spatial awareness for instrument displays, system awareness for keeping the operator informed about actions that have been taken by automated systems, and task awareness for attention and task management. Task management is directly related to mental workload, as the competing demands of tasks for attention exceed the operator's limited resources.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Controlled breaks as a fatigue countermeasure on the flight deck,"<title>Controlled breaks as a fatigue countermeasure on the flight deck</title> <abstract>Background: A major challenge for flight crews is the need to maintain vigilance during long, highly automated nighttime flights. No system currently exists to assist in managing alertness, and countermeasure options are limited. Surveys reveal many pilots use breaks as an in-flight countermeasure, but there have been no controlled studies of their effectiveness. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that brief, regular breaks could improve alertness and performance during an overnight flight. Methods. A 6-h, uneventful, nighttime flight in a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator was flown by fourteen two-man crews. The 14 subjects in the treatment group received 5 short breaks spaced hourly during cruise; the 14 subjects in the control group received 1 break in the middle of cruise. Continuous EEG/EOG, subjective sleepiness, and psychomotor vigilance performance data were collected. Results: During the latter part of the night, the treatment group showed significant reductions for 15 min post-break in slow eye movements, theta-band activity, and unintended sleep episodes compared with the control group. The treatment group reported significantly greater subjective alertness for up to 25 min post-break, with strongest effects near the time of the circadian trough. There was no evidence of objective vigilance performance improvement at 15-25 min post-break, with expected performance deterioration occurring due to elevated sleep drive and circadian time. Conclusions: The physiological and subjective data indicate the breaks reduced nighttime sleepiness for at least 15 min post-break and may have masked sleepiness for up to 25 min, suggesting the potential usefulness of short-duration breaks as an in-flight fatigue countermeasure.</abstract>"
2002,Spain,Circadian rhythms in airline pilots submitted to long-haul transmeridian flights,"<title>Circadian rhythms in airline pilots submitted to long-haul transmeridian flights</title> <abstract>Background: Circadian rhythms shift out of phase after transmeridian flights. Desynchronization between body rhythms and the environment is linked to jet lag, which depends on age, flight direction, and number of time zones crossed. Methods: To investigate this problem in airline pilots, we performed a multivariate analysis of their circadian systems during Madrid-Mexico-Madrid flights (-7 time zones, n = 12) and Madrid-Tokyo-Madrid flights (+8 time zones, n = 21). Telemetry was used to record pilots' activity, skin temperature, and heart rate, obtaining 6 d of continuous data, including 2 d before the flight, the flights themselves, 2 d atthe stopover, and 1 d after the return flight. Time series were analyzed by cosinor, and the resulting parameters of the rhythms were compared by ANOVA and Tukey contrasts in every category formed by the age groups (under and over 50 yr old) and flight direction groups. Subjective time estimation of short, intermediate, and long intervals was recorded. Other psychological variables were measured, including anxiety, tiredness, and performance. Results and Conclusions: Activity/rest and heart rate rhythms appeared to be linked to a ""weak oscillator."" Temperature rhythms manifested a rigid response after the phase shifts of the light/dark cycle, closely related to the biological clock. Subjective time appreciation tended to be overestimated without exhibiting a clear circadian component, but attributable to fatigue and stress. Psychometric evaluation showed that desynchronization affected all the pilots. Some results showed an age-related variability with a more marked influence in younger pilots. No consistent effects regarding flight direction were found.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Self-rated changes in cognition and piloting skills: A comparison of younger and older airline pilots,"<title>Self-rated changes in cognition and piloting skills: A comparison of younger and older airline pilots</title> <abstract>Background. The relationship of chronological age to self-rated changes in cognition has been studied extensively. However, the relationship of these changes to age-related changes in piloting skills is not well understood. Objective: This study aims to determine whether airline pilots report age-related changes in cognitive abilities, and whether these changes are related to self-rated changes in piloting skills. Methods: A total of 1310 airline pilots (28-59 yr, mean age = 45.5 yr; mean total flight time = 11,992 h) currently employed by a major U.S. commercial air carrier participated in the study. A 13-item Aviation Experience Survey (AES) was completed by each pilot, using 5-point Likert ratings and yes/no responses comparing current cognitive abilities (e.g., concentration, reaction speed) and piloting skills (e.g., piloting in adverse weather, decision making while flying) with those of 10 yr ago. Results: Cognitive abilities and piloting skills were more likely to be rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" than 10 yr ago by pilots age 39 or under than by pilots in their 40s and 50s, who were more likely to rate their abilities and skills as ""the same."" Fewer than 20% of pilots in any age group rated their cognitive abilities or piloting skills as ""worse"" or ""much worse"" than 10 yr ago. Pilots who reported more anxiety or stress while flying reported more negative changes in abilities, skills, and health status regardless of age. Conclusions: Self-ratings of cognition and piloting skills vary by age, but older pilots are not more likely to report negative changes in their abilities and skills than younger pilots. Further research is needed to verify whether these self-appraisals reflect true changes in skills over time.</abstract>"

2002,United States,Using model checking to help discover mode confusions and other automation surprises,"<title>Using model checking to help discover mode confusions and other automation surprises</title> <abstract>Automation surprises occur when an automated system behaves differently than its operator expects. If the actual system behavior and the operator's 'mental model' are both described as finite state transition systems, then mechanized techniques known as 'model checking' can be used automatically to discover any scenarios that cause the behaviors of the two descriptions to diverge from one another. These scenarios identify potential surprises and pinpoint areas where design changes, or revisions to training materials or procedures, should be considered. The mental models can be suggested by human factors experts, or can be derived from training materials, or can express simple requirements for 'consistent' behavior. The approach is demonstrated by applying the Murø state exploration system to a 'kill-the-capture' surprise in the MD-88 autopilot. This approach does not supplant the contributions of those working in human factors and aviation psychology, but rather provides them with a tool to examine properties of their models using mechanized calculation. These calculations can be used to explore the consequences of alternative designs and cues, and of systematic operator error, and to assess the cognitive complexity of designs. The description of model checking is tutorial and is hoped to be accessible to those from the human factors community to whom this technology may be new. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.</abstract>"

2002,Pakistan - Sweden - United States,Psychological and Psychophysiological Models of Pilot Performance for Systems Development and Mission Evaluation,"<title>Psychological and Psychophysiological Models of Pilot Performance for Systems Development and Mission Evaluation</title> <abstract>The purpose of our study was to analyze the effects of mission complexity on pilot mental workload, situational awareness, and pilot performance and to develop models by means of structural equation modeling. Earlier studies indicate that mission complexity affects mental workload and that mental workload affects situational awareness, which, in turn, affects pilot performance. In the first phase of this study, 20 fighter pilots performed 150 missions. In the second phase, 15 pilots performed 40 simulated missions. The pilots answered questionnaires on mission complexity, mental workload, mental capacity, situational awareness, and performance. During the simulated missions we measured eye fixation rate, heart rate, and blink rate. Model analyses show that mission complexity affects workload and that workload affects situational awareness and performance. Significant relationships occur between heart rate and rated workload, mental capacity, situational awareness, and performance. Model analyses show a workload factor combining psychological and physiological aspects and a performance factor combining situational awareness and pilot performance. Significant relationships occur among heart rate, eye fixation rate, and blink rate.</abstract>"
2002,United States,A Framework for Understanding Crew Performance Assessment Issues,"<title>A Framework for Understanding Crew Performance Assessment Issues</title> <abstract>The focus of this special issue is on training pilot instructors to assess crew performance. In this opening article we attempt to set the stage for the other articles in this issue by introducing a framework for understanding crew-performance assessment. We use this framework to outline issues that should be addressed when training pilot instructors, and we point to specific articles in the special issue that begin to answer these questions. We also look to literature from domains outside aviation psychology for guidance. Research on performance appraisal in the field of industrial psychology provides techniques and knowledge relevant to training instructors to evaluate crews reliably and validly. We conclude with a series of research questions that should be addressed.</abstract>"
2002,United States,"A 1-year, three-couple expedition as a crew analog for a mars mission","<title>A 1-year, three-couple expedition as a crew analog for a mars mission</title> <abstract>This study assessed the intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning of a three-couple expedition group that included a 21/2-year-old child which was ice-locked on a boat in the High Arctic during a major portion of the expedition. Personality assessment indicated that team members were generally well adjusted, scoring relatively higher on well-being and achievement and relatively lower on stress reactivity. Weekly mood ratings showed that the group exhibited significantly higher positive than negative affect. Reported negative events were relatively most frequent at the beginning of the Arctic stay and toward the end of the darkness period and were lowest during the initial darkness interval. The period of darkness had both a salutary and negative impact. A highly important means of coping with stress was seeking emotional support from one’s partner. Selection of couples with strong bonds with their partner appears to be one viable approach for crew selection for long-duration missions.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Human factors in multi-crew flight operations,"<title>Human factors in multi-crew flight operations</title> <abstract>This paper discusses selected aviation human factors challenges in the air transport environment. Because of the authors' background, much of this paper will be based upon the growth of human factors and airline training in transport aviation in the United States. However, parallel growth and advancements have been made in other parts of the world from the beginning of air transport and are being made in many parts of the world today. This is certainly true of Great Britain. One should never forget that air transport is a world enterprise and has been since its beginning. While it is important to recognise that cultural and other differences should be considered if they are relevant, it is equally important in air transport to recognise that common problems are solved by common solutions and can be addressed by, but are not limited to, common approaches. It is recognised that the behavioral aspect of aviation human factors deserves considerable attention, particularly in the area of training and evaluation. We have also learned that previous training criteria are not satisfactory for operation with increasingly complex aircraft being operated in an increasingly complex environment. Human errors occur with greater frequency than is often believed and can be made by anyone - even an airline captain. An inevitable consequence of this entirely human characteristic is that the role of the co-pilot has been considerably enhanced. Furthermore, the monitoring function of the pilot-not-flying, whether he/she is the captain or co-pilot, is now recognised as a critical safety function by virtually all serious operational experts.</abstract>"

We employed a longitudinal study based on two meal replacements daily with subjects choosing a third 'sensible' meal. The subjects were 492 healthy, overweight men and women working in high-stress occupations (police, hospital health professionals, flight crew members, firefighters). The mean group ages ranged from 32.17 ± 5.70 to 44.50 ± 16.40 years; the mean group body mass indexes (BMIs) ranged from 27.40 ± 2.54 to 32.90 ± 3.39 kg/m2. The completion rate for the 12 weeks was 79.8%. Reductions in mean weight and mean BMI were greater than in medically supervised clinical trials with non-worksite adults. Firefighters lost the most weight and medical personnel the least. Follow-up found considerable retention of weight loss. Men lost significantly more weight than women (P < 0.006). We conclude that employees in some high-stress settings may participate productively in worksite weight reduction and maintenance programs that use meal replacements.</abstract>"
2002,,Air rage: Implications for forensic psychiatry,"<title>Air rage: Implications for forensic psychiatry</title> <abstract>Abusive airline passengers are a growing hazard that has not received the same attention as other forms of ""rage"" behavior. In this article, a number of interesting and significant cases of air rage are described, including one that almost resulted in the loss of a British Airways 747-400 jumbo jet with all aboard, when a paranoid schizophrenic passenger gained entry to the cockpit. Other examples involve an intoxicated Russian, who became so violent that a physician on board had to inject him with Valium, a violent passenger who died as a result of actions taken by frightened passengers, a man who became berserk and psychotic because of encephalitis, and a woman who became agitated and confused from the ""bends."" Air rage is defined and current data are presented regarding the frequency of this phenomenon and how numbers have increased dramatically over the last several years. Special emphasis is given to 168 cases of passenger rage obtained from the FAA that were analyzed by the author. The contributory factors are discussed in detail, with the primary factors identified being alcohol intoxication, nicotine withdrawal states, disputes and arguments with flight attendants, and a variety of mental disturbances. Described as ""the rage of the millennium, "" the contributory factors associated with air rage are used to suggest strategies for prevention and management. Two flight attendants are described who were involved in a particularly frightening air rage incident, and who, as a result, were referred for the treatment of acute posttraumatic stress disorder.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Assessing pilots with 'the wrong stuff': A call for research on emotional health factors in commercial aviators,"<title>Assessing pilots with 'the wrong stuff': A call for research on emotional health factors in commercial aviators</title> <abstract>The responsibility that airline pilots have toward the safety of passengers is immense. Airline pilots are likely to be among the most reliable and psychologically problem-free populations. Yet, psychological problems can and do occur among persons who pursue this occupation although the actual extent is unknown. Personality disorders, substance abuse disorders, bipolar disorder, and psychosis are mental health problems that can prevent a person from holding medical certification required in airline flying. No definitive epidemiological studies have been conducted to provide rates of these and other disorders in this important population. Personality and emotional factors have been found to impact job performance; however, most airlines do little in the way of psychological assessment at the initial hiring stage or throughout the pilot's career to detect potential personality problems or emotional disorders. Much is known about the personality and mental health factors that could affect performance of pilots but little of this information has been incorporated in pilot screening programs. This article surveys a number of potential problem areas that can lead to performance decrements. Recommendations with respect to psychological assessment in airline pilot mental health determinations are suggested. Further research to determine the full extent of maladjustment among pilots is recommended.</abstract>"

Methods: In our recently completed NASA-funded study of 5 U.S. astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 U.S. and 16 Russian mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir program, we evaluated a number of important psychosocial issues such as group tension, cohesion, leadership role, and the displacement of negative emotions from crewmembers to people in mission control and from mission control personnel to management. Results: Based on our findings, which are reviewed, a number of psychosocial countermeasures are suggested to help ameliorate the negative impact of potential psychosocial problems during future manned space missions. Conclusions: Crewmembers should be selected not only to rule out psychopathology but also to select-in for group compatibility and facility in a common language. Training should include briefings and team building related to a number of psychosocial issues and should involve both crewmembers and mission control personnel. During the mission, both experts on the ground and the crewmembers themselves should be alert to potential interpersonal problems, including the displacement of negative emotions from the crew to the ground. Supportive activities should consist of both individual and interpersonal strategies, including an awareness of changing leisure time needs. Finally, attention should be given to post-mission readjustment and to supporting the families on Earth.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Assessment of personality and crew interaction skills in successful naval aviators,"<title>Assessment of personality and crew interaction skills in successful naval aviators</title> <abstract>Purpose: We were interested in studying a full range of successful aviators to discern which personality factors were present and whether these factors correlate with age, rank, and accumulated flight time. Method: The Armstrong Laboratory Aviator Personality Survey (ALAPS) was administered to 312 designated naval aviators and flight officers from a variety of aircraft communities. The sample included O-3/O-4 elite aviators who were selected for their squadron billets based on superior performance, O-5/O-6 aviators selected for command positions, and 59 flag officers. Results: The junior aviators scored higher on the factor associated with Dogmatism and lower on the factor associated with Team Orientation and Socialness. This pattern was reversed for the flag officers, while O-5/O-6 aviators received intermediate scores on each of these factors. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates a correlation between specific ALAPS factors and experience, rank, age, and flight time. The combination of high Dogmatism, low Team Orientation, and low Socialness in junior aviators could suggest lower openness to crew input and increased risk for mishaps.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Human factors analysis of accidents involving visual flight rules flight into adverse weather,"<title>Human factors analysis of accidents involving visual flight rules flight into adverse weather</title> <abstract>Background: General aviation (GA) accident statistics indicate that visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is a major safety hazard. However, little research has been conducted to identify the factors that influence VFR pilots' decisions to risk flying into deteriorating weather. The purpose of the present study was to further examine the causes of GA accidents associated with VFR flight into IMC. Method: A comprehensive review of GA accident reports maintained by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was conducted to identify accidents involving VFR flight into IMC between January 1990 and December 1997. These accidents were compared with other GA accidents that occurred during the same time period. Results: Analyses of these accidents revealed that VFR flight into IMC accidents were more likely to involve less-experienced pilots and to have passengers aboard the accident aircraft compared with the other GA accidents. In addition, most VFR flight into IMC accidents were considered by the NTSB to have involved intentional flight into adverse weather by the pilot. Discussion: These findings are interpreted in terms of their implications for the underlying causes of VFR flight into IMC, including situation assessment, risk perception, and social pressure. Intervention programs that address all of these factors are needed.</abstract>"
2002,United Kingdom,Task and postural factors are related to back pain in helicopter pilots,"<title>Task and postural factors are related to back pain in helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>Background: A previous survey by Shear et al. revealed a high prevalence of back pain in Royal Navy helicopter aircrew, compared with controls. It was recommended that a second survey be undertaken, taking account of flying tasks and cockpit ergonomics. This was the purpose of the present investigation. Method: A questionnaire containing items on back pain and posture was circulated to all 246 acting pilots, with returns of 75%. The questionnaire sought information on pain in both the flying pilot and co-pilot/instructor roles. Results: The 12-mo prevalence of back pain was 80%. Task-related back pain was greatest in instrument flying (72%) and least in the co-pilot and instructor roles (24%). Self-ratings of posture indicated that forward flexed trunk postures predominated in the flying roles and were most extreme in instrument flying. In non-flying roles, symmetrical, reclining postures were more often reported. No demographic or psychosocial variables were significantly related to back pain prevalence or disability. Conclusions: Much of the back pain experienced by helicopter pilots appears to be due to the posture needed to operate the cyclic and collective controls. In instrument flying, it is suggested that the visual demands of scanning the displays may exacerbate the pain by causing the pilot to lean further forward.</abstract>"
2001,Spain,Two Short Tests Fail to Detect Vigilance Decrements,"<title>Two Short Tests Fail to Detect Vigilance Decrements</title> <abstract>Deterioration in performance associated with decreased ability to sustain attention may be found in long and tedious task sessions. The necessity for assessing a number of psychological dimensions in a single session often demands ""short"" tests capable of assessing individual differences in abilities such as vigilance and maintenance of high performance levels. In the present paper two tasks were selected as candidates for playing this role, the Abbreviated Vigilance Task (AVT) by Temple, Warm, Dember, LaGrange and Matthews (1996) and the Continuous Attention Test (CAT) by Tiplady (1992). However, when applied to a sample of 829 candidates in a job-selection process for air-traffic controllers, neither of them showed discriminative capacity. In a second study, an extended version of the CAT was applied to a similar sample of 667 subjects, but also proved incapable of properly detecting individual differences. In short, at least in a selection context such as that studied here, neither of the tasks appeared appropriate for playing the role of a ""short"" test for discriminating individual differences in performance deterioration in sustained attention.</abstract>"
2001,United States,In-flight psychiatric emergencies,"<title>In-flight psychiatric emergencies</title> <abstract>Background: Although studies have been published regarding airline in-flight medical emergencies, there is a lack of any specific studies about in-flight psychiatric emergencies. This study seeks to ascertain the incidence of in-flight psychiatric emergencies, their associated factors, and outcomes. Methods: All in-flight calls for physician consultation to MedAire, a leading medical resource for airlines, during 1997 were reviewed for psychiatric symptomatology. Results: Of 1375 consultations, 3.5% were characterized as psychiatric, with a large majority (90%) of these cases presenting primarily as acute anxiety. Most of the psychiatric cases (69%) required arrangements for the passenger to be evaluated on arrival, and three cases required emergency flight diversion and landing. Conclusions: This study suggests that an anxiolytic agent with a rapid onset may be indicated for the on-board medical kit.</abstract>"
2001,Japan,The number of steps taken by flight attendants during international long-haul flights,"<title>The number of steps taken by flight attendants during international long-haul flights</title> <abstract>Previous studies have revealed that female cabin attendants on long flights are most likely to have health problems. Since health problems can be related to workload and work stress and since the number of steps taken by an employee during a work shift can be an objective measure of the work load of cabin attendants, it is necessary to evaluate the predictors of the number of steps. Methods: We used pedometers worn by 118 female flight attendants to study the number of steps during flights and its predictors during long international flights. Results:The mean number of steps during 636.53 (SD = 129.11)-minute flights was 10,742.85 (SD = 3,547.17). The crude number of steps per minute was 16.88, and the adjusted number of steps per minute was 14.04. Flight length and the number of sleeping hours worked (i.e., between midnight and 6:00 am) were significant predictors of the number of steps. Conclusion: Although it is implied that flight duration and night flight increase the work load of flight attendants, we need to consider psychological aspects to evaluate the overall effects of their jobs on work stress and health.</abstract>"
2001,Norway,Crew tension during a space station simulation,"<title>Crew tension during a space station simulation</title> <abstract>Two space simulation studies for the European Space Agency found that interpersonal tension increased in the beginning, around the middle, and toward the end of the confinement. This article reports data from a third study where this issue was further examined. Three subjects were confined in the MIR space station simulator in Moscow for 135 days. Communication analysis, peer rating, questionnaires, and interviews were used to assess crew tension. The temporal pattern found in this study corresponds to the previous findings. The beginning of the period was characterized by competition over leadership. Decreased crew cohesion and aggression toward the mission control marked the middle of the confinement. In the final weeks, open conflicts emerged, and one member was socially excluded. Joking occurred frequently in the first half of the confinement, whereas negative emotional expressions increased in the second half. These results might assist planners in anticipating behavioral problems during space missions.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Autogenic feedback training exercise and pilot performance: Enhanced functioning under search-and-rescue flying conditions,"<title>Autogenic feedback training exercise and pilot performance: Enhanced functioning under search-and-rescue flying conditions</title> <abstract>Studies have shown that autonomous mode behavior is one cause of aircraft fatalities due to pilot error. In such cases, the pilot is in a high state of psychological and physiological arousal and tends to focus on one problem, while ignoring more critical information. This study examined the effect of training in physiological self-recognition and regulation, as a means of improving crew cockpit performance. Seventeen pilots were assigned to the treatment and control groups matched for accumulated flight hours. The treatment group contained 4 pilots from HC-130 Hercules aircraft and 4 HH-65 Dolphin helicopter pilots; the control group contained 3 pilots of HC-130s and 6 helicopter pilots. During an initial flight, physiological data were recorded on each crewmember and an instructor pilot rated individual crew performance. Eight crewmembers were then taught to regulate their own physiological response levels using Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE). The remaining participants received no training. During a second flight, treatment participants showed significant improvement in performance (rated by the same instructor pilot as in pretests) while controls did not improve. The results indicate that AFTE management of high states of physiological arousal may improve pilot performance during emergency flying conditions.</abstract>"
2001,Russian Federation,Interrelations between the small isolated groups with homogeneous and heterogeneous composition.,"<title>Interrelations between the small isolated groups with homogeneous and heterogeneous composition.</title> <abstract>Increase in the heterogeneity of a space crew's composition (cultural and gender differences) is a risk factor that can negatively influence the formation of a cohesive crew, which depends on a common way of perceiving one's social environment, goals and values. Method. Three groups working in isolation from 110 to 240 days, all with different cultural and gender composition were analysed using a modification of Kelly's repertory grid technique during a space simulation at the Institute for Biomedical Problems, Moscow. Subjects assessed themselves and each other monthly. Results. National Russian and international groups failed to create a single cohesive crew. Members of both groups considered people from their group as ""us"" and their neighbours as ""them"". Their relations became more negative during the mission, with attitudes changing from neutral to poor. Subjects began to perceive each other as ""different and distant"". Cultural and language differences prevented national (Russian) and international groups from forming a common understanding of behavioural rules and establishing close emotional contacts. Conclusions. Differences in perception of the interpersonal environment, group goals and values in national and international groups hindered the formation of a joint cohesive crew.</abstract>"
2001,Australia,Runway width effects in the visual approach to landing,"<title>Runway width effects in the visual approach to landing</title> <abstract>The effect of changes in runway width on the perception of glide-slope has been the subject of extensive investigations. Despite considerable research, an explanation of this effect has been elusive. A mathematical model for glide-slope perception was published recently based on the premise that a desirable goal of perception is to form a perception with minimal uncertainty. One of the qualitative predictions of that model was that changes in the aspect ratio of the runway would affect the perceived glide-slope. In this article, the predictions of the model are quantified and are shown to be in close agreement with experimental results in the literature.</abstract>"

In order to timely detect and mitigate consequences of latent or active failures, effective team behaviour of the crezc members is an indispensable condition. While this fact is generally agreed in the aviation community, there seems to be a wide range of concepts hots crews should interact most effectively. Within the framework of the European project JARTEL. the cultural robustness of evaluations of crew behaviour was examined. 105 instructor pilots from 14 different airlines representing 12 European countries participated in this project. The instructors' evaluations of creze behaviours in eight video scenarios will be compared in relation to cultural differences on Hofstede's dimensions of Power Distance and Individualism.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Token majority: The work attitudes of male flight attendants,"<title>Token majority: The work attitudes of male flight attendants</title> <abstract>This study examined the work experiences of men, a traditional workplace majority, as minority members of a female-dominated occupation. We used tokenism and social categorization theories to propose and test a set of hypotheses that link token status (a less than 15% minority) with male flight attendants' work attitudes through intervening psychological and job factors. Survey data from a sample of 236 male and female flight attendants supported a model in which a negative relationship between token status and the work attitudes of job satisfaction and organizational attachment was mediated by low self-esteem, increased role ambiguity, and poor job fit. The uncovering of these previously unmeasured intervening variables strengthens theoretical connections between demography and work outcomes and suggests leverage points for improving the work attitudes of individuals in the minority.</abstract>"

2001,United States,Psychosocial issues in space: results from Shuttle/Mir.,"<title>Psychosocial issues in space: results from Shuttle/Mir.</title> <abstract>Important psychosocial issues involving tension, cohesion, leader support, and displacement of negative emotions were evaluated in a 4 1/2-year study involving five U.S. and four Russian Shuttle/Mir space missions. Weekly mood and group climate questionnaires were completed by five U.S. astronauts, eight Russian cosmonauts, and 42 U.S. and 16 Russian mission control subjects. There were few findings that supported our hypothesized changes in tension, cohesion, and leader support in crew and ground subjects using various time models, although crewmembers reported decreasing leader support in the 2nd half of the missions, and astronauts showed some evidence of a novelty effect in the first few weeks. There was no evidence suggesting a 3rd quarter effect among crewmembers on any of the 21 subscales evaluated. In contrast, there was strong evidence to support the hypothesized displacement of tension and negative emotions from crewmembers to mission control personnel and from mission control personnel to management. There were several significant differences in response between Americans vs. Russians, crewmembers vs. mission control personnel, and subjects in this study vs. people in comparable groups on Earth. Subject responses before, during, and after the missions were similar, and we did not find evidence for asthenia in space. Critical incidents that were reported generally dealt with events on-board the Mir and interpersonal conflicts, although most of the responses were from a relatively small number of subjects. Our findings have implications for future training and lead to a number of countermeasures.</abstract>"
2001,Norway,Psychosocial issues in space: future challenges.,"<title>Psychosocial issues in space: future challenges.</title> <abstract>As the duration of space flights increases and crews become more heterogeneous, psychosocial factors are likely to play an increasingly important role in determining mission success. The operations of the International Space Station and planning of interplanetary missions represent important future challenges for how to select, train and monitor crews. So far, empirical evidence about psychological factors in space is based on simulations and personnel in analog environments (i.e. polar expeditions, submarines). It is apparent that attempts to transfer from these environments to space requires a thorough analysis of the human behavior specific to the fields. Recommendations for research include the effects of multi-nationality on crew interaction, development of tension within crews and between Mission Control, and prediction of critical phases in adaptation over time. Selection of interpersonally compatible crews, pre-mission team training and implementation of tools for self-monitoring of psychological parameters ensure that changes in mission requirements maximize crew performance.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Does Learning a Complex Task Have to Be Complex?: A Study in Learning Decomposition,"<title>Does Learning a Complex Task Have to Be Complex?: A Study in Learning Decomposition</title> <abstract>Many theories of skill acquisition have had considerable success in addressing the fine details of learning in relatively simple tasks, but can they scale up to complex tasks that are more typical of human learning in the real world? Some theories argue for scalability by making the implicit assumption that complex tasks consist of many smaller parts, which are learned according to basic learning principles. Surprisingly, there has been rather sparse empirical testing of this crucial assumption. In this article, we examine this assumption directly by decomposing the learning in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air-Traffic Controller Task (Ackerman, 1988) from the learning at the global level all the way down to the learning at the keystroke level. First, we reanalyze the data from Ackerman (1988) and show that the learning in this complex task does indeed reflect the learning of smaller parts at the keystroke level. Second, in a follow-up eye-tracking experiment, we show that a large portion of the learning at the keystroke level reflects the learning even at a lower, i.e., attentional level. © 2001 Academic Press.</abstract>"

Three studies involving the complex and dynamic Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Control Task (P. L. Ackerman & R.

This article samples a broadly distributed research base regarding influences of the physical environment on human cognition. The presentation draws primarily on studies conducted within the context of dynamic physical domains of work, to address controls and information sources for enabling human intervention, and related reasoning and planning. Several examples illustrate the role of the environment as a source of information and as an influence on the sequencing of work activity. Life support is discussed both as an instance of a dynamic physical system and for its potential to preclude direct engagement with the environment, with predictable cognitive consequences.</abstract>"
2001,United States,The impact of fatigue in air medical and other types of operations: a review of fatigue facts and potential countermeasures.,"<title>The impact of fatigue in air medical and other types of operations: a review of fatigue facts and potential countermeasures.</title> <abstract>Because of its effects on productivity and safety, fatigue is receiving increasing attention in a variety of settings, including aviation. Fatigue-related problems cost America an estimated $18 billion a year in terms of lost productivity, and fatigue-related drowsiness on the highways contributes to more than 1500 fatalities, 100,000 crashes, and 76,000 injuries annually. Furthermore, evidence is mounting that pilot and aircrew fatigue has been a causative factor in several aviation mishaps. Although substantial research has been conducted on the nature of fatigue and the effectiveness of various countermeasures, much of the relevant information may not be reaching those who need it most. The importance of obtaining adequate daily sleep and the efficacy of proper work/rest schedules, strategic napping, rest breaks, circadian-entrainment interventions, and other techniques should be emphasized in air medical training programs along with the more standard courses aimed at maintaining crew skills and improving flight safety. Once the facts are known, the aircrew's ability to control fatigue will enhance the productivity and safety of air ambulance operations.</abstract>"

2000,Australia,Effect of normobaric hypoxia on auditory sensitivity,"<title>Effect of normobaric hypoxia on auditory sensitivity</title> <abstract>Previous psychophysical studies of hypoxia's effects on auditory sensitivity have provided mixed results but the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that sensitivity is unaffected by hypoxia. This conclusion is discrepant with that drawn from physiological studies in which hypoxia has been found to affect auditory-evoked response (AER) latency. One possible explanation of this discrepancy concerns the relatively low maximum frequency (8 kHz) for which hypoxia's effects were assessed in the psychophysical studies. We have extended the range of frequencies over which hypoxia's effects have been examined to include frequencies up to 16 kHz. Thresholds for 1-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 14- and 16-kHz tones were measured at levels of hypoxia equivalent to altitudes of 0, 1200, 2400 and 3700 m. Our results indicate that sensitivity for frequencies up to 16 kHz is unaffected by hypoxia. We suggest that AER latency does not provide a valid measure of auditory sensitivity.</abstract>"

2000,Brazil,Blood pressure and sympathetic activity in normotensive aviators during short-haul fixed-wings flights,"<title>Blood pressure and sympathetic activity in normotensive aviators during short-haul fixed-wings flights</title> <abstract>Background: In order to evaluate the impact of in-flight stress on BP and sympathetic activity during a short fixed-wing flight, we have studied 18 healthy and normotensive commercial captain aviators, aged 37.5 ± 4.9 yr. Methods: The protocol consisted of a 120-min flight period, divided into segments of pre-flight, take off, mid-cruise, approach and landing, and a 120-min control period. In both flight and control periods, all subjects underwent BP monitoring, heart rate recording and urine collection for cathecolamines. Results: Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) were higher during the flight, as a whole, when compared with the control period (134 ± 11 vs. 121 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.05 and 84 ± 8 vs. 76 ± 9 mmHg, p < 0.05, respectively). During the flight period, SBP increased in the pre-flight, take-off, approach and landing segments, whereas DBP increased in the take- off, mid-cruise, approach and landing segments. Heart rate did not change in any flight segment. Urinary cathecolamines increased during the flight period in comparison to control period 0.20 (0.10-1.8) mg · mg-1 creatinine vs. 0.10 (0.10-1.0) mg · mg-1 creatinine; p < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that inflight stress increases BP of the normotensive aviators by sympathetic activation during short-haul flights.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Review of extensive workups of 34 patients overexposed to radiofrequency radiation,"<title>Review of extensive workups of 34 patients overexposed to radiofrequency radiation</title> <abstract>Background: The medical records of 34 patients seen at the Aerospace Medicine Directorate, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for confirmed exposure to radiofrequency radiation (RFR) exceeding the permitted exposure limits were reviewed to see if RFR overexposure created any detectable clinical or laboratory alterations that could be correlated with power density or the product of power density and time exposed. The goal of this study was to determine which physiological and laboratory parameters required closest attention on work up of future patients with RFR exposure. Methods: All 34 patients received an extensive history and physical examination, and a large battery of laboratory studies. Clinical findings were also compared with laboratory results. Results: A sensation of warmth was positively associated with power density. A negative correlation was observed between an abnormal tissue destruction screen and power density. Sophisticated neurological tests in 23 patients and extensive psychometric and psychological exams in 30 patients revealed no neurological or ophthalmologic findings attributable to RFR. A few patients reported burning pain that resolved over several weeks; neurological findings were minimal or absent. Conclusions: Patients with suspected RFR overexposures need to be seen promptly at the nearest medical facility. Based on this study, an extensive evaluation of persons overexposed to non-ionizing radiation should not be routinely performed. However, a careful history and physical examination with laboratory studies as indicated should be performed and the patient's concerns about RFR effects addressed fully.</abstract>"

We describe the case of a 31-yr-old student helicopter pilot who presented to the Aviation Psychiatry Department with a several-month history of inconsistent training performance, mood lability, tearfulness, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, and decreased concentration. Symptoms persisted despite stress management training and resolution of family stressors, and further evaluation revealed other symptoms consistent with early menopause. Symptoms responded to estrogen/progesterone therapy, and patient returned to flight training. The clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, treatment, and aeromedical disposition of perimenopause and menopause are discussed.</abstract>"
2000,United Kingdom,Chronic jet lag produces cognitive deficits.,"<title>Chronic jet lag produces cognitive deficits.</title> <abstract>Traveling across time zones causes disruption to the normal circadian rhythms and social schedules because of travelers' shift in time. As the endogenous circadian timing system adapts slowly to new time cues, the phase relationship between biological rhythms and external time cues are out of synchronization for a period of time. This disturbance of circadian rhythms has been shown to impair physical and psychological health (Winget et al., 1984). To test the effects of repeated jet lag on mental abilities, airline cabin crew were compared with ground crew. Salivary cortisol was used as a physiological marker for circadian disruption. The cabin crew group, who had a history of repeated jet lag, had significantly higher salivary cortisol levels in an average working day. In addition, this elevated level of cortisol was only seen in the same subjects when the cabin crew were on transmeridian flights but not domestic flights. Cabin crew also exhibited cognitive deficits, possibly in working memory, that became apparent after several years of chronic disruption of circadian rhythms.</abstract>"

The aim is to gain deeper understanding of anticipatory activity in dynamic situations. Analysis of the results reveals response biases of which the most common is that controllers predict aircraft positions as being closer than their actual positions. We demonstrate that estimations are affected by situation contextual and psychological factors. We also discuss the transferability of time reasoning models developed in the field of time psychology, in the light of the results obtained. We conclude by raising some issues relative to the design of control-aid tools.</abstract>"

2000,United States,Discriminability measures for predicting readability of text on textured backgrounds,"<title>Discriminability measures for predicting readability of text on textured backgrounds</title> <abstract>Several discriminability measures were examined for their ability to predict reading search times for three levels of text contrast and a range of backgrounds (plain, a periodic texture, and four spatial-frequency-filtered textures created from the periodic texture). Search times indicate that these background variations only affect readability when the text contrast is low, and that spatial frequency content of the background affects readability. These results were not well predicted by the single variables of text contrast (Spearman rank correlation = -0.64) and background RMS contrast (0.08), but a global masking index and a spatial-frequency-selective masking index led to better predictions (-0.84 and -0.81, respectively). © 2000 Optical Society of America.</abstract>"

Experiment 1 assessed the predictability of individual differences in asymptotic skill levels on the Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Controller (ATC) task. Experiment 2 provided an exploration of the construct space underlying perceptual-speed abilities. Experiment 3 concerned an evaluation of theoretical predictions for individual differences in performance over skill development in a complex air traffic control simulation task (TRACON) and the ATC task, with an extensive battery of general and perceptual-speed measures, along with a newly developed PC-based suite of psychomotor ability measures. Evidence addressing the predictability of individual differences in performance at early, intermediate, and asymptotic levels of practice is presented.</abstract>"

2000,Norfolk Island - United States,A closed-loop system for examining psychophysiological measures for adaptive task allocation,"<title>A closed-loop system for examining psychophysiological measures for adaptive task allocation</title> <abstract>A closed-loop system was evaluated for its efficacy in using psychophysiological indexes to moderate workload. Participants were asked to perform either 1 or 3 tasks from the Multiattribute Task Battery and complete the NASA Task Load Index after each trial. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was sampled continuously while they performed the tasks, and an EEG index (beta/alpha plus theta) was derived. The system made allocation decisions as a function of the level of operator engagement based on the value of the EEG index. The results of the study demonstrated that it was possible to moderate an operator's level of engagement through a closed-loop system driven by the operator's own EEG. In addition, the system had a significant impact on behavioral, subjective, and psychophysiological correlates of workload as task load increased. The theoretical and practical implications of these results for adaptive automation are discussed.</abstract>"

2000,,Introduction to cognitive processes of expert pilots.,"<title>Introduction to cognitive processes of expert pilots.</title> <abstract>This report addresses the historical problem that a very high percentage of accidents have been classified as involving ""pilot error."" Through extensive research since 1977, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that the predominant underlying cause of these types of accidents involved decisional problems or cognitive information processing. To attack these problems, Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) training materials were developed and tested for ten years. Since the publication of the ADM training manuals in 1987, significant reductions in human performance error (HPE) accidents have been documented both in the U.S. and world wide. However, shortcomings have been observed in the use of these materials for recurrency training and in their relevance to more experienced pilots. The following discussion defines the differences between expert and novice decision makers from a cognitive information processing perspective, correlates the development of expert pilot cognitive processes with training and experience, and reviews accident scenarios which exemplify those processes. This introductory material is a necessary prerequisite to an understanding of how to formulate expert pilot decision making training innovations; and, to continue the record of improved safety through ADM training.</abstract>"

Preliminary results from a NASA B727 simulator study indicate that specific language variables are moderately to highly correlated with individual performance, individual error rates, and individual communication ratings. Also, language use was found to vary as a function of crew position and level of workload during the flight. Use of the first person plural (we, our, us) increases over the life of a flightcrew, and Captains speak more in the first person plural than First Officers or Flight Engineers. Language use in initial flights was associated with performance and error in subsequent flights. These are preliminary data, in that this method of linguistic analysis is currently being developed and integrated with a content-coding method of communication analysis and models of threat and error.</abstract>"
2000,Russian Federation - United States,Social and cultural issues during Shuttle/Mir space missions,"<title>Social and cultural issues during Shuttle/Mir space missions</title> <abstract>A number of interpersonal issues relevant to manned space missions have been identified from the literature. These include crew tension, cohesion, leadership, language and cultural factors, and displacement. Ground-based studies by others and us have clarified some of the parameters of these issues and have indicated ways in which they could be studied during actual space missions. In this paper, we summarize some of our findings related to social and cultural issues from a NASA-funded study conducted during several Shuttle/Mir space missions. We used standardized mood and group climate measures that were completed on a weekly basis by American and Russian crew and mission control subjects who participated in these missions. Our results indicated that American subjects reported more dissatisfaction with their interpersonal environment than their Russian counterparts, especially American astronauts. Mission control personnel were more dysphoric than crewmembers, but both groups were significantly less dysphoric than other work groups on Earth. Countermeasures based on our findings are discussed which can be applied to future multicultural space missions.</abstract>"

2000,China,Effects of acute mild and moderate hypoxia on human mood state.,"<title>Effects of acute mild and moderate hypoxia on human mood state.</title> <abstract>Objective: To explore the effects of acute mild and moderate hypoxia on human mood state. Method: The mood states of 18 healthy male volunteers were evaluated by self-assessment questionnaires, profile of mood state (POMS) and state anxiety inventory (S-AI) after random exposure to simulated altitude of 300 m (control), 2800 m, 3600 m and 4400 m for 1 h in a hypobaric chamber. Result: The data at 300 m level were taken as the baseline control. The negative mood state factor points (tension, fatigue etc.) increased gradually as the altitude level increased while V (vigor-activity) points had a tendency to decrease (P<0.05 or P<0.01). No significant difference was found in the points of (D, A) even under exposure to 4400 m (P>0.05). At the early period of 2800 m exposure the tension points of POMS and S-AI scores were higher than those of control level (P<0.05) then dropped to baseline level when exposure to this altitude for 1 h. Conclusion: Exposure to acute mild hypobaric hypoxia at 2800 m for 1 h has adverse effect on mood state of healthy person and the negative effect was further aggravated with the increment of altitude level.</abstract>"

Work stress appeared related mainly to mental charge, aggravated by time pressure and high responsibility. Shiftwork was not considered highly stressful, thanks to the good shift schedules adopted. The disorders most frequently complained of had a prevalent psychosomatic component, concerning the digestive, neuropsychic, and cardiovascular systems. However, their prevalence was lower than, or similar to, that recorded in general population. The controllers engaged in regional centres showed slightly worse health conditions than those engaged in airport towers; the same was found in the radar controllers compared to those working in non-radar positions. © 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1999,United States,Aviation human factors: A framework for the new millennium,"<title>Aviation human factors: A framework for the new millennium</title> <abstract>This paper presents a survey of the literature on human factors in airline safety and builds a conceptual framework for designing future safety studies. In our framework, factors are analyzed to determine their association with operational errors rather than accidents. Since operational errors occur with much greater frequency than accidents, our new approach allows for the analysis of the more complex relationships and interactions that occur among various factors. Results generated through the analysis of operational data can enhance the decision-making process and help reduce pilot-error accidents. We also include recommendations for how data should be collected and stored in order for researchers to more effectively analyze flight safety data.</abstract>"
1999,United States,Determinants of enlisted air traffic controller success,"<title>Determinants of enlisted air traffic controller success</title> <abstract>Background: This paper provides a brief historical overview of air traffic controller (ATC) selection, reviews current U.S. Air Force (USAF) selection procedures for enlisted ATC trainees, and summarizes the results of three recent studies. Method: Study 1 examined the validity of the operational selection test (i.e., Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or ASVAB) against apprentice-level training performance. Study 2 evaluated the impact of alternative selection procedures on training attrition and eligibility for training. Study 3 reviewed the results of a survey of enlisted ATCs designed to identify the personnel characteristics and organizational factors that influence training and job performance. Discussion: The current selection composite demonstrated acceptable validity for predicting apprentice-level training performance. Alternative cut-score analyses revealed that raising the minimum qualifying score in order to reduce attrition by 5% would lead to an unacceptable 20% reduction in the number of eligible ATC candidates. Using a different ASVAB composite for selection would have less overall impact on the qualification rate, but would disproportionally disqualify women. Results of a survey of enlisted ATCs indicated they were generally satisfied and motivated. In addition, they identified several abilities required for on-the-job performance that are not measured by current USAF selection methods. These included memorization and retention of new information, spatial orientation/visualization, ability to work well in stressful environments, ability to shift between two or more sources of information, and ability to combine and organize information. Implications for ATC selection and training as well as future research directions are discussed.</abstract>"
1999,Australia - United Kingdom,Does over-accommodation occur when using aircraft head-up displays?,"<title>Does over-accommodation occur when using aircraft head-up displays?</title> <abstract>Background: Whether over-accommodation is caused by the use of head-up displays is still under debate. Most prior experimentation has involved cognitively demanding tasks, which are known to affect the accommodation response. The simulations have often been unrealistic and involved short working distances. Hypothesis: Over-accommodation is caused not by the presence of a head-up display per se, but rather by the cognitive demand of the task. Methods: The effect of increasing the task cognitive load and the use of forward looking infra-red imagery (FLIR) on the ocular accommodative response and task performance was assessed with a realistic head-up display assisted flying task. FLIR increases cognitive load due to its poor resolution and the need for interpretation of the images. Results: Over- accommodation was found to be small in magnitude (0.17 ± 0.03D; range - 0.02-0.45D) occurring only with cognitively demanding tasks and with forward looking infrared imagery. Response times to detect tanks in the outside world scene were slower with increased cognitive load and forward looking infra- red imagery, along with a reduced detection rate, decreased accuracy of tracking tanks in the outside world and poorer control of the head-up display pitch ladder. When discrimination was added to detection in an outside world task, decisions were delayed until they could be accurately made, rather than performance degraded. Conclusion: The use of a virtual head-up display in a simulated aircraft environment did not adversely affect ocular accommodation. However, increased cognitive demand or FLIR imagery caused significant inward shifts of accommodation.</abstract>"
1999,Finland,Neuroendocrine responses and psychomotor test results in subjects participating in military pilot selection,"<title>Neuroendocrine responses and psychomotor test results in subjects participating in military pilot selection</title> <abstract>Background: Military flying sets high demands on the mental performance and stress tolerance of pilots. Neuroendocrine responses could be a method for evaluating stress tolerance. Methods: Psychological workload and neuroendocrine responses associated with the psychomotor Wiener's test were studied in 80 male volunteers. These personnel had applied for the basic military flying program of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). After the first blood sample at 0930 h, the subjects were randomly assigned to test (n = 40) and control groups (n = 40). The test group performed the psychomotor test, which lasted 10 min. The second blood sample was collected 1 min after the test. The control group was clinically examined and the blood sample was taken in the same way. Results: A high plasma ACTH level before the psychomotor test predicted (r = 0.36, p = 0.02) a poor overall result in the psychomotor test. After the psychomotor test, plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and β- endorphin levels were significantly higher than before the test. They were also higher than in the control group. Plasma cortisol and prolactin levels increased after the psychomotor test, but the increase was not statistically significant. High ACTH, cortisol and prolactin increments were specific to a high amount of delayed (over 2 s) psychomotor responses, as a marker of information overload. Conclusions: Elevated plasma ACTH, cortisol and prolactin levels, after the psychomotor test, were associated with a high amount of the delayed responses. This indicates that high neuroendocrine responses were connected with problems in stress tolerance during information processing. High neuroendocrine reactions under information load could, therefore, be used for identification of lowered stress tolerance.</abstract>"
1999,Finland,Neuroendocrine responses to psychological workload of instrument flying in student pilots,"<title>Neuroendocrine responses to psychological workload of instrument flying in student pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Information processing and stress tolerance are necessary features for instrument flying (IRF), especially among student pilots. Psychological workload of IFR flight may lead to stress reactions such as neuroendocrine activity. Methods: Neuroendocrine responses to an IFR flight with Vinka piston-engined primary trainer were studied in 35 male volunteers who participated in the basic military flying course of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). The student pilots performed a 40-min IFR flight mission and a control session on land in randomized order between 11.00 h and 15.00 h. The IFR flight included 3 NDB approaches and was evaluated by flight instructors. Blood samples were collected 15 min before, 5 min and 60 min after the flight as well as control session, and. Plasma ACTH, β-endorphin (BE), cortisol, prolactin, adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) were measured. Psychological evaluations included psychomotor test (Wiener), Multi Coordination and Attention Test, ability tests and personality tests (CMPS and 16 PF). The overall psychological evaluation was made by an aviation psychologist. Results: Plasma ACTH was significantly higher before and 5 min after the flight compared with control levels, but plasma BE increased significantly only before the flight. Plasma cortisol was significantly elevated before and 5 min after the flight. Plasma prolactin. NA and A increases were significant 5 min after the flight. High A levels after the flight correlated significantly with poor IFR flight performance as well as with poor psychomotor test results. Conclusions: The plasma prolactin and NA increases after the flight represented a direct type of stress reaction to the flight situation. The plasma BE response to IFR flight was an anticipatory stress reaction, but plasma ACTH, cortisol and A responses included both anticipatory and direct types of stress reactions. Psychological factors, flight performance and neuroendocrine responses to IFR flight appear to be associated with each other. Therefore, neuroendocrine reactions as a response to the psychological workload of military flying could be used for identifying stress tolerance in military pilots.</abstract>"

To describe all sleep episodes and the recovery process across 4 days, and to relate adjustment to individual differences, 49 Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) air crew were monitored for 9 days with activity monitors and sleep/wake diary before-during-after flight. The outbound flight involved a period of wakefulness extended to 21 h, frequently (87% of air crew) terminated by a long nap in Tokyo which was calm but difficult to wake up from. Then followed two night oriented sleep periods of normal length but of reduced efficiency, containing many and long awakenings. Napping was common during the extended periods of wakefulness, particularly during flights. During the recovery days, ease of rising from sleep in the mornings was difficult throughout, and feelings of not being refreshed returned to baseline levels on the third recovery sleep. Elevated daytime sleepiness (24% of the day) was observed on the first recovery day. No individual differences related to gender, age or position (cabin/pilot) was found in sleep strategy. Poor adjusters, subjects with a perceived lowered capacity on recovery days, showed more premature awakenings abroad and less refreshing sleep during the last 12 months, suggesting a decreased ability to cope with air crew scheduling. Comparisons with a westbound flight showed the eastbound flight layover sleep to be more problematic and containing more napping.</abstract>"
1999,United Kingdom,Drinking and flying: A structural model,<title>Drinking and flying: A structural model</title> <abstract>Background: Under a recent revision of the European Joint Aviation Authorities operations regulations it has been prohibited to act as a crew member of an aircraft with a BAC of greater than 0.02%. Methods: This survey of UK Civil Aviation Authority pilots suggests that over 50% of respondents may have flown an aircraft with a BAC of greater than this prescribed amount. Results: Professional pilots were found to be heavier drinkers than private pilots and were also more likely to infringe the 0.02% BAC rule. Conclusion: Analysis of the data using path analysis suggests that professional pilots may be more prone to offending as a result of training in a 'drinking culture' and as a response to commercial pressures in the industry.</abstract>

1999,United States,The effect of moderate levels of simulated altitude on sustained cognitive performance,"<title>The effect of moderate levels of simulated altitude on sustained cognitive performance</title> <abstract>Previous work has documented cognitive deficits at high altitudes (15,000-25,000 ft), but there is controversy for lower altitudes. This study looked at the effects of moderate altitudes - 12,500 ft and 15,000 ft - on short-term memory in comparison to 2,000 ft. Seventy-two student pilots and instructors were first administered the Vocabulary, Digit Span, and Digit Symbol subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test, and the near-contrast sensitivity portion of the Vistech VCTS 6000 chart. Participants then spent 11/2 hr at their designated altitude for cognitive testing. Participants performed a 30-min vigilance task while listening to an audiotape with instructions to recall radio calls prefaced by their assigned call sign. Half of the radio calls were high memory loads (at least 4 pieces of information), and half were low memory loads (no more than 2 pieces of information). No effects of altitude were found in performance on the Vigilance task. However, for readbacks of high memory load, significant deficits in recall were observed at 12,500 ft and 15,000 ft, whereas no effect of altitude was observed on recall of readbacks with low memory loads. These results indicate that, at altitude, short-term memory was exceeded for the readbacks requiring a larger amount of information to be recalled, and that cognitive deficits are found at lower altitudes than previously observed.</abstract>"
1999,Netherlands,Pilot's perception in the control of aircraft motions,"<title>Pilot's perception in the control of aircraft motions</title> <abstract>For proper manual aircraft control, the pilot has to perceive the motion state of the aircraft.

1999,Russian Federation,Psychophysiological monitoring under conditions of real and simulated microgravity.,"<title>Psychophysiological monitoring under conditions of real and simulated microgravity.</title> <abstract>Dynamics of indices characterizing the process of adaptation of operators to complicated conditions of vital activity was studied with psychophysiological monitoring. This technique is based on the complex analysis of subjective and objective estimations of the current psychoemotional state and physiological and biochemical indices. We analyzed the data obtained during the examination of three healthy volunteers, who participated in the HUBES experiment (135-day isolation in the ground-based model of the orbital station ""Mir""), and during a biorhythmological study conducted by six Russian cosmonauts of the main expeditions on the station ""Mir."" It was shown that psychophysiological monitoring is an informative method for studying different parameters of the operator's state and regulatory processes, the dynamics of biological rhythms, and individual characteristics of adaptation. By means of the analysis of a population of the variation in the characteristics of the parameters under study the experimental period of isolation was divided into three stages. The first and third stages were characterized by a relatively high variability, which was minimized at the second stage. The phasic character of the adaptation processes with a phase duration of about 60 days was revealed and a correlation was shown between the dynamics of parameters obtained by means of psychophysiological monitoring and specific features of the system regulation in different phases of the space flight and its simulation. It is suggested that the phases of the minimal variability of the studied characteristics are related to the periods of the minimal reliability of an operator's work.

1999,Germany,Human performance during spaceflight.,"<title>Human performance during spaceflight.</title> <abstract>The paper focuses on three different questions: (1) What attributes cause space to be an extreme environment for humans? (2) What do we know about mental performance during spaceflight? (3) What kinds of psychological countermeasures are currently applied and/or conceivable for prolonged spaceflight which might help maintain mental efficiency and stabilize the emotional state of astronauts? Topics discussed include stressors that originate in the space environment, stressors related to the space habitat and its life-support system, stressors related to the mission specific workload of astronauts, stressors that arise from the psychosocial situation in a space habitat, manual performance during spaceflight, and psychological countermeasures for prolonged spaceflight.</abstract>"

1999,United States,Psychological and behavioral health issues of long-duration space missions.,"<title>Psychological and behavioral health issues of long-duration space missions.</title> <abstract>It will be the responsibility of the long-duration space flight crew to take the actions necessary to maintain their health and well-being and to cope with medical emergencies without direct assistance from support personnel, including maintaining mental health and managing physiological and psychological changes that may impair decision making and performance. The Behavior and Performance Integrated Product Team at Johnson Space Center, working within the Space Medicine, Monitoring, and Countermeasures Program, has identified critical questions pertaining to long-duration space crew behavioral health, psychological adaptation, human factors and habitability, and sleep and circadian rhythms. Among the projects addressing these questions are: the development of tools to assess cognitive functions during space missions; the development of a model of psychological adaptation in isolated and confined environments; tools and methods for selecting individuals and teams well-suited for long-duration missions; identification of mission-critical tasks and performance evaluation; and measures of sleep quality and correlation to mission performance.</abstract>"

1999,Germany - United Kingdom,Multiple-task performance on a computer-simulated life support system during a space mission simulation,"<title>Multiple-task performance on a computer-simulated life support system during a space mission simulation</title> <abstract>This paper presents an experiment which examined the effects of isolation and confinement during a simulation of a short-term space mission. During the 7-day spaceflight simulation, four Canadian astronauts were tested daily on a 30-min performance task. The task, CAMS (Cabin Air Management System), represents a computer-based simulation of a generic life support system. As a multiple-task environment, it allows the measurement of a wide range of task management variables such as primary and secondary task performance, and system control activities. Measures of subjective state variables were also taken. The results did not show any evidence of serious performance decrements for any crew member. The analysis revealed different adjustment patterns with which crew members responded as a function of mission duration and variations in workload. Among the secondary tasks employed, prospective memory was found to be more sensitive than reaction time to increases in workload. The paper concludes with a discussion of the utility of spaceflight simulations and computer-based simulations of space work.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Measures and interpretations of vigilance performance: Evidence against the detection criterion,"<title>Measures and interpretations of vigilance performance: Evidence against the detection criterion</title> <abstract>Operators' performance in a vigilance task is often assumed to depend on their choice of a detection criterion. When the signal rate is low this criterion is set high, causing the hit and false alarm rates to be low. With increasing time on task the criterion presumably tends to increase even further, thereby further decreasing the hit and false alarm rates. Virtually all of the empirical evidence for this simple interpretation is based on estimates of the bias measure β from signal detection theory. In this article, I describe a new approach to studying decision making that does not require the technical assumptions of signal detection theory. The results of this new analysis suggest that the detection criterion is never biased toward either response, even when the signal rate is low and the time on task is long. Two modifications of the signal detection theory framework are considered to account for this seemingly paradoxical result. The first assumes that the signal rate affects the relative sizes of the variances of the information distributions; the second assumes that the signal rate affects the logic of the operator's stopping rule. Actual or potential applications of this research include the improved training and performance assessment of operators in areas such as product quality control, air traffic control, and medical and clinical diagnosis.</abstract>"
1998,China,Characteristics of nystagmus and illusion evoked by optokinetic stimuli,"<title>Characteristics of nystagmus and illusion evoked by optokinetic stimuli</title> <abstract>To study the characteristics of human psychophysiological responses to optokinetic stimulus, 30 male medical students were given a series of optokinetic step stimulus (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 deg/sec) (clockwise). Each stimulus lasted for 20 seconds. Optokinetic nystagmus was recorded on tape. At the same time, the latency and estimated fuzzy magnitude of the illusion were noted down. The nystagmus was analysed with a computer system of ENG and the magnitude of illusion was measured with a fuzzy set model. The results are: 1. Both the slow velocity (SV) and fast velocity (FV) of optokinetic nystagmus increase as stimulus speeds up and reaches their peaks at 60 deg/sec, which remains constant from 60 to 120 deg/sec. 2. From 5 to 120 deg/sec, the magnitude of optokinetic illusion increases linearly as stimulus speeds up. Optokinetic illusion and optokinetic nystagmus are human psychophysiological responses to the same optokinetic stimulus, they are different in trend of change, and when optokinetic stimulus is at 60-120 deg/sec, illusion response is more stable than nystagmus response.</abstract>"
1998,,The history of the united states navy flight surgeon/naval aviator program,"<title>The history of the united states navy flight surgeon/naval aviator program</title> <abstract>Early in the history of aviation the need for a special kind of physician who could understand the physical and psychological problems encountered by flyers was well recognized. These physicians were called flight surgeons. In 1922, RADM W. A. Moffett, USN, the first Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and the ""Father of Naval Aviation,"" called for a group of Navy medical officers to be trained as flight surgeons. He believed that all Navy flight surgeons should be trained as pilots ""primarily in order that they may experience the emergencies and conditions that arise in flying."" This article traces the history of the Navy flight surgeon/naval aviator.

In spite of a random relationship between all slide categories and outcome (illusory correlation), flight phobics exhibited a covariation bias and showed higher CEs for the contingency between FR slides and shocks than for the contingency between FI slides and shocks in a first experimental block. The CEs of flight phobics for FR slides and shocks was significantly higher than that of non-flight-phobic individuals, while high- and low-fear participants did not differ in their CEs for the other slide- shock combinations. However, even high-fear individuals were able to correct their initial covariation bias in subsequent illusory correlation blocks, presumably based on disconfirming situational information.</abstract>"

1998,United States,Compulsive sexual behaviors - Difficult aeromedical disposition,"<title>Compulsive sexual behaviors - Difficult aeromedical disposition</title> <abstract>Axis I psychiatric disorders generally are considered incompatible with both the issuance and subsequent maintenance of aeromedical clearance certificates. Little doubt exists as to the impact that conditions such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or substance-related disorders have on the conduct of safe flight. Nevertheless, different compulsive sexual behaviors (CSBs), which now are thought to share similar origins and associated comorbidity, can similarly affect impulse control, judgment, concentration, and insight. Yet, these conditions frequently are handled administratively (if not legally). Moreover, in practice CSBs fall within a spectrum of behaviors from 'normative' nonparaphilic sexuality to more deviant paraphilic behavior. Through the presentation of five selected cases seen at the Naval Operational Medicine Institute, this article explores examiner difficulty in establishing a diagnosis, discusses models useful in understanding the origins of these disorders, and highlights critical elements in establishing aeromedical disposition. The authors conclude that CSBs may be associated with anxiety, dysphoria, a pattern of increased risk taking, a high threshold for arousal, and poor judgment, which may impact the safety of flight. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential in determining aeromedical disposition, and consideration should be given to reviewing these cases from a medical perspective prior to any administrative disposition.</abstract>"

1998,United States,Effect of G suit type on cognitive performance,"<title>Effect of G suit type on cognitive performance</title> <abstract>Background: Sustained acceleration protection ensembles are being developed to help pilots of high performance aircraft endure high G exposures for longer periods of time. It has been assumed that better G endurance confers better pilot task performance. This premise was studied on the Armstrong Laboratory Dynamic Environment Simulator centrifuge. Method: Human subjects repeatedly endured prolonged high-G simulated aerial combat on a centrifuge to the point of loss of vision or physical exhaustion. Some profiles included over 20 exposures to +9 Gz. While enduring the G exposures, subjects tracked a simulated 'bogey' aircraft on a visual display and performed a secondary task. Measures of cognitive function and physiologic status were taken throughout the exposures. G protection ensembles included the standard CSU 13 B/P anti-G suit, the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS), COMBAT EDGE positive pressure breathing system with the CSU 13 B/P, COMBAT EDGE with ATAGS, and the Northrop Advanced Protection System (APS). Results: More advanced protective systems not only allow longer G endurance, but provide adequate support for maintained cognitive performance throughout the extended exposure. Although measures were affected by the type of protective system the subject was wearing, as well as individual ability and coping strategies, consistent target tracking task performance, rapid choice reaction time, and sufficient arterial oxygen saturation were maintained throughout extended exposures to a point preceding termination by only a second or two. Conclusions: Those anti-G protection ensembles that cover and protect the body and which employ positive pressure breathing allow longer high G exposures which provide support for maintained cognitive performance.</abstract>"
1998,Germany,Part three: Circadian rhythms and activity-rest cycle under different CO2 concentrations,"<title>Part three: Circadian rhythms and activity-rest cycle under different CO2 concentrations</title> <abstract>Background: During manned space missions, the actual concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) is frequently elevated to a degree that may affect human functioning and productivity. Therefore, a ground-based international study was performed that tested various psychological and physiological functions under the condition of two different levels of CO<inf>2</inf>. Thus, a specific experiment aimed at the influence of enhanced CO<inf>2</inf>-concentrations on the sleep-wake cycle and the circadian system. Methods: Four volunteers were subjected to a CO<inf>2</inf> concentration of 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, for 24 consecutively days under each condition. Before they were exposed to these elevated levels, baseline measurements were conducted during 5 d under ambient CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations (<0.1%). Circadian parameters were assessed by continuous recording of body temperature and by the determination of excretion rates of cortisol, 6-hydroximelatoninsulfate and catecholamines at 3-h intervals during wake. These measurements were conducted on 3 consecutive days 4 times during the two campaigns. Nondominant wrist activity and subjective fatigue was monitored throughout both study phases. Results: Daily means of activity showed significant differences between the two study conditions (with lower values during the 1.2% condition), but these differences only occurred during day-time, whereas during sleep activity levels remained the same. Diurnal mean and circadian amplitude of the temperature rhythm was also significantly lower during the 1.2% condition. Conclusions: The lower daily mean and circadian amplitudes of temperature during the higher CO<inf>2</inf> level can be explained by lower physical activity that was monitored under this level, i.e., a masking effect. We hesitate to explain the lower activity (and hence temperature) as a response to the changed CO<inf>2</inf> concentration. More probably, subjects became so acquainted with the procedures of the study protocol during the second study phase (1.2% CO<inf>2</inf>) that they did not need similar effort to conduct the tasks as during the first phase. The activity level during sleep which was the same during the two phases may support this conclusions. Thus, we conclude that CO<inf>2</inf> levels up to 1.2% do not impair the circadian rhythm of healthy men.</abstract>"

1998,United States,Immunosuppression during spaceflight deconditioning,"<title>Immunosuppression during spaceflight deconditioning</title> <abstract>Spaceflight results in immunosuppression which is likely due mainly to neurohumoral factors released in response to intermittent stress effects during flight. However, no major non-physiological health problems have been reported during or following spaceflight, but diseases resulting from immunosuppression could occur on long-duration missions and would include bacterial, fungal, and vital infections in addition to increased incidence of neoplasia and autoimmunity. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics appear to be altered during spaceflight and, as a consequence, alternative drug administration and dosing procedures will need to be developed. Moderate exercise training enhances immune function, but in-flight exercise may affect immunological parameters and immunity in ways not yet ascertained. Hyperosmolality may enhance some immune parameters, and attenuate others especially when associated with dehydration and exercise. Reducing in-flight stress may attenuate flight-induced immunosuppression, but pharmacological interventions may be essential to prevent undesirable immune responses which may occur on long-duration missions to Mars.</abstract>"
1998,,Statements in disability application become issue in HIV firing.,"<title>Statements in disability application become issue in HIV firing.</title> <abstract>A California appeals court heard oral arguments on whether a worker forced out of a job can still sue his employer for HIV discrimination after applying for disability benefits. The case involved a Wells Fargo bank employee, Anthony Bell, who received accommodations from his manager at the bank, but was forced out of a job when a new manager revoked his working arrangements. Bell argued that the arrangement, working four days and working from home, were needed as a reasonable accommodation. Bell applied for three types of disability benefits, unemployment, Social Security, and long-term disability. Rather than addressing the Federal cases, the case was filed under California's Fair Housing Act. To resolve the issue, the justices would rely on Prilliman v. United Air Lines, in which the court found that receiving disability benefits by itself does not prove that an airline pilot who was fired after he was diagnosed with AIDS is incapable of performing other jobs with the airline. The court must decide whether Bell should be estopped because of statements he made on his disability benefits applications.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Operational psychology countermeasures during the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project.,"<title>Operational psychology countermeasures during the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project.</title> <abstract>The Crew and Thermal Systems Division at the NASA Johnson Space Center conducted a series of human-rated tests, termed the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project (LMLSTP), designed to advance technology in closed life support systems. As the duration of these tests lengthened, the psychological factors associated with placing humans in these environments became increasingly salient to successful mission completion. A number of psychological activities were conducted to ensure successful operations and protect crew member well-being, including individual crew member selection, crew composition, training and preparation, family inclusion, educational briefings, in-mission tracking, operational interventions, and postmission repatriation. This article describes these activities, the rationale behind their design, the similarities and differences to techniques utilized for spaceflight, and considerations related to designing psychological countermeasures for confined environments. In addition to testing physical and engineering systems, the LMLSTP series functioned as an effective testbed for developing operational concepts and countermeasures for extended space missions.</abstract>"

This study examined effects on these parameters as a function of altitude level and duration of exposure by administering standardized tests from 1 to 3 times to 23 males in an altitude chamber during 4.5-hour exposures to 3 levels of hypobaric hypoxia: 500 m, 4,200 m, and 4,700 m. Exposure to altitude significantly affected symptoms, moods, and performance in an elevation-dependent fashion. Adverse changes increased with higher altitudes (all measures were affected at 4,700 m, whereas only some were at 4,200 m) and usually with longer durations. Therefore, specific aspects of symptoms, moods, and performance are significantly degraded after only a few hours of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia, and the severity of the effects dramatically increases when testing is conducted at 4,700 m compared to 4,200 m.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Evaluation of retention of safety and survival training content versus industry standard for training,"<title>Evaluation of retention of safety and survival training content versus industry standard for training</title> <abstract>Introduction: The accepted standard in the industry for survival and safety training is annual recurrent educational programs. The industry has never looked at nor tested content comprehension or retention on this subject. We decided to conduct a sample testing of crews' ability to understand and retain survival training material. Methods: This study solicited the participation of four program crews that had received previous training in safety and survival. A test on safety and survival training content was administrated to nurses and paramedics before a refresher course (test 1), then immediately after the course (test 2), and again 6 months later (test 3). Ninety-six crew members took tests 1 and 2, and 79 (82%) took test 3. Results: The average time since any crew member participating in this study had attended a survival course was 1 to 1.5 years, the pretraining test mean score was 60 (60%); the posttraining average score was 92 (92%); and the 6-month mean score was 65 (65%). Conclusion: Flight crews do not retain a safe level of survival skill knowledge with annual recurrent training. Therefore the industry needs to reevaluate its position on this standard of annual recurrent training. Survival training is too important for flight crews to undertake only once per year.

1998,United States,Habitability and performance issues for long duration space flights.,"<title>Habitability and performance issues for long duration space flights.</title> <abstract>Advancing technology, coupled with the desire to explore space has resulted in increasingly longer manned space missions. Although the Long Duration Space Flights (LDSF) have provided a considerable amount of scientific research on human ability to function in extreme environments, findings indicate long duration missions take a toll on the individual, both physiologically and psychologically. These physiological and psychological issues manifest themselves in performance decrements; and could lead to serious errors endangering the mission, spacecraft and crew. The purpose of this paper is threefold: 1) to document existing knowledge of the effects of LDSF on performance, habitability, and workload, 2) to identify and assess potential tools designed to address these decrements, and 3) to propose an implementation plan to address these habitability, performance and workload issues.</abstract>"

The authors propose that many instances of superordinate and subordinate behavior in the cockpit-the captain's tendency to reject input from other team members and the first officer's hesitancy to question the captain-represent cases of status generalization. First, the authors describe the theory of status generalization and show support for the operation of the theory by presenting examples of flightcrew behavior that the theory predicts. Second, an initial empirical test was conducted to instantiate the claim that captain-first officer differences can be seen as status differences. Finally, the significance and implications of this perspective are discussed.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Structured methods for identifying and correcting potential human errors in space operations,"<title>Structured methods for identifying and correcting potential human errors in space operations</title> <abstract>Human performance plays a significant role in the development and operation of any complex system, and human errors are significant contributors to degraded performance, incidents, and accidents for technologies as diverse as medical systems, commercial aircraft, offshore oil platforms, nuclear power plants, and space systems. To date, serious accidents attributed to human error have fortunately been rare in space operations. However, as flight rates go up and the duration of space missions increases, the accident rate could increase unless proactive action is taken to identify and correct potential human errors in space operations. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has developed and applied structured methods of human error analysis to identify potential human errors, assess their effects on system performance, and develop strategies to prevent the errors or mitigate their consequences. These methods are being applied in NASA-sponsored programs to the domain of commercial aviation, focusing on airplane maintenance and air traffic management The application of human error analysis to space operations could contribute to minimize the risks associated with human error in the design and operation of future space systems. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1998,France,Interpersonal relationships in isolation and confinement: Long-term bed rest in head-down tilt position,"<title>Interpersonal relationships in isolation and confinement: Long-term bed rest in head-down tilt position</title> <abstract>The long-term bed-rest was organized by ESA and CNES, in order to simulate the physiological effects of weightlessness : eight volunteers had to stay 42 days in bed, in a head down tilt position (- 6°). There were two subjects in a room, they could not be alone and it was difficult for them to have their own personal space and intimacy. In these circumstances, as in outer space, interpersonal relationships were of prime importance. This situation enabled us, through systematic observation, to analyze the evolution of the relational behavior in dyads, and to quote some social indicators of adaptation. Results show significant withdrawal, and the time spent alone was marked by the emergence, during the experiment, of specific preferential activities. Behavioral contagion was observed in each dyad (people engaged in the same activities at the same time), except in the one case of abandon. Moreover, the highest rates of inactivity and withdrawal were noted in this case. Verbal indicators were useful to comment these results and showed that, for all the dyads, one of the two subjects always played a regulating role by expressing a very positive perception of the situation. These results emphasize the importance of psycho-sociological factors in isolation and confinement. Thus, it appears that different modalities of interpersonal relationships, and not only verbal interactions, play a significant role in adaptation to stress situations. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Six years ago a longitudinal study was begun to track the psychological profiles of perfusionists. Surgeons can repair cardiac defects only after a beating heart has been stopped. In order for the brain and other organs to survive cardiac surgery, they must be perfused with well oxygenated blood. As a result, the life of every cardiac surgery patient literally sits in the hands of the cardiac perfusionist. The stress of placing patients on and off the 'pump' is one that is experienced by cardiovascular perfusionists on a daily basis. This stress has been likened to that of air traffic controllers who continually prepare planes for take off and/or landing. In the 6 years between studies, medical technologists have changed very little psychologically. They remain very well balanced. However, there have been significant changes in their interpersonal behaviours. Instead of the 'well-balanced' interpersonal profiles of 6 years ago, there is a higher degree of assertiveness/aggressiveness being reported. Managed Care has begun to impact interpersonal behaviours but has not yet altered the more resilient platform of internal psychological balance.</abstract>"
1998,Finland,Noise Exposure of Fighter Pilots and Ground Technicians during Flight Rounds,"<title>Noise Exposure of Fighter Pilots and Ground Technicians during Flight Rounds</title> <abstract>The noise inside the cockpit and on the platform is high during the operation of a jet fighter. Although short-term noise measurements have been done for almost all fighters, platforms and airports, there is little information on the long-term exposure of pilots and technicians. Noise was measured in the following types of Finnish fighters: Hornet F-18, Saab 35 Draken, Mig 21 Bis, jet trainer BA Hawk MK-51 and basic trainers. The pilots used Gentex helmets in the F-18, a FFV Flyghjälm helmet in the Draken, a ZSH-5A helmet in the Mig and an Alpha helmet in the Hawk, Vinka and Redigo. The noise exposures were evaluated by noise dose meters and tape-recording systems outside and inside the flight helmet. The averaged values for the pilots varied over the flight in the cockpit from 96 to 100 dB and in the ear canal from 88 to 95 dB The highest values were measured in Mig 21 Bis fighters. The analyses indicated that radio noise, as measured equivalent noise, is 4-10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. According to the audiometric data of this study a pilot with an average of 600 hours of flying time should not be at risk of hearing loss. However, noise can still influence flight safety parameters and other physiological or psychological effects. Over a day, the technicians received surprisingly similar noise exposures, varying from 93 to 97 dB. The start values were highest (108 dB L<inf>Aeq15min</inf>) for F-18 and Hawk planes, which use an auxiliary starting motor. If the earmuffs in use were able to reduce the fighter noise by 30 dB, the daily exposure of technicians would vary from 63 to 67 dB, and, if the A-weighted instantaneous sound pressure levels vary from 110 to 120dB on the platform, then the maximum noise levels entering the ear canal would be 80-90dB.</abstract>"

Within its framework an error is considered in psychophysiological aspect as consequence of cosmonaut ""psychophysiological troubles"" caused by combined effect of flight extreme conditions on his/her organism. This approach was used for the investigation of interrelation between cosmonauts errors, their psychophysiological state and work-rest schedule peculiarities. It includes procedures of expert analysis of data received in the course of radio and TV sessions with crew, analysis of timelines as well deviations in ""crew-spacecraft"" system functioning. These data are accumulated, systematized and processed in data base. Realization of the suggested approach does not require specialized onboard equipment and crew members time expenditure. Some results of inflight data analysis are presented to illustrate its potentials. ©1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

Major psychosocial factors that have been described in anecdotal reports from space and in studies from analog situations on Earth include: 1) crew heterogeneity due to gender differences, cultural issues, and work experiences and motivations; 2) language and dialect variations; and 3) task versus supportive leadership roles. All of these factors can lead to negative sequelae, such as intra-crew tension and cohesion disruptions. Specific sequelae that can result from single factors include subgrouping and scapegoating due to crew heterogeneity; miscommunication due to major or subtle language differences; and role confusion, competition, and status leveling due to inappropriate leadership role definition. It is time to conduct research exploring the impact of these psychosocial factors and their sequelae on space crews during actual long-duration international space missions. ©1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The question addressed was: do reports produced by these procedures differ with respect to complexity and reliability? Following repeated (within-day and across-day) exposures to 4 different ""motion profiles,"" subjects either (a) selected movies presented on a laptop computer, or (b) selected written descriptions from a booklet, or (c) generated self-motion verbal descriptions that corresponded most closely with their motion experience. One ""complexity"" and 2 reliability ""scores"" were calculated. Contrary to expectations, reliability and complexity scores were essentially equivalent for the animation movie selection and written report selection procedures. Verbal report generation subjects exhibited less complexity than did subjects in the other conditions and their reports were often ambiguous. The results suggest that, when selecting from carefully written descriptions and following appropriate training, people may be better able to describe their self-motion experience with words than is usually believed. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1998,France - Russian Federation,Study of the psychological adaptation of the crew during a 135 days space simulation,"<title>Study of the psychological adaptation of the crew during a 135 days space simulation</title> <abstract>The purpose of this study is to examine human adaptation of a three members' crew during a 135 days MIR flight simulation and to compare and validate psychological methods for monitoring and support in flight. The main findings showed that isolation was not a key factor for the subjects who were more concerned by recreational activities, family, and work. The individual reactions to stress of the crew members were to project their problems on the others. These reactions had some consequences upon the group: Although the three subjects developed a weak tendency to « group think », one of the crew members was considered as less integrated to the group by the other two subjects, who, however, acted to protect (successfully) the general cohesion and mood of the crew. From a methodological point of view, baseline data predicted the difficulties that occurred for one of the crew member. Both quantitative and qualitative tools were adequate, although qualitative tests gave a closer approach to the actual situation that developed during the simulation. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1998,United States,Evaluating individual differences in response to time-pressure situations,"<title>Evaluating individual differences in response to time-pressure situations</title> <abstract>The ability to make decisions within a few seconds to a couple of minutes is the hallmark of many applied situations ranging from air traffic control to stock market trading. The 5 studies reported here explore the hypothesis that there are abstract psychological demands common to many rapid decision-making situations. The authors suggest that these characteristics can be used to identify people who are good rapid decision makers. People were trained to operate computer simulations of the job skills involved in air traffic control and 2 aspects of public safety dispatch. Although these tasks are very different on the surface, they all require decision making under time pressure. Performance was successfully predicted from performance on an abstract decision-making task.</abstract>"
1997,Russian Federation - United States,Content analysis of the crew communication with external communicants under prolonged isolation,"<title>Content analysis of the crew communication with external communicants under prolonged isolation</title> <abstract>Background: The communication between space crews and outside monitoring personnel in Mission Control gives us valuable information about crewmember psychological health. Studying the formal parameters of similar communication during ground-based space simulation missions helps us understand the psychological climate of confined groups over time, and this information can be applied to long-term space missions. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that psychological closing and information filtration will be observed in a confined crew as the mission progresses and will differ by the type of communication (e.g., audio vs. computer-generated) with the outside monitors in the simulated Mission Control (MC). In addition, communication patterns will vary with the specific group of people on-duty outside. Method: Audio and computer communications between space simulation crews and MC teams were analyzed during two isolation studies lasting 135 and 90 d at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow. A number of temporal, content and quantitative parameters of verbal activity were examined. Results: The total intensity of communication dropped after month 1 of the missions. The Commander had the highest intensity of communication. There was evidence for the presence of psychological closing and information filtration in the crews over time, with some variation based on type of communication. Communication patterns differed with different outside teams. Conclusions: The communication between confined groups and outside monitoring personnel is affected by psychological closing and information filtration and by the make- up of the teams that comprise the monitoring groups.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Stress in air force aviators facing the combat environment,"<title>Stress in air force aviators facing the combat environment</title> <abstract>Background: This paper evaluates the effect of stress on four squadrons of United States Air Force aviators in tactical high performance aircraft deployed for combat operations compared with U.S. based aircrew using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as the evaluating instrument. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study consisting of 42 aviators in deployed squadrons stationed overseas and involved in a contingency mission, and 15 subjects stationed in the U.S. and not exposed to combat conditions. Each subject was administered the test instrument, which was completed in privacy and with complete anonymity. Results: The hypotheses of interest were: a) the proportion of individuals in the population of fighter aircrew who would report excessive stress is 0; and b) no significant differences would exist in the proportion of individuals with excessive stress in the various squadrons. Using statistical methodology, these hypotheses were rejected. Conclusion: It is concluded that more studies in each given circumstance are necessary.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Interpersonal relationship and prisoner of war concerns of rated military male and female aircrew,"<title>Interpersonal relationship and prisoner of war concerns of rated military male and female aircrew</title> <abstract>Background: The Issue of women flying military aircraft in a combat role has been very controversial. Hypothesis: To succeed female military aircrew are very similar to their male peers. Method: We conducted a comprehensive anonymous questionnaire survey of all U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force rated female aircrew, with an equal number of age and duty matched male aircrew. We are reporting on the interpersonal relationship and prisoner of war (P.O.W.) responses here. Results: Male and female aircrew respond in a similar manner to posed questions, although differences do exist. Women reported: unequal treatment by opposite gender peers; problems relating to peers, superiors and subordinates; their gender influences assignments; the need to perform to higher standards and the need to work harder to be accented as equals; ability to bond equally to their own and opposite gender peers; improved squad-ton cohesiveness in mixed gender squadrons; problems with peers' spouses; and, in a P.O.W. situation, fear of rape and sexual abuse. Men reported: women get inappropriate privileges and get special 'breaks'; a gender difference in how flight duties are performed; worsened squadron cohesiveness in mixed gender squadrons; less likeliness to recommend their career path to their daughters: and a higher concern for welfare of families in a P.O.W. situation. Conclusions: Although responding in a similar manner to most questions male and female military aircrew differ in the perception of their ability to function in mixed squadrons because of their gender. Some of these perceptions can be modified through training, others may need to be resolved through high level orders/policy; while in others the military may have to accept women are different from men in some aspects.</abstract>"
1997,Germany,Two-crew operations: Stress and fatigue during long-haul night flights,"<title>Two-crew operations: Stress and fatigue during long-haul night flights</title> <abstract>Background: As part of a research program concerning legal aspects of two-pilot operations on long-haul routes, the purpose of the study was to investigate two-crew extended range operations during a flight roster with two consecutive night flights and a short layover. Hypothesis: Present flight time regulations may not be adequate for two-crew minimum operations. Methods: The study was conducted in cooperation with a German airline company on the route Frankfurt (FRA)-Mahe (SEZ). There were 11 rotations (22 flights) that were investigated by pre-, in- and post-flight data collection each time from the two pilots. Recordings included sleep, taskload, fatigue and stress by measurement of EEG, ECG, motor activity, and subjective ratings. The average actual flight times were 9:15 h (FRA-SEZ) and 9:53 h (SEZ-FRA). All flights took place at night. The layover duration in Mahe was 13:30 h during daytime. Results: During layover, sleep was shortened by 2 h on average compared with 8-h baseline sleep. The two consecutive night duties resulted in a sleep loss of 9.3 h upon return to home base. Inflight ratings of taskload showed moderate grades, but for fatigue ratings an increasing level was observed. Fatigue was more pronounced during the return flight and several pilots scored, their fatigue at a critical level. Motor activity, brainwave activity (occurrences of micro-events) and heart rate indicated drowsiness and a low state of vigilance and alertness during both night flights, but these effects were more pronounced during the second flight. Conclusions: From the findings it is concluded that a duty roster as conducted in this study, may impose excessive demands on mental and physiological capacity.</abstract>"
1997,Switzerland,Psychophysiological stress research,"<title>Psychophysiological stress research</title> <abstract>This paper gives an overview of physiological stress responses and shows methods for measuring such responses in field studies. It discusses the available techniques for assessing endocrinological and immune functions, cardiovascular functions, physical activity, electrodermal activity, muscle activity, respiration, and, the size of the eye pupil. Furthermore, methods for collecting psychological data are depicted. As examples for psychophysiological stress research under natural conditions, a showmaster's heart rate responses during a TV show are reported, as well as psychophysiological effects of work demands in air traffic controllers and in simultaneous interpreting. The latter example shows that mental overload in simultaneous interpreting may change the attitude to the job: It is taken less seriously and a certain carelessness sets in. This might be an effective self-defense mechanism against mental overload caused by situations such as increased time on task, extremely fast speakers, unintelligible speakers, and long working hours. It seems to occur rather automatically, without being noticed by the performing interpreter. Especially with increased time on task, interpreters’ own judgement of output quality, whether they are novices or experts, seems to become extremely unreliable. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.</abstract>"
1997,Finland,Heart rate responses to real and simulated BA Hawk MK 51 flight,"<title>Heart rate responses to real and simulated BA Hawk MK 51 flight</title> <abstract>Background: The effects of psychological workload on inflight heart rate were studied in five experienced (flight instructors) and five less experienced (cadets) military pilots of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). Method: The subjects performed the same flight mission twice; first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with the BA Hawk MK 51 jet trainer with Gz-forces below +2. The mission included: a) 2 min rest after seating; b) take-off; c) ILS approach in the minimum weather conditions (initial, intermediate and final approach); d) landing tour (visual approach); and e) landing. The heart rates were continuously measured using a small portable recorder developed at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland. The R-R intervals were stored and analyzed with an accuracy of 1 ms. The different phases of each flight were marked in the data by using codes given beforehand for each critical event. Results: The take-off resulted in a significant increase in the heart rate from the resting levels both in the cadets and the flight instructors in both planes. In the simulator the heart rate decreased during the initial approach and slightly increased after it during the intermediate approach. Thereafter the heart rate decreased during the landing tour which seemed to be the least psychologically demanding phase of the simulated flight. The heart rate increased again during the landing but did not exceed the heart rates measured during the take-off and the ILS- approach. There were no statistical differences between the groups. In the jet trainer no decrease in the heart rate could be observed immediately after the take-off, unlike in the case of the simulated flight. The inflight heart rate increased during the final approach, decreased during the landing tour and finally increased during the landing. According to the heart rate analysis the final approach was the most loaded phase of the real flight. The changes towards the phases of final approach and landing were greater among the flight instructors. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between the mean heart rates during the real and the simulated flight. It is suggested that the heart rate changes for most reflected the changes in cognitive workload.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Visual scanning and pilot expertise: The role of attentional flexibility and mental model development,"<title>Visual scanning and pilot expertise: The role of attentional flexibility and mental model development</title> <abstract>In order to examine differences in flying expertise, 12 novice and 12 expert pilots flew a 7-segment simulation pattern under specific: attentional constraints while cockpit instrument visual scan was recorded. Flight segments involved various combinations of maneuvering of heading, altitude and airspeed. Expert pilots performed better than novices on vertical and longitudinal, but not lateral control. They accomplished their superior vertical tracking by allocating more control resources to the vertical control. Analyses of scanning strategies revealed that experts: a) had shorter dwells and more frequent visits to most instruments; b) adapted their visiting strategy more flexibly in response to changing task demands; c) demonstrated a better mental model of cross-coupling and predictive relations between and within axes; and d) showed more frequent checking of axes whose values remained constant. The data is discussed in terms of their implications in pilot cockpit scan training program development.</abstract>"
1997,Germany - United States,Assessment of the anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) skill performance and reinforcement program,"<title>Assessment of the anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) skill performance and reinforcement program</title> <abstract>Initial high-G centrifuge training of USAF fast jet pilots was instituted in 1985. Also, since the mid-1980's, pilot awareness of G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) has been enhanced by briefings, videotapes, and safety articles. Aircraft accidents caused by an improperly performed anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM), however, continue to occur. Deficiencies in the AGSM of pilots in flight have not been systematically studied. A test program to reinforce the proper performance of the AGSM in flight was initiated in the United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) in 1993. Head-up display videotapes (HUD tapes) were recorded during flight and critiqued during debrief by flight leads for AGSM technique and continuity. Questionnaires were completed by F-16, F-15C, and F-15E pilots assigned to USAFE: 78 surveys were completed out of 110 distributed (71%). There were 57 pilots (73%) who reported one or more problems with their AGSM: 33 noted that the timing of their breathing was too quick (<2 s cycle), 11 that their breathing was too slow (>4 s), 9 that inhalation was too long, 18 occasionally did not 'get the jump on the Gs,' and 34 frequently or occasionally talked during +Gz exposures. Of the 105 reported deficiencies, 67 (64%) were mostly or completely corrected: 30/33 (91%) if the timing of breathing was too quick, 8/11 (73%) if too slow, 5/9 (56%) if inhalation too long, 12/18 (67%) 'jump on the Gs,' and 12/34 (35%) if they talked. This program was most successful in remediating timing problems with the AGSM.</abstract>"
1997,United States,"Female United States Air Force (USAF) pilots: Themes, challenges, and possible solutions","<title>Female United States Air Force (USAF) pilots: Themes, challenges, and possible solutions</title> <abstract>Background: Identification of stresses of mixed-gender squadrons, attention to the psychological concerns of pilots in combat, and recognition of the difficulties of balancing a career and family are important in today's United States Air Force (USAF). What qualities are desirable in male and female pilots in combat situations, how do men and women view their career and family goals, and how do men and women work together in day-to-day squadron activities versus deployment and combat situations? Methods: A semi- structured clinical interview sought information about personal/family health, squadron relationships, and career/deployment stresses. The interview covered the effect of grounding for more than 30 d, motivation to fly, health decrements due to aircraft design, teamwork difficulties and blocks to success, career demands, combat and prisoner of war (POW) concerns, stress and coping styles, flying goals, and family/health concerns. There were 114 (64 male and 50 female) pilots who participated in the study. Results: The majority of male pilots interviewed asserted that they would be more protective of a woman in combat than a man and were concerned about their reaction to a female POW. Many women were concerned about being used to exploit men in a POW camp. The majority of pilots believed women were well integrated into their squadrons. Those interviewed reported that the squadron members with the most difficulty dealing with women were older males, including enlisted crew and some commanders. Conclusion: The information gained from this study will assist the USAF in understanding and coping with the psychological stresses associated with combat, deployment, and mixed- gender squadrons.</abstract>"

The legal obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are discussed and debated by a management attorney and a senior attorney adviser with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The attorneys agree that the pilot is disabled but question whether or not he is deemed a qualified person with a disability. Guidelines for determining the side effects of a prescribed drug and an employee's ability to perform his or her job are considered. The legal experts advise that the pilot be medically examined by a specialist and that the employer must determine the applicability of employee drug testing.</abstract>
1997,,Employer has duty to propose other job opportunities.,"<title>Employer has duty to propose other job opportunities.</title> <abstract>A California appeals court reversed a ruling against an airline pilot who was grounded after he was diagnosed with AIDS, and upheld a ruling against a second pilot with AIDS. The decision involved United Airlines pilots, R. Chris Prilliman and the late Paul Rafalowski. Neither pilot informed the airline that they were HIV-positive. When United Airlines conducted its routine medical certifications in 1994, both pilots were discovered to have AIDS and were immediately grounded. Neither were offered any alternative forms of employment and neither requested it. Both filed with private insurers and with Social Security for disability benefits. Rafalowski deteriorated quickly and died in March 1996. Prilliman remained in fairly good health and his motor and intellectual skills remained within normal range. The lawsuits said that United Airlines violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). Only the FEHA claim reached the Court of Appeal. The court found that because Rafalowski was incapable of working an eight-hour day, he could not be accommodated with another job. However, Prilliman should have had an opportunity for employment with United. The Court also denied United's argument that Prilliman was judicially estopped from suing for a return to work because he had filed for disability benefits.</abstract>"

Three goals were pursued in this study: (a) to study individual and group responses to the stress factors specific to the simulation; (b) to make a critical comparison of a variety of tools and methods used for this purpose; and (c) to express recommendations for future research. Direct methods (questionnaires, tests) and indirect methods (observation) were used in an individual and a whole group assessment. The group did not show important stress manifestations during the isolation period. It maintained its cohesion by opposing the external authority. Some tools were more efficient than others: The qualitative and indirect methods have revealed much more information than the quantitative or direct methods that reinforced one's defense to avoid criticism.</abstract>"

A brief analysis of the abilities measured by the SLT is presented, and investigations involving Royal Netherlands Air Force aviator applicants and Royal Netherlands Navy air traffic control applicants are reported. Task performance of samples from both populations (N = 175 and N = 87, respectively) correlated significantly with subsequent pass-fail in training (r = .34). Incremental validity of the SLT is demonstrated by (a) the absence of significant correlations with other operational selection tests and (b) a multiple regression analysis showing that the SLT explained a significant amount of residual variance not explained by the existing operational tests. We conclude that the SLT increases the assessment potential of an existing selection battery. However, we recommend simplifying the scoring procedure and suggest ways to increase the validity.</abstract>"

""Apollo 13 Creativity"" is a cultural and creative problem-solving appreciation of the thinking style that made the Apollo mission succeed: creativity under severe limitations. Although creativity is often considered a ""luxury good,"" of concern mainly for personal enrichment, the arts, and performance improvement, in life-or-death situations it is the critical pathway not only to success but to survival. In this case, the original plan for a moon landing had to be transformed within a matter of hours into a return to earth. By precluding failure as an option at the outset, both space and ground crews were forced to adopt a new perspective on their resources and options to solve for a successful landing. This now-classic problem provides a range of principles for creative practice and motivation applicable in any situation. The extreme situation makes these points dramatically.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Team Play with a Powerful and Independent Agent: Operational Experiences and Automation Surprises on the Airbus A-320,"<title>Team Play with a Powerful and Independent Agent: Operational Experiences and Automation Surprises on the Airbus A-320</title> <abstract>Research and operational experience have shown that one of the major problems with pilot-automation interaction is a lack of mode awareness (i.e., the current and future status and behavior of the automation). As a result, pilots sometimes experience so-called automation surprises when the automation takes an unexpected action or fails to behave as anticipated. A lack of mode awareness and automation surprises can be viewed as symptoms of a mismatch between human and machine properties and capabilities. Changes in automation design can therefore be expected to affect the likelihood and nature of problems encountered by pilots. Previous studies have focused exclusively on early generation ""glass cockpit"" aircraft that were designed based on a similar automation philosophy. To find out whether similar difficulties with maintaining mode awareness are encountered on more advanced aircraft, a corpus of automation surprises was gathered from pilots of the Airbus A-320, an aircraft characterized by high levels of autonomy, authority, and complexity. To understand the underlying reasons for reported breakdowns in human-automation coordination, we also asked pilots about their monitoring strategies and their experiences with and attitude toward the unique design of flight controls on this aircraft.</abstract>"
1997,New Zealand,The interaction of culture with general job stressors in air traffic controllers,"<title>The interaction of culture with general job stressors in air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>Elements of the job of Air Traffic Controllers perceived as being stressful were rated for degree of stressfulness by a group of Singaporean controllers. The results were compared with those from earlier studies in Canada and New Zealand. It was hypothesized that the international nature of the job would be reflected in findings from all three groups of controllers. It was further hypothesized, however, that environmental and cultural factors would produce differences among the groups and that these would be greater between the Asian and the two ""Western"" cultures than between the two earlier samples studied. Results showed that the two Western cultures share 56% common variance in their perceptions of stressfulness, but this changes to 35% between the New Zealand and Singapore groups and only 21% between Canada and Singapore. Although comparison of the factor structure of the stress ratings of the Singapore and New Zealand samples again confirmed a general pattern of underlying stressors related to air traffic control (which fits general occupational models of stress), it also revealed culturally specific components. The nature of these suggests that they are embedded in the context of Asian environments and cultures. The conclusion is that stress in Air Traffic Controllers is related both to generic occupation stressors and to others that are both organizationally and culturally specific.</abstract>"

Causal model parameters were estimated separately for each sample and, due to the small sample size for women, no between-groups statistical tests were conducted. The results are viewed as tentative because of the small sample of female students; however, the path coefficient parameter estimates are still useful. The model showed a direct influence of general cognitive ability (g) on the acquisition of job knowledge and an indirect influence on the acquisition of flying skills. The direct and indirect influence of cognitive ability on flying skills was a little stronger for women than for men. Additionally, the path between prior job knowledge (JK<inf>p</inf>) and flying performance was somewhat stronger for women than for men. Consistent with previous findings, the influence of early flying skills on later flying skills was very strong. No argument for a sex-separated training syllabus is supported.</abstract>"

1997,Germany,Aircrew fatigue in long-haul operations,"<title>Aircrew fatigue in long-haul operations</title> <abstract>The studies were conducted on the transmeridian routes Düsseldorf (DUS)-Atlanta (ATL) and Hamburg (HAM)-Los Angeles (LAX), and on the north-south route Frankfurt (FRA)-Mahe (SEZ). Scheduled flight duration was between 8:50 hours (ATL-DUS) and 11:50 hours (HAM-LAX). In total, 25 rotations (50 flights) have been investigated by pre-, in- and post-flight data collection of sleep, taskload, fatigue and stress by electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram measurements and subjective ratings. Inflight ratings of taskload showed low perceived exertion during the Atlantic nights, and were moderate during the north-south transitions. Fatigue ratings increased with progressing flight duration. Towards the end of long U.S.-westcoast flights performed at day-time, and in all night flights, fatigue was elevated compared to the 'baseline' ratings collected during the day-time DUS-ATL flights. Fatigue was rated as being 'critical' by several pilots, particularly during the return flight SEZ-FRA when fatigue was severely pronounced. From the findings it is concluded that duty schedules, as performed on the route HAM-LAX (because of long duty hours), and particularly on the route FRA-SEZ (because of consecutive night work), may place excessive demands on mental and physiological capacity. With respect to legal aspects, the results are significant and should promote further deliberations for advanced schemes of flight duty time limitations and rest requirements. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Deviance among expeditioners: defining the off-nominal act through space and polar field analogs.,"<title>Deviance among expeditioners: defining the off-nominal act through space and polar field analogs.</title> <abstract>The space venture resembles other extreme environmental exploration in many respects. Since the beginning of the space program, social and behavioral scientists have predicted that space crews increasingly will begin to experience the kinds of deviant behaviors seen in other extreme environmental duty settings as mission duration, crew size, and heterogeneity increases. However, there has been a long history of neglect by the nation's space agency of those psychosocial human factors which will play such a vital role in future manned spaceflight. The author argues that this is counterproductive, even dangerous, and that social and behavioral studies must be conducted to generate baseline data regarding dysfunctional acts in extreme environments, including the milieu of the space mission. An obstacle to studying occurrences and frequencies of deviant acts is the absence of a standardized definition of such acts in the extreme environment. Borrowing the sanitized NASA term ""off-nominal"", which generally refers to a maladaptive action, a preliminary reliability test was conducted among five scientists who work with human interaction in extreme environments. They were asked to rate situations from several actual space and polar expeditions for numbers of off-nominal acts. They were told the object of the exercise was to derive a standardized definition and were not provided with any specific definition of off-nominality. Substantial agreement in their ratings provided reliable information to construct a working definition of off-nominality. Various interactions and behaviors which respondents deemed off-nominal could be subsumed under poor expertise, mental disorder, forms of abuse and interpersonal insensitivity, problems of authority and responsibility, task deficits, poor hygiene and fitness, poor field-base communication, and human error with equipment from violating safety procedures and poor judgment as to its usage.</abstract>"

The goal is to reduce errors through team work. Human factors research and social, cognitive, and organizational psychology are used to develop programs tailored for individual airlines. Flight crews study accident case histories, group dynamics, and human error. Simulators provide pilots with the opportunity to solve complex flight problems. CRM in the simulator is called line-oriented flight training (LOFT). In automated cockpits CRM promotes the idea of automation as a crew member. Cultural aspects of aviation include professional, business, and national culture. The aviation CRM model has been adapted for training surgeons and operating room staff in human factors.</abstract>"

Using the 'big five' personality structure (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to new experiences, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), female United States Air Force pilots were compared with both male Air Force pilots and to a female comparison group. Female Air Force pilots were higher on the Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness scales than male pilots. Female pilots were also higher on these scales than the female comparison group and lower on the Neuroticism and Openness scales than that comparison group. It is suggested that these traits are highly adaptive for Air Force pilots, given the nature of modem military operational requirements.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Psychiatric syndromes associated with problems in aeronautical adaptation among military student pilots,"<title>Psychiatric syndromes associated with problems in aeronautical adaptation among military student pilots</title> <abstract>Background: We identified syndromes based upon prominent psychiatric symptom patterns exhibited by military student pilots with problems in aeronautical adaptation, and evaluated their relationship to subject variables and eventual completion of flight training. Method: Two aeromedical psychologists retrospectively reviewed consecutive student pilot referrals to the mental health clinic at the U.S. Army Aviation Training Center at Fort Rucker, AL. Data on completion of flight training was later obtained. Results: We identified 99 cases manifesting symptomatology associated with difficulty establishing aeronautical adaptation. Prominent syndromes (and prevalence) were: Anxiety (26%); Marital Conflict (22%); Somatization (15%); Depression (13%); Phobic Reactions (12%); and Misconduct (11%). Phobic reactions presented earlier in training, whereas marital conflicts were more prominent later in training. All phobic students were eliminated from training; 45% of all others completed training. Completion was significantly more likely for students with Anxiety and Marital Conflicts that manifested after primary flight training. Conclusions: The identification of discrete syndromes with differing outcomes highlights the need for early identification and classification of student pilots with psychiatric symptoms reflecting difficulty in aeronautical adaptation.</abstract>"
1996,United Kingdom,Skill maintenance in extended spaceflight: A human factors analysis of space and analogue work environments,"<title>Skill maintenance in extended spaceflight: A human factors analysis of space and analogue work environments</title> <abstract>This paper discusses the implications of increasing mission lengths of manned spaceflight for the design of future space systems from a human factors point of view. It is argued that the increase in mission duration has brought about a number of new problems, which have not been sufficiently addressed in space research. Therefore, a review of analogue work environments is carried out to make up for the paucity of space research found in the area of human performance in long-duration spaceflight. This resulted in an evaluation of seven analogue environments concerning their similarity to space with industrial process control and nuclear submarines coming out as the closest match on the technical dimension. Finally, some recommendations are given from the lessons learnt in spaceflight, simulation studies and appropriate analogue environments. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Human performance during exposure to toluene,"<title>Human performance during exposure to toluene</title> <abstract>Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of inhalation of toluene on respiratory function and neuropsychological performance of humans. Methods: We exposed six healthy adults to 100 ppm toluene or air (control) for 6 h, in a double-blind, randomized fashion, with exposures separated by at least 14 d and including 30 min of exercise at a level that quadrupled minute ventilation. Blood and exhaled air toluene levels were measured before, during, immediately, and 1 and 2 h post- exposure. Lung function was measured before and immediately alter exposure. Three repetitions of two computerized neuropsychological tests were performed, including a brief standard neuropsychological battery (ANAM) and a 1-h complex performance test (SYNWORK). Statistical analysis of the psychological data was conducted as a repeated measures ANOVA. Findings: Following exercise, the mean blood and exhaled air toluene levels averaged 1.5 μg and 28 ppm, respectively. Lung function was unchanged post-exposure. On the SYNWORK test, the Composite score obtained over time during toluene exposure was rower than that during room air (F = 29.20, p = 0.005), with the score from the final hour reduced by 10%. On standard neuropsychological tests, latency but not accuracy proved the sensitive measure for five of the seven subtests presented. Conclusions: Performance of complex tests and response time to simple brief tests can be disrupted by toluene inhalation at 100 ppm. Differences in performance between air and toluene conditions were greatest after exercise, indicating that physical activity may enhance the response to volatile organic solvents.</abstract>"
1996,,The loneliness of the long-duration astronaut.,"<title>The loneliness of the long-duration astronaut.</title> <abstract>This paper investigates the psychological implications of long duration spaceflight. Initial psychological problems associated with a heavy workload were identified during Skylab missions. Since then, most of our knowledge of psychological problems has come from experience onboard Russian spacecraft. Noted problems include anxiety, boredom, crew interactions, problems associated with isolation and confinement, and others. Efforts to alleviate or prevent these problems are discussed, as well as comparisons to similar environments such as arctic regions or submarines. As the U.S. participates in longer space missions, it will be wise to study psychological issues and to learn from our Russian counterparts.</abstract>"
1996,Italy,Is there a hypercoagulable state in military fighter pilots?,"<title>Is there a hypercoagulable state in military fighter pilots?</title> <abstract>Background: A hypercoagulable state is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, the most important cause of permanent grounding of flying personnel. Hypothesis: The aim of our study was to investigate whether a hypercoagulable state is present in jet pilots, and whether it can be due to flight activity. Method: To this purpose we studied Fibrinopeptide A (FPA), Thrombin Antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D-Dimer (DD), sensitive biochemical markers of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis activation, in 10 jet pilots after a standardized training flight mission, and in a control group. Also evaluated before flight were 6 jet pilots. Results: We were able to show increased thrombin and plasmin activity both in jet pilots compared to the control group, and after flight in the 6 pilots who were evaluated twice. Conclusion: We conclude that a hypercoagulable state due to flight activity is present in jet pilots after flight. Possible mechanisms involve an effect of psycho physical stress mediated by a neuroendocrine response to flight activity, or an effect of chronic: +Gz exposure on cardiovascular structure and function.</abstract>"
1996,Japan,Trace element and hormonal responses during flight aptitude test,"<title>Trace element and hormonal responses during flight aptitude test</title> <abstract>Background: The purpose of this study was to determine how trace metal and hormone levels change during stressful flight tests. The relationship between the hormonal response and flying performance was also investigated. Methods: Urinary zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), noradrenaline (NAd), adrenaline (Adr), and saliva cortisol (Cs) levels were determined in 67 pilot applicants and compared with NAd, Adr, and Cs levels in 30 instructor pilots during 4 flight tests. Results: Applicants had significantly decreased Zn concentrations following flight, but Cu concentrations remained unchanged. NAd, Adr, and Cs concentrations significantly increased following flight; the average ratio (post-/pre-flight) of the hormonal levels of the applicants was 1.52 (NAd), 3.57 (Adr), and 2.80 (Cs) compared with 1.86 (Adr) in instructors (NAd and Cs concentrations were not significantly changed in instructors following flight). Multiple regression analyses of post-flight levels of Zn for the hormonal levels revealed that Zn levels correlated significantly (p < 0.05) negatively with Adr levels. Hormonal responses for the best-rated and worst- rated applicant groups were greater than in the other groups, and post- flight levels of NAd and Adr in the best-rated group tended to return more rapidly to pre-flight levels. Conclusion: Flight test stress causes pilot applicants to change levels of urinary Zn, NAd, Adr, and Cs. Post-flight Zn decrement was likely related to an increase in Adr, suggesting that circulating Zn is sequestered by the liver in situations that induce hormonal changes.</abstract>"

1996,United States,Three-Dimensional Audio Versus Head-Down Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System Displays,"<title>Three-Dimensional Audio Versus Head-Down Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System Displays</title> <abstract>The advantage of a head-up auditory display for situational awareness was evaluated in an experiment designed to measure and compare the acquisition time for capturing visual targets under two conditions: standard headdown Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) display and three-dimensional (3-D) audio TCAS presentation. (The technology used for 3-D audio presentation allows a stereo headphone user to potentially localize a sound at any externalized position in 3-D auditory space). Ten commercial airline crews were tested under full-mission simulation conditions at the NASA - Ames Crew - Vehicle Systems Research Facility Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator. Scenario software generated targets corresponding to aircraft that activated a 3-D aural advisory (the head-up auditory condition) or a standard, visual - audio TCAS advisory (map display with monaural audio alert). Results showed a significant difference in target acquisition time between the two conditions, favoring the 3-D audio TCAS condition by 500 ms.</abstract>"
1996,France,Co-operation processes in dynamic environment management: Evolution through training experienced pilots in flying a highly automated aircraft,"<title>Co-operation processes in dynamic environment management: Evolution through training experienced pilots in flying a highly automated aircraft</title> <abstract>Dynamic environment management (process control, aircraft piloting, etc.) increasingly implies collective work components. Pragmatic purposes as well as epistemological interests raise important questions on collective activities at work. In particular, linked to the technological evolution in flight management, the role of the 'collective fact' appears as a key point in reliability. Beyond the development of individual competencies, the quality of the 'distributed' crew activity has to be questioned. This paper presents an empirical study about how experienced pilots co-ordinate their information and actions during the last period of training on a highly automated cockpit. A task of disturbance management (engine fire during takeoff) is chosen as amplifying cognitive requirements. Analysis focuses on the transitions between the main task and the incident to be managed. Crew performance and co-operation between two pilots are compared in three occurrences of the same task: the results are coherent with the hypothesis of a parallel evolution of the crew performance and its internal co-operation, and show that prescribed explicit co-operation is more present on action than on information about the 'state of the world'. Methodological issues are discussed about the possible effects of the specific situation of training, and about the psychological meaning of the results.</abstract>"
1996,Norway,Psychological Measures As Predictors of Pilot Performance: A Meta-Analysis,"<title>Psychological Measures As Predictors of Pilot Performance: A Meta-Analysis</title> <abstract>The purposes of this study were to review the validity evidence for psychological measures used in pilot selection and to detect possible moderators for the relationship between predictors and pilot performance. A total of 66 independent samples from 50 studies were located and included in the meta-analysis. The best predictors of pilot performance were previous training experience (.30) and combined indexes, a combination of several cognitive and/or psychomotor tests (.37). The next best predictors were tests measuring cognitive (.24) and psychomotor/information-processing abilities (.24), as well as aviation information (.24) and biographical inventories (.23). The personality, intelligence, and academic tests yielded lowest mean validities (.14, .16, and .15, respectively). The analysis indicated that moderators might be operating for all test categories except academics, and the effect of several moderators were examined.</abstract>"

Importance ratings were collected from military aircrews (i.e., two-member teams) from three distinct types of aircraft. Results indicated that when assessing team behavior importance, less experienced team members weighted difficulty of performing team behaviors more heavily, whereas more experienced team members weighted time spent performing team behaviors more heavily. Implications for analyzing team performance, with respect to the process of conducting such analyses and the type of information collected, are discussed.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Analyzing components of work samples to evaluate performance,"<title>Analyzing components of work samples to evaluate performance</title> <abstract>A method is described in which work sample data were analyzed to reveal how aircraft maintenance technicians differed in troubleshooting performance after a training intervention. During the training phase of the study, approximately half the technicians received troubleshooting instruction from an intelligent tutoring system, and the remaining technicians received informal on-the-job training. Data from work samples, in which technicians verbally isolated simulated equipment failures, were collected from both groups before and after the training. The work sample data were then examined by subject matter experts who scored performance for overall proficiency and noted specific violations of good troubleshooting practice. These violations provided the basis for the components of performance examined in the work sample data. The results of this componential analysis allow more specific conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the training intervention by revealing how the tutoring system improved technicians' troubleshooting (e.g., tutored technicians were more likely than untutored technicians to test components thoroughly to ensure they were faulty before replacing them).</abstract>"
1996,United States,Central role of g in military pilot selection,"<title>Central role of g in military pilot selection</title> <abstract>The role of general cognitive ability (g) in the selection of military pilots is discussed. Four seminal issues that threaten the interpretation of the results of ability studies are introduced and examined. A brief history of the use of g in pilot selection is presented, going back to the World War I era. At that time, many countries used tests such as perception and reaction time, later shown to be mostly measures of g. The World War II era brought the age of the multiple aptitude batteries, and with it, the theory of differential abilities. However, most militaries still used highly g-saturated measures. More recently, an awareness of the prominence of g in job performance has led to a series of studies that showed the central role of g in predicting pilot success. In comparative analyses, g was found to be a better predictor of pilot criteria than specific abilities. However, some specific abilities or measures of job knowledge were found to increment the predictiveness of g. Several selection variables that appeared to measure characteristics other than g were found to measure, at least in some part, g. These include psychomotor tests and structured interviews. Finally, speculation on the future of the measurement of g is presented.</abstract>"
1996,Ireland,Psychological testing and pilot licensing,"<title>Psychological testing and pilot licensing</title> <abstract>This article reviews contemporary trends in the psychological testing of pilots. It is written in the particular context of draft European Joint Aviation Authorities licensing proposals which, in certain circumstances, envisage psychological testing for pilot licensing purposes. The article aims to clarify issues relating to the validity, reliability, and value of pilot psychological testing in this particular context. It is first suggested that the entire domain is characterized by terminological and methodological confusion. The economic and other benefits of psychological testing are contrasted with the potential risks, including abuse and the use of tests in circumstances for which they were never designed. Reference also is made to cultural differences that potentially may impact on the practical realities of psychological testing - especially within the European context, where the debate is presently at its most intense.</abstract>"
1996,Germany,On the relation between personality and job performance of airline pilots,"<title>On the relation between personality and job performance of airline pilots</title> <abstract>The validity of a personality questionnaire for the prediction of job success of airline pilots is compared to validities of a simulator checkflight and of flying experience data. During selection, 274 pilots applying for employment with a European charter airline were examined with a multidimensional personality questionnaire (Temperament Structure Scales; TSS). Additionally, the applicants were graded in a simulator checkflight. On the basis of training records, the pilots were classified as performing either at standard or below standard after about 3 years of employment in the hiring company. In a multiple-regression model, this dichotomous criterion for job success can be predicted with 73.8% accuracy through the simulator checkflight and flying experience prior to employment. By adding the personality questionnaire to the regression equation, the number of correct classifications increases to 79.3%. On average, successful pilots score substantially higher on interpersonal scales and lower on emotional scales of the TSS.</abstract>"
1996,Germany,Medical and ground crew support during Euromir 95.,"<title>Medical and ground crew support during Euromir 95.</title> <abstract>The longest manned mission previously supported by ESA was Euromir 94, which lasted just 30 days. The quantum leap to the originally planned 135 days of the Euromir 95 mission meant that a number of concepts needed to be rethought and adapted. One of the more obvious consequences was that the astronaut would be separated for a much longer period from his home environment, which meant that some of the ground-related support also had to be re-evaluated. Additional support associated with the 'psychological climate' onboard the station as a result of the longer mission duration was also necessary. Post-flight analysis has shown that all support elements functioned satisfactorily, but a number of potential improvements have also been identified.</abstract>"

In Experiment 1, a part-task group showed positive transfer but did not perform as well as a whole-task group. Backward-transfer analysis indicated that only a subset of the component tasks was critical to the criterion task. In Experiment 2, a part-task training regime that used the critical component tasks was compared with a whole-task regime and a part-task regime composed of noncritical component tasks. Results indicated that the critical part-task regime was as effective as the whole-task regime, validating the utility of the backward-transfer technique.</abstract>"
1995,United States,Cognitive and Noncognitive Determinants and Consequences of Complex Skill Acquisition,"<title>Cognitive and Noncognitive Determinants and Consequences of Complex Skill Acquisition</title> <abstract>Integration of multiple perspectives on the determinants of individual differences in skill acquisition is provided by examination of a wide array of predictors: ability (spatial, verbal, mathematical, and perceptual speed), personality (neuroticism, extroversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness), vocational interests (realistic and investigative), self-estimates of ability, self-concept, motivational skills, and task-specific self-efficacy. Ninety-three trainees were studied over the course of 15 hr (across 2 weeks) of skill acquisition practice on a complex, air traffic controller simulation task (Terminal Radar Approach Controller; TRACON; Wesson International; Austin, TX). Across task practice, measures of self-efficacy, and negative and positive motivational thought occurrence were collected to examine prediction of later performance and communality with pretask measures. Results demonstrate independent and interactive influences of ability tests and self-report measures in predicting training task performance. Implications for the selection process are discussed in terms of communalities observed in the predictor space. © 1995 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
1995,Canada,Spatial orientation in aviation: Visual contributions,"<title>Spatial orientation in aviation: Visual contributions</title> <abstract>Misjudgement of spatial orientation is reported to be an important factor in a substantial proportion of aviation accidents. The likelihood of such misjudgement is particularly high when there are conflicting interactions between labyrinthine and visual signals. In a manoeuvering aircraft, visual information is often a crucial factor in the pilot's ability to judge the aircraft's altitude and position with respect to external and terrain features. A body of research evidence supports the following conceptual framework. (1) The human visual system processes a limited number of visual dimensions almost independently of each other (for example, colour, luminance, spatial frequency, orientation, changing size, motion in depth, time to contact). (2) Each of these selective sensitivities shows considerable intersubject variability. (3) Intersubject variability is far from perfectly correlated across the set of selective sensitivities. This paper discusses the relevance of this framework for predicting, first the specific situations in which visual judgments are most likely to occur and, second, which individual pilots are most likely to make the visual misjudgements. © 1995 Elsevier Science Inc.</abstract>"
1995,United States,Functions of External Cues in Prospective Memory,"<title>Functions of External Cues in Prospective Memory</title> <abstract>A simulation of an air traffic control task was the setting for an investigation of the functions of external cues in prospective memory. External cues can support the triggering of an action or memory for the content of the action. We focused on memory for the content, and manipulated the temporal characteristics of the external cue to disentangle two possible functions the cue can support: (1) an external cue visible during a retention interval could support rehearsal of the to-be-performed action; (2) an external cue visible at the end of a retention interval could support retrieval of the to-be-performed action. Two experiments were conducted that converge on the same conclusion: the primary function of an external cue is to support retrieval. Implications for the design of a computer interface to present prospective cues are discussed. © 1995, IEEE. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

In addition, it examines differences in profile between self‐selected applicants for flying training and the general population; the effects of test‐taking conditions on scale scores; incidental selection effects related to personality differences and the reliability of the personality data. The EPI and 16PF inventories were administered to samples of men during selection testing at the RAF Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre, Biggin Hill. Further samples were tested at the Army Air Corps Centre at Middle Wallop prior to their Selection Board interviews. In addition, data were obtained for non‐enlisted applicants tested at Biggin Hill and amateur aviators tested at various flying clubs. The results confirmed previous findings that applicants for pilot training are highly ‘self‐selected’, being much more emotionally stable and more extraverted than the general population. Furthermore, the 16PF profile for the unselected sample was found to be very similar to that for US airline pilots. The pattern of differences between those who succeeded and those who failed in training was as expected. The magnitude of these correlations (in the region of r = .20) was also at the level expected. The results support the findings of previous work and indicate that there are small but potentially valuable increments in validity to be obtained by considering personality factors in selection for pilot training. The problems associated with the use of self‐report measures in selection are discussed. 1995 The British Psychological Society</abstract>"

The study took into consideration 572 male air traffic controllers, aged between 23 and 59 years, of whom 301 were engaged in three large Regional Centres, 189 in thirteen Airport Towers and 82. formerly active controllers, were working in administrative offices. The former controllers showed worse health levels, in particular minor psychological disorders and chronic fatigue. Sixteen of them had been transferred to administrative jobs because of health impairment, owing to severe diseases of the nervous, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. Such disorders, and musculoskeletal ones, were mostly reported by the active controllers. The controllers engaged in Regional Centres showed more sleep disturbances than those engaged in towers. Beside age, some personal characteristics appeared to influence health and well-being. Neuroticism was correlated with chronic fatigue, digestive and cardiovascular complaints, minor psychological disorders, cognitive and somatic anxiety. On the other hand, morningness was correlated negatively with sleep disturbances on morning shift, and positively with sleep duration both on morning shift and rest days. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1995,United States,Effects of Jet Engine Noise and Performance Feedback on Perceived Workload in a Monitoring Task,"<title>Effects of Jet Engine Noise and Performance Feedback on Perceived Workload in a Monitoring Task</title> <abstract>This study examined the effects of exposure to intermittent jet aircraft noise (70 dBA or 95 dBA maximum intensity) and knowledge of results concerning signal detections (hit-KR) on performance efficiency and perceived workload in a 40-min visual vigilance task. The noise featured a Dopplerlike quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d‘) was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a “floor effect” rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload. The results provide the initial experimental demonstration that perceived workload is a sensitive measure of the effects of aircraft noise in monitoring tasks. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1995,United States,Going Beyond Heart Rate: Autonomic Space and Cardiovascular Assessment of Mental Workload,"<title>Going Beyond Heart Rate: Autonomic Space and Cardiovascular Assessment of Mental Workload</title> <abstract>Psychophysiological assessment of pilot mental workload using heart rate should be augmented with an autonomic space model of cardiovascular function. This model proposes that autonomic nervous system influences on the heart may change with psychological processing in ways that are not evident in heart rate. A method of mental-workload assessment was proposed that used multiple psychophysiological measures of cardiovascular responsivity to derive the underlying sympathetic and parasympathetic information needed to represent the autonomic space for heart rate. Principal-components analysis was used to extract Sympathetic and Parasympathetic components from heart period, residual heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and Traube-HeringMayer wave in three experiments that manipulated perceptual/central processing and physical task demands. This initial evaluation of the method concluded that the autonomic components were valid and that the components had greater diagnosticity, and for some manipulations greater sensitivity, than heart rate. These results support the contention that the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic components provided increased precision for mental-workload assessment. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Cramped conditions, isolation from family and loved ones, work stress, fear, and incompatibility with fellow crew, are but a few of the problems suffered by astronauts and cosmonauts during their long missions in orbit about the earth. Although criteria for selection of crew is one aspect of attacking the problem, it has not solved it Notwithstanding good selection, team combination, and counselling before flight, problems have still occurred with unwanted consequences. Incompatibility of team members, far from being the exception, has been frequent. This has been detrímental both physiologically and psychologically for the individual as well as for the operational success and safety of the missions. Because problems will inevitably occur in future long duration missions, especially when they are of international and multi-cultural nature, the importance of dealing with them is underlined. This paper takes a different approach towards ameliorating these problems, namely that of psychological group training before a mission. © 1996.</abstract>"

This space lab training mission lasted seven days and was the first to be conducted with astronauts outside of Russia. The objective of this mission was to give Canadian astronauts, space scientists and the staff of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the opportunity to gain first hand experience on preparational and operational aspects of a typical space mission. Twenty-one scientific experiments involving six countries from several disciplines were involved in this mission. This paper describes the goals and preliminary results of a psychological experiment/training program that used the CAPSULS mission as a test bed for its application in the manned space flight environment. The objective of this project was to enhance the understanding of small group behaviour with a view to maximizing team effectiveness and task accomplishment in teams living and working in isolation under difficult and confined conditions. The application of this model in the light of future missions is a key thesis in this paper. © 1996.</abstract>"
1995,,The impact of culture on human and space development-New millennial challenge,"<title>The impact of culture on human and space development-New millennial challenge</title> <abstract>The Space Age is causing new applications to the concept of culture, a human coping tool. The exploration and exploitation of outer space resources are altering human culture both on Earth and in orbit. For the first time in history, our species need not merely react and adapt to environment, but plan for a space culture appropriate for extraterrestrial migration. The impact of culture can be analyzed in terms of how space developments alter human perceptions and behavior on this planet; the emergence of a new culture to suit the orbital environment; the organizations that build spacecraft and deploy people aloft; and the technological systems created for spacefaring. This article presents a paradigm for analyzing some of the non-technical human factors involved in space undertakings. It also offers a method for classifying a culture according to ten categories which may be applied both to a macroculture, such as a lunar base; or a microculture, such as a space agency or crew. Human enterprise in space is viewed as both altering the species, and providing a challenge for expanded behavioral and biological scientific research on living and working in space. © 1996.</abstract>"

Nevertheless, very few studies have been performed on this fundamental issue and none of them has addressed it in its entirity, considering its diverse physical and psychological aspects. In this work, a descriptive model is proposed to expound the mechanism and sequence of events which mediate stress. A critical analysis of the information provided by past manned spaceflights and by dedicated research performed in analogous environments is presented, and an extrapolation of the available data on human stress in such extreme conditions is proposed. Both internal and external stressors have been identified, at physical and psychosocial levels, thus providing the basis for their early detection and preventive reduction. The possible negative consequences of stress that may lead to disease in crewmembers are described. Finally, the most effective instruments which may be of help in reducing space-related human stress and treating its negative consequences are suggested. © 1996.</abstract>"
1995,Japan,Eye scanning behavior as a discriminator of instrument- and scenery-centered flight task.,"<title>Eye scanning behavior as a discriminator of instrument- and scenery-centered flight task.</title> <abstract>Aircraft pilot's eye scanning behavior represented by saccadic amplitudes and dwelling time of eye movements is a promising indicator of discrimination whether some flight task is instrument- or scenery-centered. The saccadic amplitude seems to reflect spatial and temporal values of target information. The dwelling time or gaze duration reflects the changing rate of visual information, amounts extracted from and density and complexity of the target information, or experience level of a relevant pilot. This study is for confirming the validity of the above indicator to discriminate the two types of flight tasks, instrument- and scenery-centered tasks. Five jet aircraft pilots, aged 25 to 32, participated in this experiment. A flight simulator equipped with a computer generated visual scene (field of view: 116 degree (H) x 25 degree (V)) was used. Five kinds of flight tasks were selected. These were takeoff, level flight, low-airspeed flight, acrobatic flight (minimum timed turn), and landing. These tasks were selected with the difference in degree of instrument- or scenery-centered flight, by the pilots' comments. Eye movements during simulator flight were recorded by a conventional electrooculographic apparatus with an 12-channel polygraph system. Analogue data from the amplifiers was digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz, and stored in a computer system. Horizontal components of eye movements by flight task were analyzed. Mean saccadic amplitudes (microV) showed significant differences among flight tasks, and no significance between subjects was obtained. The largest mean amplitude was in the acrobatic flight, and the smallest was in the low-airspeed flight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract>"
1995,France - Germany,Blood volume regulating hormones response during two space related simulation protocols: Four-week confinement and head-down bed-rest,"<title>Blood volume regulating hormones response during two space related simulation protocols: Four-week confinement and head-down bed-rest</title> <abstract>The volume of regulating hormones (renin, aldosterone, arginine vasopressin and atrial natriuretic factor), electrolytes and creatinine concentrations, and blood pressure were measured in two different four-week experimental protocols: respectively -6 ° head-down bed-rest (5 subjects) and confinement (6 subjects). We observed a significant increase (P < 0.01 at D2 vs D-5) of systolic blood pressure during confinement and a different level of response for some hormones, especially for arginine vasopressin (300% increase during confinement instead of 50% during bed-rest). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was enhanced during confinement and head-down bed-rest. In both conditions, we obtained a similar pattern of response for blood volume regulating hormones. During confinement, two main factors were inactivity and stress activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In the bed-rest study the response is principally due to the fluid shift and blood volume adaptation but it is not possible to exclude the role of inactivity and stress. © 1995.</abstract>"

1995,United States,Defining and measuring the 'right stuff': Neuropsychiatrically enhanced flight screening (N-EFS),"<title>Defining and measuring the 'right stuff': Neuropsychiatrically enhanced flight screening (N-EFS)</title> <abstract>Background: United States Air Force (USAF) commanders wish to make better pilot-selection and cockpit-assignment decisions. Also, some pilots will sustain head injuries that will affect their flying careers. The complex and unforgiving nature of aviation demands a conservative approach to occupational return after neurological insult. Therefore, a neuropsychological assessment is required to return to flying. The lack of pre-injury neuropsychological data, however, hinders accurate assessment of post-injury functioning. Hypotheses: a) Psychological data may improve the pilot selection and assignment processes as military resources dwindle; and b) baseline intellectual/cognitive data may support the scientific basis of aeromedical decision-making. Methods: Neuropsychiatrically Enhanced Flight Screening (N-EFS) attempts to validate the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB), CogScreen, Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PI-R), and Personal Characteristics Inventory (PCI) for pilot selection and cockpit assignment. N-EFS also measures baseline intelligence (using the MAB) and cognitive functioning (using the CogScreen) for comparison purposes if a future medical flying waiver is needed after neurological insult. These assessments will compare the aviator's postinjury functioning to a personal intellectual functioning baseline captured at entry into aviation training. Results: N-EFS students are scoring from below average to very superior in intellectual assessment. Very preliminary personality testing results suggest few significant differences between male and female student pilots, with high extraversion being the most striking personality characteristic. Discussion: The wide range of intellectual functioning in pilot candidates argues for baseline data collection to improve future aeromedical decisions.</abstract>"
1995,United Kingdom,Post-traumatic stress disorder in airplane cabin crew attendants,"<title>Post-traumatic stress disorder in airplane cabin crew attendants</title> <abstract>Six cabin crew attendants who survived an airplane crash in which 47 passengers were killed were assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological problems. Each was interviewed 8 months after the crash and completed questionnaires measuring intrusive thoughts, avoidance, depressed mood, anxiety, and fear. Questionnaires were repeated 10 months later. All six met DSM-III-R criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, reported a wide range of symptoms, and developed a fear of flying 8 months after the crash. Depression scores were normal 18 months after the crash, but all other measures remained unchanged, showing a continued high level of traumatic stress. Results point to the potential for crash survivors to develop chronic psychological problems. The highest levels of distress were reported by the three most senior members of staff with the most responsibility on board, who had also suffered the most severe physical injury. Clinical implications of the results are discussed, and the need for predisaster training of cabin crew and postdisaster treatment is emphasized.</abstract>"
1995,Finland,Neuroendocrine responses to real and simulated BA Hawk MK 51 flight,"<title>Neuroendocrine responses to real and simulated BA Hawk MK 51 flight</title> <abstract>The effects of psychological workload on the plasma levels of eight neuroendocrine hormones were studied in 5 undergraduate and 5 senior military pilots of the Finnish Air Force (FAF). All subjects performed the same short- term basic flight mission, which included the following: 1) start; 2) ILS- approach in minimum weather conditions; 3) visual approach; and 4) landing. The mission was performed twice: first with the BA Hawk MK 51 simulator with minimal G-forces and after that with a BA Hawk MK 51 let trainer with Gx- forces below +2. Blood samples were collected 30 min before and 10 min after the mission and were measured for adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, β- endorphin, prolactin, vasopressin (AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and cortisol. The plasma levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, β- endorphin, and cortisol did not change significantly in response to simulated or real flight. Plasma prolactin levels increased significantly (p = 0.037) in all subjects after the mission performed with jet trainer, and the increase was especially great in cadets. However, the same mission performed with the simulator did not raise plasma prolactin levels. This finding suggests that the psychological workload in a flight simulator does not correspond to the psychological workload in a real jet trainer, at least not in basic flying. Plasma AVP increased significantly (p = 0.032) after the mission performed with the simulator in cadets; this increase can be described as a 'first-time effect.' Plasma ANP also increased significantly (p < 0.05) after a real jet trainer flight. ANP generally maintains the electrolyte and water balance, but it is possible that elevated plasma ANP levels during a military flight are due to an increased workload of the heart and sympathetic stimuli. Because the psychological workload of the flight missions was not extreme, basic military flying had no effect off the usual stress hormones such as ACTH, β-endorphin, and cortisol in this study. Certain hormones, especially prolactin, and to a lesser degree ANP and AVP, appear to be sensitive to psychological workload.</abstract>"
1995,,Aviators at risk,"<title>Aviators at risk</title> <abstract>Human error has been found to cause or contribute to most aviation accidents. Excess emotional stress may have an adverse effect on pilot performance and is known to increase the risk of an aircraft mishap. Family problems, social stressors, career instability, worry, aircraft accidents, and difficult flight schedules are a few of the many potential sources of emotional stress in aviation. Pilots who fail at stress coping may become depressed or even self-destructive. They may externalize their feelings, act out, or blame others for their misfortunes. The aviator at risk may demonstrate 'warning signs' such as defensiveness, arrogance, hostility, financial irresponsibility, excesses in routine habits, fatigue, deteriorating pilot performance, or increased risk taking. The aeromedical practitioner's role is to educate aircrew members and help them understand stress and its effect on pilot performance. The time may come when an aviator is confronted by multiple stressors, and inadequate stress coping or failure on the part of the aviation community to recognize the 'warning signs' may have disastrous results.</abstract>"
1995,Israel,The psycho-physiological response to parachuting among novice and experienced parachutists,"<title>The psycho-physiological response to parachuting among novice and experienced parachutists</title> <abstract>Elevated heart rate and increased anxiety are two indicators of stress. This study investigated the heart rate and anxiety response to parachuting among seven novice and six experienced parachutists. Heart rate was measured from the moment of boarding the aircraft until landing. Anxiety was measured prior to boarding the aircraft. Heart rate was significantly higher among the novice compared to the experienced parachutists, especially during takeoff (125 ± 11 vs. 95 ± 17 beats · min-1, respectively), and upon exit or free fall (184 ± 12 vs. 164 ± 17 boats · min-1, respectively). However, due to the difference in ages between the groups, when expressed relative to maximal heart rate, there was no difference in the heart rote response between groups (e.g., exit/free fall: 93.0 ± 5.5% vs. 88.4 ± 7.8% for novice and experienced, respectively). No statistical differences were observed in the anxiety scores between groups, although the novice parachutists scored somewhat higher (16.0 ± 3.7 vs. 12.5 ± 5.7, respectively). A significant correlation (r = 0.72) was observed between heart rate upon landing and the state anxiety scores. These results demonstrate a high psychophysiological stress response to parachuting among both novice and experienced parachutists. It is likely that novice parachutists are stressed to a higher degree and may therefore be mare prone to performance-related injury (e.g., upon landing). However, since both groups reached a similar percentage of their maximal heart rate, they may be at a similar risk of cardiac injury.</abstract>"
1995,United States,A psychophysiological evaluation of the perceived urgency of auditory warning signals,"<title>A psychophysiological evaluation of the perceived urgency of auditory warning signals</title> <abstract>One significant concern that pilots have about cockpit auditory warnings is that the signals presently used lack a sense of priority. The relationship between auditory warning sound parameters and perceived urgency is, therefore, an important topic of enquiry in aviation psychology. The present investigation examined the relationship among subjective assessments of urgency, reaction time, and brainwave activity with three auditory warning signals. Subjects performed a tracking task involving automated and manual conditions, and were presented with auditory warnings having various levels of perceived and situational urgency. Subjective assessments revealed that subjects were able to rank warnings on an urgency scale, but rankings were altered after warnings were mapped to a situational urgency scale. Reaction times differed between automated and manual tracking task conditions, and physiological data showed attentional differences in response to perceived and situational warning urgency levels. This study shows that the use of physiological measures sensitive to attention and arousal, in conjunction with behavioural and subjective measures, may lead to the design of auditory warnings that produce a sense of urgency in an operator that matches the urgency of the situation. © 1995 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

1994,New Zealand - United Kingdom,Individual differences in mental imagery experience: Developmental changes and specialization,"<title>Individual differences in mental imagery experience: Developmental changes and specialization</title> <abstract>This research has two purposes: (1) to study developmental changes and differences in visual and movement imagery in male and female children and adults; (2) to investigate whether systematic differences in imagery vividness can be measured in specialist groups. In Study 1, the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire and the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire were administered to 547 individuals in age groups from 7–8 to 50 + years of age. Significant increases in imagery vividness were found in females at 8–9 and in males at 10–11 years. In general females report more vivid imagery than males but at about 50 females' movement imagery reduced in vividness. In Studies 2–5 imagery differences in specialist groups were examined using the same two questionnaires with a total of 655 participants. In Study 2, children aged 7–15 years with poor movement control were found to be extremely poor imagers with 42 per cent reporting no imagery at all. In Study 3, physical education students reported more vivid imagery than students specializing in physics, English, and surveying. In Study 4, significant differences were found between elite athletes' imagery and that of matched controls. In Study 5, air traffic controllers and pilots were found to have significantly more vivid imagery than matched control groups. Introspective reports of imagery experience show a systematic pattern of relationships with age, gender, and specialization requiring high‐level performance of perceptual motor skills. These findings support the theory that mental imagery plays a key role in the planning and implementation of action. 1994 The British Psychological Society</abstract>"
1994,United States,Attempting to Conceal Psychological Disturbance: MMPI Defensive Response Sets and the Rorschach,"<title>Attempting to Conceal Psychological Disturbance: MMPI Defensive Response Sets and the Rorschach</title> <abstract>This study examined whether a defensive response set during a psychological evaluation would skew responses on the Rorschach such that subjects could conceal psychological difficulties. Subjects in this study were commercial airline pilots who were required to undergo an independent psychological evaluation after completing a treatment program for alcohol or substance abuse. Subjects knew the results of the psychological evaluation would be taken into account by the Federal Aviation Administration and their employer when deciding whether to reinstate their pilots’ license, and allowing them to return to work. Thus, subjects potentially had considerable incentive to attempt to create a favorable impression. As expected, subjects responded in a defensive manner, as assessed by standard Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. (MMPI) validity scales. It was expected that a guarded, defensive response set would be manifested on the Rorschach by fewer than average responses, a constricted response style, and an attempt to appear conventional. It was also expected that no or few signs of difficulty would be produced on the Rorschach if subjects were successful in their efforts to create a favorable impression. In spite of defensive efforts to create a favorable impression, these subjects produced valid Rorschach protocols that suggested they experienced emotional distress, self-critical ideation, and difficulties in their interpersonal relationships, problems not reported on the MMPI. Implications of these findings for clinical practice, future research, and relationships between the MMPI and Rorschach are discussed. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1994,Ireland,Constructing safety,"<title>Constructing safety</title> <abstract>The human factor is responsible for the majority of aviation accidents, both in the air and on the ground. Established systems to protect safety, such as checking procedures, have an inescapable statistical probability of failure. They also provide the psychological conditions for learning unsafe behaviour. A failure to follow standard operating procedures is the most prevalent characteristic of accidents associated with both aircrew and ground handling accidents. Strategies to improve the safety of human performance on the airport apron include ergonomic design of the interfaces between the operative and the work environment; matching the operative more effectively to the task and providing organisational support for safe operation. Reviewing the application of these strategies to the universal problem of road accidents reveals mixed findings. Highway engineers have paid varying degrees of attention to the ergonomic development of the road environment. From a psychological viewpoint they have tacitly been using methods for modifying driver behaviour. Recognition of this should enable a more systematic development of the approach. Current driver selection and training methods are dramatic failures: those who have most recently passed the driving test kill the most pedestrians and are most likely to be killed themselves. Best practice at the organisational level is conspicuous by its absence. It is suggested that a constructive new direction for road safety interventions would be the development of a sense of ownership of safety and safety programmes at the level of the community. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper summarises the main outcome of this research, in the context of the so-called 'Pharmemsi Study'. The first part is dedicated to the content of the medical kits used by astronauts in flight, while the second describes how weightlessness can modify the action of drugs (i.e. pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics parameters) on the human body.

1994,France,Psychomotor performance during a 28 day head-down tilt with and without lower body negative pressure,"<title>Psychomotor performance during a 28 day head-down tilt with and without lower body negative pressure</title> <abstract>Several factors may affect psychomotor performance in space: sensory-motor changes, sleep disturbances, psychological modifications induced by the social isolation and confinement. However, psychomotor performance is difficult to assess. A battery of standardized and computerized tests, so-called ""Automated Portable Test System"" (APTS) was devised to ascertain the cognitive, perceptive and motor abilities and their possible fluctuations according to environmental effects. Antiorthostatic bedrest, often used to simulate weightlessness, (particularly cardiovascular modifications) also constitutes a situation of social confinement and isolation. During two bedrest experiments (with head-down tilt of -6°) of 28 days each, we intended to assess psychomotor performance of 6 males so as to determine whether: &#x02022; -on the one hand, it could be altered by remaining in decubitus; &#x02022; -on the other, the Lower Body Negative Pressure sessions, designed to prevent orthostatic intolerance back on Earth, could improve the performance. To accomplish this, part of the APTS tests as well as an automated perceptive attention test were performed. No downgrading of psychomotor performance was observed. On the contrary, the tasks were more accurately performed over time. In order to assess the experimental conditions on the acquisition phase, the learning curves were modelled. A beneficial effect of the LBNP sessions on simple tests involving the visual-motor coordination and attention faculties can only be regarded as a mere trend. Methods used in this experiment are also discussed. © 1994.</abstract>"
1994,United States,"The effect of an in-flight, emergency training program on crew confidence","<title>The effect of an in-flight, emergency training program on crew confidence</title> <abstract>Abstract. Introduction: Despite some progress, the air medical transport profession continues to experience widely publicized accidents that result in injuries and death to crew members and patients. An air medical crew member's experience, training and confidence may affect his or her ability to deal effectively with an in-flight emergency, and may also affect his or her behavior before and after the emergency. Setting: A hospital-based, rural rotor- and fixed-wing program flying approximately 890 flights per year. Seventy-seven percent of these flights are interfacility. Methods: A pretraining survey evaluated the experiences of air medical crew members and pilots. A 20-question assessment tool based on a 5-point Likert scale evaluated how confident the individuals were in their ability to react to in-flight emergencies. An extensive in-flight emergency training program was then conducted. Personnel were asked to complete the same questionnaire one month and six months after the training. Results: On the pretraining questionnaire, flight crew members with neither prior training nor actual experience in in-flight emergencies showed the lowest level of confidence. Those with prior training, actual in-flight emergency experience or both, responded with higher levels of confidence. The mean confidence scores of the study participants increased from 82 pretraining to 89 at one month post-training and remained at the increased level six months after training. Conclusions: A training program focusing on in-flight, aircraft-related emergencies can increase the crew's confidence during such situations. This increase in confidence is most noticeable in those without previous training or experience and is maintained for at least six months. Several other benefits occur from the training program. © 1994.</abstract>"
1994,Switzerland,Workload and psychophysiological stress reactions in air traffic controllers,"<title>Workload and psychophysiological stress reactions in air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>Interactions between workload and psychophysiological stress symptoms were investigated in a population of 205 predominantly male air traffic controllers (ATCs) from the area control centre (ACC) and the airport control tower (TWR) in Zurich and Geneva. Each subject completed two questioning sessions and two working sessions, the first time during a period of low traffic and the second time during a period of high traffic. For the questioning sessions standardized questionnaires were used. For all investigated working sessions, different aspects of the subjective and objective workload were recorded. Before and after each session, a saliva sample for assessing the concentration of secreted cortisol was taken. The questionnaire parameters represented psychological stress symptoms, such as complaints of physical discomfort, depression, negative self-communication, work-increased anxiety, coping behaviour and subjective rating, and interpretation of various aspects of the working situation. The mean values measured were within the normal range, and only a few significant differences between the two questioning sessions were found. However, about 10 to 15% of the ATCs showed elevated values in psychological stress symptoms to an extent indicating that they might have serious stress problems at work and/or in their private life. The investigated working sessions showed that the ATCs’ subjective ratings correspond clearly to their cortisol response and the objective workload. Thus, ATCs’ complaints regarding excess work stress should be taken seriously. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Ltd.</abstract>"
1994,France,Synthesis of ethological studies on behavioural adaptation of the astronaut to space flight conditions,"<title>Synthesis of ethological studies on behavioural adaptation of the astronaut to space flight conditions</title> <abstract>The motor behaviour of the astronaut as revealed in his movement, posture and orientation is treated as observable evidence of the subject's adaptation to space flight conditions. In addition to the conservative physiological homeostasies, the quantitative description of the astronaut's motor activity in microgravity is postulated in terms of an innovative regulation, within a temporal dynamic. The proposed ethological method consists of first drawing up a specific behavioural repertoire and then of using video recordings of space missions to describe each of the behavioural units observed in the ongoing flux context in which it occurred. Finally the data is quantified into frequencies of occurrence, transition and association and completed with factorial correlation analysis. Comparison of ground training (g = 1) and space flight (g = 0) between the first and last day of a mission up to return to Earth gravity simulated by an anti-orthostatic decubitus experiment, reveals the nature of the adaptive strategies implemented. These strategies are evidence of changes in the behavioural repertoire including the search for predominantly visual environmental cues and the progression of motor skill during the flight. The pre-flight period is defined as a phase involving automizing of motor patterns and the post-flight period as rehabituation of strategies which have already been acquired. The phenomena observed are discussed in terms of the new spatial representation and the body image, constructed by the astronaut during his adaptation. They are considered to be optimizing for the subject's relation to his environment. © 1994.</abstract>"

This study had three major goals: First, these data allowed for an evaluation of the effects of the new norms for the traditional validity and clinical scale scores of the MMPI-2 in an employment selection program. Second, the effects that test defensiveness had on the MMPI-2 scores of a group of individuals, airline pilot applicants who were taking the test in a preemploy-ment context, were evaluated. Third, useful descriptive information was provided on the performance of airline pilot applicants on MMPI-2 scales to give interpretive guidelines for using the MMPI-2 in psychological screening. A sample of 437 airline pilot applicants seeking employment as airline flight crew members was administered the MMPI-2. Results of the study showed that the MMPI-2 norms were more appropriate for characterizing pilot applicants than were the original MMPI norms, which tended to overpathologize test takers. The effects of defensiveness on MMPI-2 profiles were found to be pronounced. Interpretive guidelines for using the MMPI-2 in personnel screening were proposed. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1994,Italy - Romania,Burnout and health status in Italian air traffic controllers,"<title>Burnout and health status in Italian air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>This study investigated burnout in air traffic controllers (ATC's). There were 109 Italian ATC's who filled out the Rome Burnout Inventory, a new tool for burnout assessment, during breaks in the working environment. The questionnaire assessed: 1) emotional-mental exhaustion (EME); 2) physical exhaustion (PE); 3) social support by components of the social network; 4) work- and nonwork-related stressors; 5) self-reported psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. Our data show that the burnout syndrome is closely and positively related to age, years spent in air traffic control, professional dissatisfaction, and to work stressors, but not to nonwork stressors. In our sample, burnout was negatively correlated with social support provided by friends and family. The PE construct seemed to be unreliable in detecting physical burnout in Italian ATC's. Using analysis of variance, subjects with self-reported psychosomatic disorders did not show higher levels of EME scores. Further, EME was positively correlated with self-perceived psychological distress (anxiety, depression and impulse discontrol), but not with physician-rated psychopathology, as revealed by psychoactive drug intake. We suggest that burnout is a construct independent from clinical anxiety or depression.</abstract>"
1994,Bulgaria,Cardiovascular changes at work: Relation with some individual risk factors,"<title>Cardiovascular changes at work: Relation with some individual risk factors</title> <abstract>Heart rate (HR) acceleration during work which is accepted as a main cardiovascular response to stress could be influenced not only by the work itself but also by some behavioural variables. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of several individual characteristics (age, body mass index, arterial blood pressure, Vo2max, leisure time physical activity, Type A behavior and neuroticism) on HR reactivity during work and rest. Sixty-nine male subjects practising several occupations (air traffic controllers, railway station controllers, managers, chemical operators, etc.) participated in the study. The common characteristic of all jobs was the presence of neuro-emotional strain of various degrees. The ECG Holter Medilog 4500 system was used for monitoring the HR during the working day. The HR at work was applied as a single dependent variable in the multiple regression analysis and the independent contribution of the following variables was evaluated: HR at rest, neuroticism and Type A behaviour pattern. They appeared to be the most significant determinants in this model and explained about 23% of the variation in HR during work. As second-rank predictors, age and leisure time physical activity led to a non-essential increase (up to 25%) of the multiple regression coefficient. In order to reduce the risk effects of health-related behaviours and individual patterns on the cardiovascular system it is recommended that a preventive approach based on behavioural modification should be adopted. © Freund Publishing House Ltd.</abstract>"

Fighter pilots were divided into superior, above average, and average with flying ratings of >7, 6-7, and <6, respectively, and with flying experience of 2050 ± 1081 h, 884 ± 575 h, and 616 ± 756 h, respectively. CA excretion data showed significant intra- and intergroup differences. Excretion rates for CA and NE before and after flight were significantly higher in flight cadets than in fighter pilots. After flight, all the preflight urinary variables increased significantly in passed flight cadets, while changes in failed flight cadets were not significant. In all groups of fighter pilots, preflight excretion rates for CA, E, and NE rose postflight, but the differences within the groups were not significant. The NE/E ratio decreased significantly as a function of flight adaptation. The pre- and postflight NE/E ratios were lower in fighter pilots than in flight cadets. The ΔNE/E ratio decreased in fighter pilots, but increased in flight cadets. The preflight NE/E ratio was smaller for superior than for above average and average fighter pilots, and for passed than for failed flight cadets. The postflight NE/E ratio did not show any significant differences within the groups. In superior fighter pilots, the ΔNE/E ratio remained relatively stable, while it was reduced in above average and average fighter pilots. An unchanged or a reduced ΔNE/E ratio can be regarded as rapid adaptation of sympathoadrenal activity to flying stress. In passed flight cadets, ΔNE/E ratio rose, indicating a flight-induced sympathoadrenal stimulation. This can be interpreted as a prerequisite for flight adaptation during initial phase of flight training. On the contrary, failed flight cadets exhibited a higher preflight NE/E ratio which showed a postflight reduction. This can occur because of overstimulation and reduced responsiveness of sympathoadrenal activity before and during flight, respectively. These changes may represent a neuroendocrine response which might represent a failure to adapt.</abstract>"
1994,United States,Tools for assessing situational awareness in an operational fighter environment,"<title>Tools for assessing situational awareness in an operational fighter environment</title> <abstract>Three Situational Awareness Rating Scales (SARS) were developed to measure pilot performance in an operational fighter environment. These instruments rated situational awareness (SA) from three perspectives: supervisors, peers, and self-report. SARS data were gathered from 205 mission-ready USAF F-15C pilots from 8 operational squadrons. Reliabilities of the SARS were quite high, as measured by their internal consistency (0.95 to 0.99) and inter- rater agreement (0.88 to 0.97). Correlations between the supervisory and peer SARS were strongly positive (0.89 to 0.92), while correlations with the self- report SARS were positive, but smaller (0.45 to 0.57). A composite SA score was developed from the supervisory and peer SARS using a principal components analysis. The resulting score was found to be highly related to previous flight experience and current flight qualification. A prediction equation derived from available background and experience factors accounted for 73% of its variance. Implications for use of the composite SA score as a criterion measure are discussed.</abstract>"
1994,United States,Personality factors affecting pilot combat performance: A preliminary investigation,<title>Personality factors affecting pilot combat performance: A preliminary investigation</title> <abstract>Reviews of the research literature have generally concluded that personality factors contribute little to pilot performance. One possible explanation for the failure to find stronger relationships may be due to the lack of appropriate taxonomies for both personality constructs and for performance constructs. The present research was designed to examine the relationship between personality and combat performance using the 'Big Five' model of personality and a multi-component model of pilot combat performance. A sample of 100 USAF pilots rated the importance of 60 traits for effective performance on performance dimensions such as flying skills and crew management. The results indicated that pilots from different aircraft agreed that the personality trait of Conscientiousness was the most important determinant of performance on all performance dimensions. Implications for pilot selection are discussed.</abstract>
1994,United States,Personality types of flight crew members in a hospital-based helicopter program,"<title>Personality types of flight crew members in a hospital-based helicopter program</title> <abstract>Purpose: To determine the personality preferences of flight crew members in a hospital-based helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and to differentiate and compare these preferences between crew specialties and a historical control population. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted of all active crew members (nurses, respiratory therapists and pilots) in a hospital-based flight program. Data collected included the results of the MBTI, gender, age and years of flight experience. Results: Crew members were represented by 14 of 16 possible MBTI personality types, with three types predominating. For each crew specialty, extroversion preferences predominated over introversion, and perceiving characteristics predominated over judging characteristics. Differences existed by crew specialty for the sensing-intuition and thinking-feeling dimensions. Conclusions: A personality typology has been established for individual and group preferences within one hospital-based HEMS program. This data begins to develop a data base and an investigative protocol for understanding some of the human factors regarding flight programs. Future research should focus on expanding the data base and exploring specific crew interactions based on additional diagnostic and evaluative methodologies. © 1994 Jems Communications.</abstract>"

In AMB cases, the pilot is in a high state of psychological and physiological arousal and tends to focus on one problem, while ignoring more critical information. The following study, conducted under the auspices of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ames Research Center, examined the effect of training in physiological self-recognition and regulation, as a means of improving crew cockpit performance.

1993,Japan,The effect of space flight on human cellular immunity.,"<title>The effect of space flight on human cellular immunity.</title> <abstract>T-lymphocyte responsiveness to mitogens is depressed by an average of 56% in humans (129 subjects) tested during and after space flight. Although there is not yet conclusive evidence of a clinical significance of the test, it is clear that factors of space flight like stress, closed environment and cosmic radiation may affect immune responsiveness. The data obtained from space crews may be compared to the depression seen in subjects undergoing heavy physical stress of head down tilt bedrest. Recently, delayed hypersensitivity [correction of hypersensivity] response was tested on crews of the US space shuttle and of the orbital station MIR by means of a commercially available ""skin test"". Again, the response was lower in 14 of the 15 subjects tested. In two cases, a strong in flight depression could be related to heavy physical and psychological stress experienced in flight. The data available today are not sufficient to draw conclusions on the hazard of infectious diseases during and after space flight. Although the changes observed never harmed the health of astronauts, immunological changes must be seriously investigated and understood in view of long-duration flights on space stations in an Earth orbit and to other planets like Mars and the Moon.</abstract>"

Purpose: This study was devised to identify family member's information needs regarding air medical transport. Methods: Using a descriptive correlational design, 100 family members of air medical patients completed a 14-item Likert-format questionnaire. Each item addressed an information need and asked how important the information was to the family member and how much of this information they received. Results: The information needs most frequently ranked as very important related to the patient's condition, the patient's admitting unit at the receiving hospital, and being able to see the patient prior to flight. Information most frequently received by the family related to the patient's condition. Conclusion: Flight crews need to be cognizant of families' needs and develop ways to improve communication with the family to meet those needs. © 1993 Jems Communications.</abstract>"
1993,Italy,Evaluation of workload in air traffic controllers,"<title>Evaluation of workload in air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>This study examined 20 air traffic controllers from the Rome Regional Air Control Centre for three successive work shifts: afternoon (13: 00-20: (0), morning (07 : 00–13 :(0) and night (20: 00––07 : (0). The number of aircraft under control per hour was recorded as index of workload. Recordings involved subjective ratings (mood, physical fitness, fatigue) and objective measures (hean rate, vanilJyl mandelic acid excretion, reaction times, critical flicker fusion, oral temperature). In addition, the subjects fined out questionnaires for personality traits (extroversion, neuroticis, anxiety) and behavioural characteristics (momingness, rigidity of sleeping habits, vigourness to overcome drowsiness). The volume of air traffic varied greatly with peaks during the day and low levels at night. Nevertheless, the heart rates of the group members showed quite constant levels in all the three shifts, irrespective of the workload. The same pattern appeared in the controllers' excretion of VMA, which remained high during both day and night shifts, regardless of the reduced workload. The subjective mood and physical fitness decreased similarly, while feelings of fatigue increased on all three shifts, particularly on the night shift. The circadian rhythm of the oral temperature showed a slight modification of the noctural depression during the night shift, caused by the state of awakeness and activity. However, the rhythm was not altered in its normal circadian phase, due to the fast shift rotation adopted. The psychophysiological responses were affected by personal characteristics, in particular momingness and ability to overcome drowsiness. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd.</abstract>"

However, some sleep disturbances have been reported which influence performance of the crew and safety of space flight. This paper reviews the main studies of in-flight sleep in animal and man. Most disturbances are related to phase lags due to operational requirements. Factors which can disturb in-flight sleep are analysed: &#x02022; • environmental factors. Some of them are secondary to space flight ergonomics. Conversely, effects of microgravity on light-dark alternance are less known and lead to interesting problems of fundamental research, &#x02022; • psychological factors, especially during long duration flights. © 1993.</abstract>"
1993,United States,Short-Term Effects of Occupational Stressors on Daily Mood and Health Complaints,"<title>Short-Term Effects of Occupational Stressors on Daily Mood and Health Complaints</title> <abstract>This article related daily changes in 2 job conditions, workload and social interaction with co-workers and supervisors, to daily mood and health complaints. Fifty-two air traffic controllers (ATCs) completed measures of subjective well-being and perceived job conditions on 3 consecutive days; objective indicators of daily workload (air traffic volume and visibility at the airport) were also obtained. The results indicate that increases in job stressors are associated with a same-day deterioration in physical and psychological well-being. On days in which workload was perceived to be high, ATCs reported more health complaints and moods that were more negative and less positive. On days in which there was greater air traffic volume (objectively measured), ATCs reported moods that were more negative. On days in which interactions with co-workers and supervisors were described as more distressing, ATCs reported moods that were more negative and less positive.</abstract>"

1993,Pakistan - Sweden,"Mission challenge, mental workload and performance in military aviation","<title>Mission challenge, mental workload and performance in military aviation</title> <abstract>In modern military aircraft, complexity of information combined with time stress creates difficulties for the pilot under combat conditions. The first step to mitigate this problem is to measure mental workload. Several methods for doing so have been proposed. In this paper we develop an analysis of mental workload as distinguished from its prior flight mission parameters (risk, challenge) and subsequent effects (mission performance). A model is developed on the basis of extensive mission data, both ground attack and fighter missions, which exhibits a dual coping process as a response to challenge and risk: emotion coping, leading to tension and decreased performance, and problem solving, leading to increased mental energy and improved performance. The model implies a selection of optimal measures for constructing an index of mental workload which is demonstrated to yield a sensitive measure of the pilot's changing mental status over the course of a period of training.</abstract>"
1993,United States,Alcoholism and treatment in airline aviators: One company's results,"<title>Alcoholism and treatment in airline aviators: One company's results</title> <abstract>Airline transport pilots are at risk for alcoholism, although prevalence statistics are not known. (Alcoholism is used to mean alcohol dependence as defined in DSM-III- R.) Whether their prevalence of alcoholism is consistent with that of the general population's, less, or possibly enhanced by psychological vulnerabilities, is considered. However, the development and implementation of this job-based, peer-oriented alcohol treatment can be an asset to pilot career progression and airline pilot retention. According to a retrospective analysis of identified aviators, 87% of alcoholic pilots of this major airline returned to flight duties after substance abuse treatment. Relapse occurred in 13% of those accepting treatment. Early identification and treatment of the substance-abusing aviator can be enhanced by encouraging teamwork between pilots, union, airline management, flight surgeons, and employee assistance program professionals.</abstract>"
1993,Italy,Influence of stress on lymphocyte subset distribution - A flow cytometric study in young student pilots,"<title>Influence of stress on lymphocyte subset distribution - A flow cytometric study in young student pilots</title> <abstract>Stressors can induce sizable modifications on immunocompetent cells. Major circulating lymphocyte subsets were quantitated in Italian Air Force student pilots undergoing intensive training and continuous evaluation, a stressful situation both physically and psychologically. Instructor pilots matched for age and assayed in parallel were used as controls. A typical flight training session was not able per se to induce immediate significant modifications of the lymphocyte subset distribution either in the students or instructors, although it did affect plasma levels of stress-related hormones such as growth hormone, prolactin and cortisol in the former. Irrespective of the time of flying, however, the percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes and the CD4/CD8 ratio were lower in students than in instructors and the absolute number of CD8+ lymphocytes was higher in students than in instructors. In a second series of experiments, 30 student pilots were tested at the beginning and at the end of a flight course (duration 30 days). Although the percentage of CD29+ lymphocytes comprised in the CD8+ subset was reduced at the end of the course in all individuals, such a reduction was more evident in those students who failed to pass the final examination, an additional cause of psychological stress. In light of the functional significance of the lymphocyte subsets investigated, it is suggested that the present stress-induced alterations may have practical implications.</abstract>"

A survey was mailed to all USAF operational flight surgeons in the continental U.S. to describe the frequency and distribution of ARMA usage and attitudes. Descriptive statistics suggest that the ARMA is used suboptimally in accordance with current USAF regulation. ARMA training, flight surgeon satisfaction and lack of regulation clarity are described and discussed. More flight surgeons are dissatisfied with the ARMA than are satisfied, and the regulation is perceived as unclear in the area of final disposition for candidates with equivocal ARMA's. A post-hoc analysis to rule out the influences of rank, gender, experience and residency training was performed. Residency training in Aerospace Medicine is beneficial in terms of doing an ARMA, when required, and covering recommended areas. Females and those with less than 1 year experience perform an ARMA more frequently than males and experienced flight surgeons. Despite the limitations of the current ARMA, it should not be abandoned. Recommendations to improve it are provided. Doing better ARMA's can lead to decreased illness, injury, accidents, and attrition.</abstract>"

The mean age of the 40 female subjects was 30·0 (SD=6·9) years. Measurements of oral temperature, alertness, and visual search were performed at two hour intervals two days before the flight from Helsinki to Los Angeles, during the second and the fourth day in the USA and during the second and fourth day after the return flight to Finland. The body temperature desynchronized and the phases of the alertness and visual search rhythms shifted rapidly in the USA. After the return flight, the acrophases of the circadian rhythms delayed during the second and fourth day in Finland. During the fourth day the acrophase of alertness was 35 min and the acrophases of body temperature and visual search were 2 h 2 min and 3 h 8 min delayed, respectively. The mathematical model based on the C-, S- and W-process theory of alertness explained 25–96% of the variation of observed mean alertness of the subjects in different conditions. It is concluded that the duration of the de- and resynchronization process of the flight attendants’ circadian rhythms is on the average longer than 9 days during and after round flights over ten time zones. The mean alertness of the subject can be predicted with considerable accuracy using the mathematical model. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd.</abstract>"

1992,Australia,Flying Apart: Separation Distress in Female Flight Attendants,"<title>Flying Apart: Separation Distress in Female Flight Attendants</title> <abstract>This study investigated the effects of relatively short separations from partners on the distress of female flight attendants during overseas tours of duty. In the study, the distress of separated attendants was compared with the distress of two other subsamples of otherwise demographically equivalent attendants who were either unattached or travelled with their partners. Changes in distress were compared across time phases, which for the experimental sample represented partner accessibility, anticipatory separation, separation, and reunion. The effects on distress of personality, attachment (assessed in terms of remembered aspects of parental care and protection), and marital adjustment were examined. Results provided reasonably strong evidence for the existence of separation distress, which was not related with other variables assessed. The results are discussed in relation to findings from other investigations about separation, anticipatory separation, and reunion distress in adults. 1992 Australian Psychological Society</abstract>"

They chose referents for sentences referring to a protagonist or minor character mentioned 1 sentence (recent character) or 3 sentences (distant character) before this target sentence. All groups chose referents less accurately for sentences about distant and minor characters than about recent and protagonist characters, perhaps because these referents were less likely to be in working memory. Young readers and pilots were more accurate for distant and minor character target sentences in aviation narratives, and recalled aviation narratives more accurately. Expertise did not reduce age differences. Expertise differences may reflect decreased demands on working memory capacity, and age declines may reflect reduced capacity.</abstract>"

The inflight data are compared with baseline data measurements of the subjective horizontal body position (SHP) at normogravity (1g) and at 2g. Pertinent theoretical alternatives to modelling subjective static orientation are developed and compared to the data. It turns out that a good fit to the baseline results and a satisfactory prediction of the perceived orientation in microgravity can be obtained if the otolithic output is assumed to be normalized, but that of the somatic gravity sensors is not. © 1992.</abstract>"

Therefore, the term 'morale' is related to anxiety and depression. The purpose of this survey is to assess stress levels numerically by using anxiety and depression scores. We surveyed 345 active duty Turkish Air Force pilots and 70 non-flying Air Force officers (who served as control group) in 1988. Spielberger's State Trait Personality Inventory (STPI-A Trait) and Zung's Depression Scale (ZDS) were applied to both groups. The flier group reflected lower scores than the non-fliers. Different explanations are available, but we believe the most likely to be related to higher motivation and job satisfaction as well as ego strengths of fliers. These factors can increase the ability to cope with stressful conditions.</abstract>"

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-III-R) uses the term obsessive-compulsive to describe two conditions. A review of terminology is undertaken to present the reader with the distinguishing features of the personality disorder versus the anxiety disorder. The anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, is incompatible with safe performance of aviation duties. Obsessive-compulsive personality, on the other hand, describes a point on a continuum where useful, adaptive compulsive traits may become abnormally exaggerated and maladaptive, thus interfering with the aviator's normal routine, occupational functioning, relationships with others, and aviation safety.</abstract>"

Interest has been shown in the possibility of adding a brief ''mini-mental exam,'' or a simple automated test-battery to the standard flight medical to screen for such conditions. The research reported here involved the empirical evaluation of two ''mini-mental exams,'' two paper-and-pencil test batteries, and a prototype version of an automated screening battery. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated for each sub-task in a discriminant study of 54 pilots and 62 individuals from a heterogeneous clinical population. Results suggest that the ''mini-mental exams'' are poor candidates for a screening test. The automated battery showed the best discrimination performance, in part because of the incorporation of dual-task tests of divided attention performance. These tests appear to be particularly sensitive to otherwise difficult-to-detect cognitive impairments of a mild or subtle nature. The use of an automated battery of tests as a screening instrument does appear to be feasible in principle, but the practical success of a screening program is heavily dependent upon the actual prevalence of cognitive impairment in the medical applicant population.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Personality types among experienced military pilots,"<title>Personality types among experienced military pilots</title> <abstract>Three distinct personality subtypes were empirically identified in a sample of 170 experienced U.S. Army pilots, using a new measure of personality developed for use in occupational settings. The subtypes are similar to those previously derived in a sample of military aviation trainees. No significant differences across the clusters were found for the types of missions flown, years of aviation or military service, or number of flight hours. A significantly greater number of instructor pilots was found among a cluster which comprised the smallest percentage of pilots in the sample. Overall, the results support the notion that no one type of personality is a prerequisite for success in military aeronautics, and highlight the need for additional studies of personality type in military and commercial aviation, using more sophisticated measures of aeronautical adaptability.</abstract>"

These were associated with ''break-off'' symptoms, which are inflight sensations of separation from the ground, the environment, and the aircraft. Following extensive psychiatric and medical evaluations, one aviator was diagnosed as having agoraphobia without panic disorder, and the other as having an otherwise unspecified anxiety disorder. These patient reports demonstrate the need for the clinical aerospace medicine specialist to investigate inflight anxiety conditions for underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. The reports also contrast some of the historical aeromedical concepts with modern psychiatric diagnostic nomenclature.</abstract>"

1991,United States,Pilot Personality and Crew Coordination: Implications for Training and Selection,"<title>Pilot Personality and Crew Coordination: Implications for Training and Selection</title> <abstract>The performance of pilots can be construed as a product of skill, attitude, and personality factors. Although a great deal of effort within the aviation community has been focused on ensuring technical expertise, and new efforts highlight attitudes associated with crew coordination, personality factors have been relatively unexplored. Further, it is argued that past failures to find linkages between personality and performance were due to a combination of inadequate statistical modeling, premature performance evaluation, and/or the reliance on data gathered in contrived as opposed to realistic situations. The goal of the research presented in this article is to isolate subgroups of pilots along performance-related personality dimensions and to document limits on the impact of crew coordination training between the groups. Two samples of military pilots were surveyed in the context of training in crew coordination. Three different profiles were identified through cluster analysis of personality scales. These clusters replicated across samples and predicted attitude change following training in crew coordination. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1991,Saudi Arabia,Cabin crew stress factors examined.,"<title>Cabin crew stress factors examined.</title> <abstract>The impact of reduced cockpit crew on the cabin crew in commercial airlines is examined. One hundred cabin crew members participated in a study to determine what stressors are present in contemporary transport aircraft, the extent of differences in rating context-related and task-related stressors, and the effect of peak versus normal periods of duty time on stress factors. Results indicate that under peak period conditions, context-related factors are more stressful than task-related factors. Recommendations to alleviate cabin crew stress factors include training to maximize crew knowledge and abilities, elevate cabin crew to the same status as cockpit crew, improve the cabin crew certification program, and expose cabin crew to cockpit crew procedures to foster better communication and enhance safety.</abstract>"
1991,Russian Federation,Psychological aspects of pilot spatial orientation.,"<title>Psychological aspects of pilot spatial orientation.</title> <abstract>Researchers examined the psychological aspects of pilot spatial orientation to aircraft attitude. Study participants completed questionnaires and made drawings of view-from-the-ground and aircraft front window and of attitude indicators, then made flights in a simulator or aircraft with unknown pitch attitude. Analysis of data indicates that pilots favored a view-from-the-ground indicator. The main drawback to the view-from-the-aircraft indicator was mobility of image. The study also examined spatial-orientation techniques pilots use in different flight phases and identified seven factors in effective spatial-orientation techniques. Other components of the study included a comparison of the manipulative capability of pilots and nonprofessional participants and pilot recall of a set of images from long-term and operational memory.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Brief cognitive behavior therapy in an undergraduate pilot student: A case report,"<title>Brief cognitive behavior therapy in an undergraduate pilot student: A case report</title> <abstract>This is a case report of a male undergraduate pilot student referred from the aerospace medicine service because of difficulty coping with stresses associated with undergraduate pilot training (UPT). Two phases of a short-term cognitive-behavioral treatment program were undertaken. The initial phase of treatment involved assisting the student to become aware of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological cues that were associated with increased levels of stress, and relaxation training. The second treatment phase involved stress inoculation strategies and coping procedures that were competency based, rather than mastery based. The latter had previously been unsuccessfully used by the student. Results indicated increases in self-reported stress management skills and in objective reports of training performance. Although generalizability of this study is limited, short-term cognitive behavioral therapy procedures are felt to be an important tool for improving the performance of UPT students, and may also reduce the probability of self-initiated elimination due to subjective stress complaints.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Psychiatric diagnoses in a group of astronaut applicants,"<title>Psychiatric diagnoses in a group of astronaut applicants</title> <abstract>Between 1959 and 1987, the psychiatric evaluation of astronaut candidates evolved from a 30-h intensive examination evaluating applicants for psychopathology, and studying their performance under stress, to a 2-h clinical interview whose structure and contents were determined by the individual examiner. Evaluations done during these years applied both psychiatric (or, ''select-out'') criteria and psychological (or, ''select-in'') criteria. In an attempt to more rigorously define the psychiatric, ''select-out'' component, a standardized, semi-structured clinical interview was developed to identify the presence or history of psychiatric disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Ed. (''DSM-III''). A total of 117 astronaut applicants underwent this clinical interview as part of a comprehensive medical evaluation during a recent astronaut selection. Of the 117 applicants, 9 (7.7%) met DSM-III criteria for a variety of Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, including V-code diagnoses.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease,"<title>Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease</title> <abstract>This study explored associations among job activities and disability due to cardiovascular disease by merging national disability data with independently-obtained job activity data. Disability data were taken from a 1978 U.S. health interview survey (n = 9855). Expert ratings of job activities (dimensions) were obtained from a job analysis database (n = 2485 occupations). The two databases were merged such that job dimension data were imputed to each occupation in the disability database. Odds ratios for cardiovascular disability were calculated for scores in the second, third, and fourth quartiles for each of the 32 job dimensions, using scores in the first quartile as the standard. Job dimensions associated with cardiovascular disability were (a) hazardous situations; (b) vigilant work and responsibility for others; (c) exchanging job-related information; and (d) attention to devices. Occupations identified with high scores on these job dimensions included transportation jobs (air traffic controllers, airline pilots and attendants, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), teachers (preschool, adult education), and craftsmen/foremen (machinists, carpenters, and foremen). © 1991.</abstract>"
1991,Norway,"Relationships between stress, psychological factors, health, and immune levels among military aviators","<title>Relationships between stress, psychological factors, health, and immune levels among military aviators</title> <abstract>The present study investigated the relationship between immunoglobulin levels and work stress and personality factors in a population of healthy air force aviators, and also if such factors were related to health complaints. Sixty-four aviators participated, 31 fighter pilots and 33 from a Hercules C130 squadron. Significant correlations were found between environmental stress factors, perceived health complaints and levels of immunoglobulin and complement components. ‘Psychological defence’ correlated with immunoglobulin levels. In a multiple regression analysis, 31% (p<0.05) of the variance for C3 could be explained by perceived work stress and 15% (p<0.05) of the IgA variance by ‘psychological defence’ and ‘complaints related to immune status'. The results confirm that immunological parameters may be used as psychological stress indicators, but the relationships are complex and can be best understood if individual coping and defence strategies are considered. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1990,United States,A retrospective study of marital discord in pilots: The USAFSAM experience,"<title>A retrospective study of marital discord in pilots: The USAFSAM experience</title> <abstract>This exploratory retrospective multi-case study investigates marital discord in USAF pilots as part of an overall concern with mission safety. Seventeen USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) cases involving marital distress were reviwed, using a standardized format. Duration of martial discord ranged from 1-10 years with an average of 2.25 years. The most frequent problem noted was one of communication, with authoritarian or controlling styles predominating. The second most frequent conflict concerned occupational demands; both pilots and spouses complained about frequent work-related separations. Nine of ten distressed outcomes (i.e., separated or divorced) were initiated by the wife. We speculate that a pilot with an inflexible communication style who is not cognizant of his or her spouse's emotional needs is likely to exacerbate marital problems. The notion that marital distress may adversely affect a pilot's attention, generating performance decrements, underscores the importance of investigating elements of marital harmony in the pilot population. Based on our study and review of the literature, we suggest the USAF employ programs that: a) recognize the spouse's contribution to mission safety; b) increase spouse's awareness of mission requirements; c) enhance couple's communication; and d) improve stress management skills.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Corporate instability is related to airline pilots' stress symptoms,"<title>Corporate instability is related to airline pilots' stress symptoms</title> <abstract>The Symptoms of Stress questionnaire was administered to three random samples of commercial airline pilots. Respondents included 1 group of 212 pilots who were employed by an airline company with a history of corporate instability; and 2 groups, totalling 220 pilots, who were employed by 2 airline carriers with histories of corporate stability. The pilot group employed by the airline with a history of corporate instability reported significantly more stress and depression symptoms and a greater accumulation of symptoms than did the pilot groups employed by the stable airlines. With the advent of airline deregulation and its concomitant changes in the airline industry, including corporate instability, we conclude that the relationship between corporate instability within the aviation environment and the subjective distress reported by pilots suggests the need for further investigation into implications for health and safety.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Generalization of tolerance to motion environments,"<title>Generalization of tolerance to motion environments</title> <abstract>The aim of the present investigation was to determine to what extent training tolerance to one motion stimulus would generalize other motion experiences. Twenty subjects prone to motion sickness were selected and assigned to one of four groups after pretesting in a Dichgans and Brandt drum to determine their susceptibility to visually-induced apparent motion. They were also pretested with a VDT display of an expanding surface, and on a revolving/tilting chair. Subjects were assigned to one of the four groups by matching their mean tolerance to visually-induced motion. Subjects in the first group served as controls and received only cognitive counseling regarding their ability to tolerate motion environments. Subjects in the other group received the same counseling coupled with incremental exposures to the drum, chair, or VDT, respectively. Posttests on each apparatus revealed that the treatments involving the chair and the drum provided specific increases in tolerance to the device used during treatment, and that the treatment involving the chair provided a generalized tolerance to visually-induced motion. These results support the notion that there are both specific and general components in learning to tolerate motion environments.</abstract>"
1990,,Sustained peripheral vasoconstriction while working in continuous intense noise,"<title>Sustained peripheral vasoconstriction while working in continuous intense noise</title> <abstract>Immediate exposure to intense and continuous noise induces a significant increase in vasoconstriction which, while habituating over time, remains reliably higher than in quiet throughout a work period. Those who routinely encounter such noise conditions at work may therefore be vulnerable to the long-term consequences of such changes upon the vascular system. The effects of noise on vasoconstriction lend support to one aspect of the composite model of noise and human behavior, but the role played by noise-masking of acoustic cues in impairing performance remains unclear.</abstract>"
1990,Finland,Flight attendants' desynchronosis after rapid time zone changes,"<title>Flight attendants' desynchronosis after rapid time zone changes</title> <abstract>The aim of the present study was to measure perceived effects of rapid time zone changes on flight attendants' sleep length, quality, adaptation, and recovery time, and to clarify the individuals factors related to perceived desynchronosis after time zone changes. The mean age of 285 female subjects was 35.0 years and that of 57 men was 34.1 years. The data were gathered by means of a questionnaire filled out by all Finnish flight attendants who worked on transmeridian routes. The quality of sleep, perceived adjustment, and recovery times were dependent on the flight direction and on the number of time zones crossed. The effects of age, neuroticism, and sex partly explained the variation of perceived desynchronosis, which increased linearly with increasing age and neuroticism.</abstract>"

In this paper we report the heart rate (HR) response to positive pressure breathing (PPB) during and after RD from 6,096 to 15,239 m (20,000 to 50,000 ft) in a hypobaric chamber while breathing gas mixtures that simulate the product gas from MSOGS. Interbeat (R-R) intervals were recorded in 10 subjects while they breathed either Aviators' Breathing Oxygen (ABO), that is 99.5% oxygen, or 93% oxygen at two regulator settings: dilution and non-dilution. Additional experimental profiles on six subjects isolated the effects of hypoxia, anxiety, and PPB on HR changes after RD. Anxiety appeared to have the greatest effect. Most of the subjects showed increased HR and reduced HR variability after the onset of pressure breathing (immediately after decompression). As the exposure continued, HR variability increased as the HR began to decline. No consistent change in the HR response could be attributed to the modest increase in hypoxia produced by substitution of 93% oxygen for ABO.</abstract>"
1990,United States,An empirical assessment of stress-coping styles in military pilots,"<title>An empirical assessment of stress-coping styles in military pilots</title> <abstract>Although aircraft pilots generally regarded as having superior stress-coping skills, there has been relatively little empirical research on how pilots cope with stress. New stress-coping models and measures for understanding and assessing these previously elusive processes greatly facilitate the empirical study of stress-coping styles. This study employed a new measure of stress-coping style, rationally developed from an integrative model of coping, to study stress-coping in U.S. Army pilots. Results indicated that the pilots preferred problem-focused stress-coping strategies oriented towards direct action to master stressful situations. Also, the pilots tended to deemphasize emotion-focused forms of coping with stress. Differences in stress-coping between pilots and samples of aircrewmen and non-rated military personnel suggest that this coping style reflects differences in psychological functioning independent from the pilots' adaptation to the aviation and military environment.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Relationship between occupational stress and social support in flight nurses,"<title>Relationship between occupational stress and social support in flight nurses</title> <abstract>Social support has been consistently implicated as a means of dealing with stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the levels of occupational stress and social support in flight nurses. Chosen by systematic random sampling, 160 flight nurses were asked to complete demographic, social support, and occupational stress questionnaires. Hans Selye's stress response model was used as the conceptual framework. The 113 respondents were predominately white females with university preparation. They reported low levels of occupational stress and high levels of social support (r = 0.42, p < 0.01). Statistically significant (p < 0.01) negative correlations were also found between social support and three of the four occupational stress subscales: job dissatisfaction, organizational stress, and somatic distress. The results of this study support the hypothesis that high levels of perceived social support are associated with low levels of perceived occupational stress.</abstract>"
1990,France,Clinical aspects of inflight incapacitations in commercial aviation,"<title>Clinical aspects of inflight incapacitations in commercial aviation</title> <abstract>Sudden incapacitations can affect a pilot and even a whole crew during a flight, preventing them from performing their task in complete safety. In some cases, they could even cause an accident. Our study examines the causes of sudden in-flight incapacitation in Air France pilots and flight engineers from 1968-88. Ten cases were reported out of a population of 1,800 cockpit crew, each flying an average of 600 h/year. These incapacitations were due to cardiac disorders (1 atrial fibrillation, 1 sinus tachycardia), epileptic attacks (2 generalized seizures), duodenal hemorrhages (2cases), infection (1 case of severe vertigo due to viral labyrinthitis), metabolic disorders (1 case of hypoglycemia), and sometimes disorders affecting the whole crew (1 case of hypoxia due to a pressurization deficiency, 1 case of CO<inf>2</inf> intoxication caused by the inadequate packaging of a container refrigerated in dry ice) Seven times out of ten, incapacitations occurred during cruising, twice during approach, and once on the ground before starting up, with closed doors (CO<inf>2</inf> intoxication). Two of these incapacitations led to flight diversions. None of them caused an accident. In this series, incapacitations of a cardiac nature were rarer and less serious than those caused by gastrointestinal or neurological disorders. Prevention is based on detection during systematic medical check-ups, and on crews being trained to recognize subtle incapacitations early and to ensure that the flight continues safely when such a case occurs.</abstract>"
1990,France,Voice analysis to predict the psychological or physical state of a speaker,"<title>Voice analysis to predict the psychological or physical state of a speaker</title> <abstract>A vocal message, apart from its semantic content, carries information on the psychological and physiological condition of the speaker. Physical fatique and especially psychological stress are the pathological elements of the condition. The accepted term for the cause of these effects is the 'workload'. This article describes the main research carried out since the 1940's to measure the acoustic modifications of the voice brought about by a workload. It concludes by a critical analysis of the studies and a short descriotion of the perspectives for research. Their results mainly concern astronauts and pilots involved in specific highstress tasks and possible users of voice recognition systems. All the studies show an excellent apprach to this field of research but deserve to be widened, deepened, and made more accurate to enable estimating the nature or level of reaction to a workload.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Medical impact analysis for the Space Station,"<title>Medical impact analysis for the Space Station</title> <abstract>Since the Space Station Health Maintenance Facility can house only a relatively limited quantity of supplies and equipment, the decisions about what should be included must be based on documented research. In this study, Space Station medical care priorities were determined by a medical impact analysis of two analog populations, U.S. Army and U.S. Navy personnel. Diseases and injuries in the International Classifation of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were ranked, using a Medical Impact Score (MIS) combining modified incidence rate and a function of disease outcome. The validity of the analysis method was tested by measuring rank order correlation between the two analog populations. Despite virtually identical age and sex distributions, Army and Navy incidence rates differed significantly for half of the ICD-9-CM categories, p<0.05. Disability rates differed for 76%, p<0.05. Nevertheless, Army and Navy MIS rank orders for categories and sections were not significantly different, p<0.001. In critical ways, the Space Station will be a safer environment than Earth. Cardiac events, musculoskeletal injuries, affective psychoses, and renal calculi were among the highest scoring categories.</abstract>"

1990,United Kingdom,Human error on the flight deck.,"<title>Human error on the flight deck.</title> <abstract>Despite terrorist bombs and structural failures, human error on the flight deck continues to account for the majority of aircraft accidents. The Royal Air Force (RAF) Institute of Aviation Medicine (IAM) has investigated the psychology of such error since the early 1970s, and to this end has used two principal techniques. The first has involved assisting in the official inquiries into both RAF and civil flying accidents, and the second has involved setting up a reporting system that permits any commercial pilot to report his own everyday errors, in complete confidence, to the RAF IAM. The latter system possesses the clear benefit of gathering error data untainted by considerations of culpability, and sometimes permits system rectification before the occurrence of accidents. This paper examines selected examples of errors associated with the design of equipment and with the social psychology of crews, and suggests that some consideration of the psychology of organizations may be necessary to ensure that the problems of human error are given the degree of consideration they require.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Vection and simulator sickness.,"<title>Vection and simulator sickness.</title> <abstract>Simulator sickness has been identified as a form of motion sickness in which users of simulators exhibit symptoms characteristic of true motion sickness. In a fixed-base simulator, visual and vestibular sources of information specifying dynamic orientation are in conflict to the extent that the optical flow pattern viewed by the pilot creates a compelling illusion of self-motion, which is not corroborated by the inertial forces transmitted through the vestibular sense organs. Visually induced illusory self-motion is known as vection, and a strict interpretation of sensory conflict theory of motion sickness suggests that vection in a fixed-base simulator would be a necessary precondition for simulator sickness. Direct confirmation of this relation is reported in this article.</abstract>"

1990,United States,"Psychological, psychiatric, and interpersonal aspects of long-duration space missions","<title>Psychological, psychiatric, and interpersonal aspects of long-duration space missions</title> <abstract>America’s future in space calls for manned missions that are of long duration and increasing complexity. Under these conditions, psychological and interpersonal stressors will take on added importance in affecting the safety of the crew and the outcome of the mission. Through an analysis of reports from manned American and Soviet space missions and Earth-bound simulations, several psychological, psychiatric, and interpersonal issues can be identified that could affect the success of the space station and other long-duration space ventures. Psychological issues include sleep problems, alteration in time sense, demographic effects, career motivation, transcendent experiences, homesickness, and alteration in perceptual sensitivities. Psychiatric issues include anxiety, depression, and psychosis, psychosomatic symptoms, emotional problems related to the stage of the mission, and postflight personality changes. Interpersonal issues include interpersonal tension, decreased cohesiveness over time, need for privacy, and task vs emotional leadership. Steps can be taken to minimize the impact of these issues, both before and during the mission. © 1990 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

This cognitive processing is argued to be that of field dependence and field independence, for which exist psychobiological and cognitive assessment tests. Since there is an obvious economic advantage in the use of cognite testing, it is recommended that this could be used as an initial screening when selecting for astronauts. © 1990.</abstract>"
1990,United States,An outbreak of illness among aerospace workers,"<title>An outbreak of illness among aerospace workers</title> <abstract>A multispecialty panel of physicians evaluated a case series of 53 composite-materials workers in a large aircraft manufacturing facility who filed workers' compensation claims for illness labeled by the media as the 'aerospace syndrome'. Possible skin and respiratory tract exposures included formaldehyde, phenol, particulates, epoxy resins, and trace organic solvents, but measured concentrations were well below all regulatory and consensus standards. Most workers had histories of transient skin or respiratory tract irritation consistent with the known potential toxicity of these materials. None of the workers tested had immunoglobulin IgG or IgE antibodies to human serum albumin complexed with formaldehyde. A majority (74%) met DSM-III-R [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised] criteria for major depression, panic disorder, or both. Most of these psychiatric disorders were of a recent onset, correlating in time with the use of phenol- and formaldehyde-impregnated composite material. Psychosocial factors were thought to have played a major role in the high prevalence of illness in this group and should be evaluated directly in well-controlled epidemiologic studies of similar crisis-building situations in the future.</abstract>"

Plasma epinephrine increased with all three treatments and more with β<inf>1</inf>-blockade than with placebo. Plasma norepinephrine decreased with administration of β<inf>2</inf>-blockade. Thus neither β<inf>1</inf>- nor β<inf>2</inf>-blockade prevents an increase in blood pressure during acute flight phobia stress. Increased plasma epinephrine seems to be the sympathetic variable that is closest related to this increase in blood pressure. Norepinephrine may be less consistently related to the blood pressure rise during flight phobia stress as shown by the decrease in plasma norepinephrine with administration of β<inf>2</inf>-blockade.</abstract>"

The aim of the study was to characterize any differences in physiological parameters in relation to differences in psychosocial job characteristics. Analyses of variance were used to test differences between groups. The results indicated that waiters, the group reporting the most unfavourable working conditions, tended to have many cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians, who had relatively few cardiovascular risk factors, reported high decision latitude and many emotional reactions in their daily life and had relatively high cortisol and low prolactin levels in plasma. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1990,Japan,The ergonomic evaluation of eye movement and mental workload in aircraft pilots,"<title>The ergonomic evaluation of eye movement and mental workload in aircraft pilots</title> <abstract>This paper presents an experiment which examines characteristics of pilots’ scanning behaviour when using integrated CRT displays, and the changes in characteristics when pilots face abnormal situations. The subjects were five experienced pilots. They performed two modes of flight tasks, under normal and abnormal situations, in flight simulators with standard settings. The flight simulators were for a Boeing 747-300 (B747), which made use of electromechanical displays, and for a Boeing 767 (B767), equipped with integrated CRT displays. The results showed that the B767 pilots tended to gaze at the attitude director indicator which was displayed in the integrated CRT display. It was assumed that ‘gaze-type scanning’ might be one of the characteristics of pilots’ scanning behaviour in cockpits which use the integrated display. By employing subjective ratings and heart rate variability to measure mental workload, no differences in mental workload between the B767 pilots and the B747 pilots were observed. However, in abnormal situations, the changes in scanning pattern for B767 pilots were found to be smaller than those of the B747 pilots. It is concluded that the application of integrated displays helps pilots to obtain sufficient information more easily than electromechanical displays do, even under abnormal situations. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

This lack of association was observed for self-reported alcohol consumption, interview-established alcohol abuse and biochemical markers of alcohol intake. In addition, anomie was not predictive of change in alcohol use/abuse over 36 months, controlling for baseline levels of alcohol use and abuse and for relevant demographic factors. Measurement of anomie and alcohol use/abuse, the relative importance of anomie in various socioeconomic groups and issues related to prospective research on this topic are discussed.</abstract>"
1990,,Cardiovascular response patterns and speech: A study of air traffic controllers,"<title>Cardiovascular response patterns and speech: A study of air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>The present study examined the relationship between cardiovascular (CVS) response and speech among air traffic controllers (ATCs). During two one-hour work sessions continuous EKG, ear pulse, and audio recordings were obtained individually from 24 male ATCs. In one session the controller actively controlled aircraft, while in the other he worked in a support/coordinator position. Session time in both conditions was partitioned on the basis of audio recordings into four mutually exclusive activities: Radio/Phone Talk, Radio/Phone Listening, Casual Talk, and Silence. Change in cardiovascular response pattern as a function of these activities, as well as the influence of a series of moderator variables on cardiovascular response, was assessed by examining heart rate (HR) and the EKG R-wave to ear pulse interval (RPI) relative to a pre-session baseline. The RPI index was employed as a means of unobtrusively tracking blood pressure on a beat-by-beat basis. Although reliable, the overall changes in CVS response were modest. Speech-associated reactivity was expressed exclusively by the RPI index. HR changes were not evident in response to speech, rather, the HR index appeared to be most sensitive to situational demand. Discrepancies between the present pattern and magnitude of speech-associated CVS response and those reported previously are discussed in terms of the nature of speech in laboratory versus field settings and measurement methodologies.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Psychomotor screening for USAF pilot candidates: Selecting a valid criterion,"<title>Psychomotor screening for USAF pilot candidates: Selecting a valid criterion</title> <abstract>Subjects for this research were 153 prospective pilots who were tested on computerized versions of the Two Hand Coordination (2HC) and Complex Coordination (CC) psychomotor tests. Independent variables included five basic error scores associated with the two psychomotor tests. The criterion for pilot performance was conceptualized as a function of the number of flying hours required to graduate from Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPTFLY). Results of MANOVA and multiple regression analyses revealed that performance on the two psychomotor tests was significantly related to the criterion for pilot performance (UPTFLY). The multiple regression analysis resulted in 27.1% of the variability of UPTFLY being accounted for by psychomotor performance. When the data were reanalyzed using a pass/fail UPT criterion the variability accounted for remained high, suggesting an anomaly associated with sample selection. Undergraduate pilot training outcome (pass/fail) remains the most valid criterion for Undergraduate Pilot Training success.</abstract>"

In separate sessions, young and old pilots smoked one of three cigarettes containing either 0 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg of the active ingredient, delta 9 THC. They flew a calm and a turbulent flight in a light aircraft simulator at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hour (h) delay after smoking. Effects were found at 1 and 4 h after smoking in the turbulent flight conditions when 20 mg cigarettes were smoked. Drug dose level, age, weather conditions (i.e., task difficulty), and delay period all affected pilot performance. Most important, these variables produced cumulative performance decrements.</abstract>"
1989,United Kingdom,Application of airline pilots' hours to junior doctors.,<title>Application of airline pilots' hours to junior doctors.</title> <abstract>OBJECTIVE--To determine the staff required if the rules for airline pilots' hours of work are applied to junior doctors. DESIGN--Junior anaesthetists recorded their workload from 1 March 1988 to May 31 1988. SETTING--District general hospital. SUBJECTS--Two groups of three junior anaesthetists sharing a one in three rota to provide continuous emergency cover. INTERVENTIONS--By using the guidelines published by the Civil Aviation Authority in The Avoidance of Excessive Fatigue in Aircrews schedules were drawn up to cover the hours that junior doctors had been on duty. RESULTS--Each anaesthetist provided emergency and routine cover for 48-112 (mean 75) hours each week. To cover the work of six junior anaesthetists on an annual basis would require 26 doctors if they were working within the Civil Aviation Authority's guidelines. CONCLUSIONS--Junior anaesthetists' hours are much longer than those of airline pilots. Both professions entail considerable periods of monitoring interspersed with episodes of high demands on physical and cognitive skills. Errors induced by fatigue made by anaesthetists and pilots could result in death. The medical profession should define rules similar to those of the aviation authority to prevent junior doctors having to work unsafe numbers of hours.</abstract>
1989,United States,Effects of Daily Workload on Subsequent Behavior During Marital Interaction: The Roles of Social Withdrawal and Spouse Support,"<title>Effects of Daily Workload on Subsequent Behavior During Marital Interaction: The Roles of Social Withdrawal and Spouse Support</title> <abstract>This article examines daily variability in 2 marital behaviors, social withdrawal and the expression of anger, as a function of daily taskload at work. Thirty-three air traffic controllers (ATCs) and 27 wives completed surveys on 3 consecutive days. Subjective and objective indicators of daily workload (air traffic volume and visibility at the airport) were related to the couples' descriptions of the ATCs' behavior after work. Despite a positive association between withdrawal and anger, workload seemed to influence these 2 behaviors in opposite ways. On high spouse-support evenings, work overload was associated with increased social withdrawal and less expression of anger. Social withdrawal may help an aroused individual return to a baseline emotional and physiological state. By facilitating their stressed partner's social withdrawal, supportive spouses may buffer the effects of minor daily stressors.</abstract>"

The emphasis is upon the human element rather than the technical, and the contribution of thousands of scientists from medical, psychological, and allied disciplines whose dedication was vital to air supremacy. This required a symbiosis between them and aircraft engineers and, inter alia, courageous participation in operational missions or dangerous experiments. The price was, on occasion, tragedy. Individual instances are described, as are visits to operational air force squadrons. The tour concluded with a return to South Africa and the establishment of the first South African Aviation Medical Laboratory. In spite of the implementation of the knowledge gained during the tour, the laboratory was closed after the war.</abstract>"

The present prospective study of 416 air traffic controllers attempted to determine if a sub-group of Type A's who were disliked by their co-workers had significantly higher risk of injury than liked A's and all Type B's over a 27-month period. Liked B's were not different in terms of injury incidence from their not liked B counterparts (mean annualised rates of injury = 1.9 and 2.1 respectively); not liked Type A's had the highest rates of injuries of any group (8.5) including liked Type A's (3.8). Some psychological instruments were useful in discriminating the Type A not liked group from their liked counterparts and from the Type B's. These discriminating variables were used as covariates to determine if the relationship between being classified a not liked Type A and elevated injury incidence remained. Multiple regression analysis showed that distress from life events and being a not liked Type A remained significantly correlated with later injury (standardised coefficients 0.16 and 0.25 respectively). © 1989.</abstract>"

MDS analyses were applied to performance data obtained from expert and novice pilots during simulated air-to-air combat. The results of these analyses revealed that the performance of expert pilots is characterized by advantageous maneuverability and intelligent energy management. It is argued that MDS, unlike simpler metrics, permits the investigator to achieve greater insights into the underlying structure associated with performance of a complex task.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Cognitive demands in automation,"<title>Cognitive demands in automation</title> <abstract>As the nature of a task changes with increasing automation, so do the cognitive demands on the human operator. The present study examines the implications of such changes on subjective workload and automation design issues. A variety of tasks (continuous flight control, discrete target acquisition, and decision making) was used to tax the different cognitive systems. Each task could be performed alone or in combination with other tasks. Performance and subjective workload ratings, obtained by three workload scales, were examined as a function of the level of automation. Results demonstrated the usefulness of the multiple resource approach to task analysis. All three workload scales were found to be sensitive to the task demands. The Bedford scale was particularly impressive in distinguishing the different types of resources in demand. Both the multiple resource model's performance predictions and the subjective workload ratings were shown to be invaluable for decisions on how and what to automate.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Simulator induced syndrome: Evidence for long-term aftereffects,"<title>Simulator induced syndrome: Evidence for long-term aftereffects</title> <abstract>Pilots have experienced various adverse symptoms hours and even days following flight simulator training. This study surveyed pilots undergoing simulator training in an attempt to provide an initial gauge of the extent, severity, and possible risk factors of long-term (>1 day) simulator aftereffects. A three-part voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was used to gather data. We studied pilots of varying experience undergoing advanced flight training which included the use of flight simulators. Some 238 pilots participated in the study, and 196 completed the followup survey concerning long-term effects. Nine (4.6%) pilots experienced adverse symptoms 24 h or more after completion of their last simulator training, which they attributed to their recent simulator experience. Symptoms reported included: recurrent visual flashbacks, continued balance disturbance, and hand-eye discoordination. Three pilots (1.5%) reported difficulties flying aircraft. Pilot flight experience level, total simulator time, length of simulator session, and sex were not predictive of risk. This study suggests that long-term (>1 day) adverse aftereffects may occur following simulator training.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Effects of high visual taskload on the behaviours involved in complex monitoring,"<title>Effects of high visual taskload on the behaviours involved in complex monitoring</title> <abstract>A simulated air traffic control task was used to study the effects of prolonged monitoring on some of the behaviours (complex discriminations, interpretations, decisions, memory for actions taken) frequently associated with operational monitoring tasks, but seldom examined in laboratory vigilance studies. Forty-eight subjects performed the monitoring task under relatively high taskload conditions for 2h. Two types of critical events were employed. Simple events consisted of a readily detectible alphanumeric change; complex events (detection of two aircraft at the same altitude on the same flight path) required considerable information processing for detection. Behaviours following detection of each type of event enabled acquisition of data on short-term memory, decision time and errors, procedural errors, and motor movement time. Time to detect aircraft at the same altitude was found to increase significantly over the 2 h as did failures to detect these events; detection time for the simpler type of event showed no evidence of impairment, nor was any impairment found for any of the other task behaviours that were measured. The results are discussed with reference to previous studies which suggest that the extent to which attentional decline impairs complex monitoring performance may be related to the amount of information processing required for event detection. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Ltd.</abstract>"

The battery included tests of psychomotor and cognitive/perceptual abilities and personality/attitudinal characteristics. Results indicated that several of the BAT tests were able to improve the prediction of graduation/elimination from flight training and follow-on training recommendation (fighter or non-fighter aircraft) above that provided but currently used paper-and-pencil tests. It was concluded that several of the BAT performance measures were capturing skills and abilities related to flight training performance that are not being assessed by currently used selection instruments. Implications for pilot selection and classification procedures are discussed.</abstract>"

1989,United States,Space vehicle approach velocity judgments under simulated visual space conditions,"<title>Space vehicle approach velocity judgments under simulated visual space conditions</title> <abstract>There were 35 volunteers who responded when they first perceived an increase in apparent size of a collimated, two-dimensional perspective image of an Orbiter vehicle. The variables of interest included the presence (or absence) of a fixed reticle within the field of view (FOV), background starfield velocity, initial range to the vehicle and vehicle closure velocity. It was found that: 1) increasing vehicle approach velocity yielded a very small (but significant) effect of faster detection of vehicle movement, nevertheless, response variability was relatively large; 2) including the fixed reticle in the FOV produced significantly slower detection at the largest range and the magnitude of the effect was only about 15% of the one sigma value; and 3) increasing background star velocity during this judgment led to slower detection of vehicle movement. While statistically significant, this effect was small and occurred primarily at the largest range. A possible explanation for the last two findings is that other static and dynamic objects within the visual field may compete for available attention which otherwise would be available for judging image expansion; thus, the target's retinal image has to expand more than otherwise for its movement to be detected. This study also showed that the Proximity Operations Research Mockup at NASA/Ames can be used effectively to investigate a variety of visual judgment questions related to future space operations. These findings are discussed in relation to previous research and possible underlying mechanisms.</abstract>"
1989,Canada,Personal characteristics related to accident histories of Canadian pilots,"<title>Personal characteristics related to accident histories of Canadian pilots</title> <abstract>Over 8,800 returns of a questionnaire, distributed to Canadian pilots, were analyzed. Items were chiefly about life events, hobbies, humour, and characteristics which might bear on susceptibility to 'pilot error' accidents. Sets of items were compiled which discriminated whether or nor respondents had had an aircraft accident in the past 10 years. Around 70% of the respondents could be classified correctly according to the self-reported accident criterion. Somewhat over half the items were significant accident markers in at least one of four pilot-license categories examined. There was surprisingly little evidence of a 'macho' syndrome associated with aircraft accidents; for example, participation in relatively risky hobbies was often negatively related to accident history. This report, like much past research, is entirely retrospective, so that some significant accident markers may only reflect accident aftereffects. Since the questionnaire was not anonymous, however, a follow-up study on the prediction of future accidents is feasible and is being considered.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Communication as group process mediator of aircrew performance,"<title>Communication as group process mediator of aircrew performance</title> <abstract>This study of group process was motivated by a high-fidelity flight simulator project in which aircrew performance was found to be better when the crew had recently flown together. Considering recent operating experience as a group-level input factor, aspects of the communication process between crewmembers (Captain and First Officer), were explored as a possible mediator to performance. Communication patterns were defined by a speech act typology adapted for the flightdeck setting and distinguished crews that had previously flown together (FT) from those that had not flown together (NFT). A more open communication channel with respect to information exchange and validation and greater First Officer participation in task-related topics was shown by FT crews while NFT crews engaged in more non-task discourse, a speech mode less structured by roles and probably serving a more interpersonal function. Relationships between the speech categories themselves, representing linguistic, and role-related interdependencies provide guidelines for interpreting the primary findings.</abstract>"

1989,United States,Cognitive performance deficits in a simulated climb of Mount Everest: Operation Everest II,"<title>Cognitive performance deficits in a simulated climb of Mount Everest: Operation Everest II</title> <abstract>Cognitive function as stimulated altitude was investigated in a repeated-measures, within-subject study of performance by seven volunteers in a hypobaric chamber, in which atmospheric pressure was systematically lowered over a period of 40 d to finally reach a pressure equivalent to 8,845 m, the approximate height of Mount Everest. The portable cognitive test battery used, Automated Performance Test System (APTS), was specifically designed for field research under adverse environmental conditions as evidenced by compact computer design; automated test administrations, data storage, and retrieval; psychometric properties of stability and reliability; and factorial richness. Significant impairments of cognitive function were seen for three of the five tests in the battery; on two tests, grammatical reasoning and pattern comparison, every subject showed a substantial decrement. The results are discussed in terms of the impact of altitude on specific aspects of cognitive function and the importance of having sensitive and reliable instruments to monitor such effects.</abstract>"
1989,United States,The visually guided control of simulated altitude,"<title>The visually guided control of simulated altitude</title> <abstract>Simulated 'flights' over three different ground textures were used to examine people's ability to extract optical information useful for active regulation of altitude. The textures were regularly spaced lines as follows: 1) orthogonal to the direction of flight (latitude texture); 2) parallel to the direction of flight (meridian texture); and 3) both parallel and orthogonal (square texture). Visual constant velocity forward flight simulations were displayed on a CRT screen, and subjects asked to maintain one of three initial altitudes using a rate control stick. This task was made difficult by the presence of lateral (irrelevant) and vertical (relevant) 'wind gusts'. The attitude never varied as winds, forward speed, and vertical rate control resulted in only translational movements. Adjusted root mean square errors (ARMSE) showed altitude regulation was more difficult at higher altitudes and when flying over meridian textures. Refined analysis of a single subject's data showed that this was due both to poorer regulation of the vertical wind disturbance and to a tendency to confuse the lateral wind disturbance for a vertical disturbance.</abstract>"
1989,United States,A simulator-based approach to training in aeronautical decision making,"<title>A simulator-based approach to training in aeronautical decision making</title> <abstract>The effectiveness of a simulator-based approach to training pilot skills in risk assessment and decision making was evaluated in a sample of pilots enrolled in a university aviation science program. The 16 experimental group subjects received 4 hours (h) of classroom instruction designed to enhance pilot judgment skills, followed by 4 simulated cross-country flights during which several critical inflights events occurred. Subjects in the control group received classroom instruction in basic instrument flying, followed by simulator sessions emphasizing instrument flight. Measures of pilot judgment were obtained on all subjects before and after the training, and subjects in the experimental judgment-trained group performed significantly better on the posttraining simulation than did control group subjects. The findings suggest that significant gains in pilot decision-making skill can be obtained through the use of the judgment training materials along with simulator practice.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Communication indices of crew coordination,"<title>Communication indices of crew coordination</title> <abstract>The relationship between communication patterns and performance in 10 two-person flightcrews is explored with the aim of identifying speech variations which differentiate low- and high-error full mission simulator flights. Verbal data, transcribed from the videotaped performances, are treated as interactive sequences of speech events in which statements spoken by one crewmember are considered within the context of the other crewmember's prior and subsequent speech. Specific speech patterns characterized each crew, but the overriding findings included: a) marked homogeneity of patterns characterizing low-error crews, interpreted as the adoption of a standard form of communicating, and b) heterogeneity of patterns characterizing high-error crews, interpreted as the relative absence of a conventionalized form. Because conventions are regularities which confirm the expectations of those involved, predictability of crewmember behavior should be greater when standard conventions are followed. We conclude that such a practice can facilitate the coordination process and enhance crew performance.</abstract>"
1989,,The giant hand phenomenon,<title>The giant hand phenomenon</title> <abstract>The 'giant hand' is a form of recognized spatial disorientation. An experienced fighter pilot described the events leading up to ejection from his out-of-control aircraft. Investigation of the mishap found no flight control problems and attributed the accident to the giant hand phenomenon. A survey of tactical aircrews indicated that this form of spatial disorientation is not an unusual occurrence. Past training of aircrew to deal with this problem has been inadequate. Earlier reports of this phenomenon recommended attempting to recover the aircraft by grasping the stick using only the thumb and index finger rather than the entire hand. Further investigation to include simulation of this phenomenon in advanced spatial disorientation trainers should contribute to aviation safety.</abstract>

Critical difficulties in the measurement of life stress are discussed and a partial solution is suggested in the form of the Life Events Questionnaire (LEQ), an instrument on which individuals report the nature of stressful events, when they happened, and how much they concern them at the time of testing. The results show that the tendency to overassess or underassess the consequences of nonroutine events is consistent within individuals, but is unaffected by life stress levels on the artificial air traffic control simulation used. Analysis of LEQ results showed that high stress subjects had much higher chronic than acute stress scores (p less than 0.001), although the chronic and acute scores were virtually identical for low stress subjects.</abstract>"

For years the community has relied on computerized complications of such data. However, increasingly, examination of original records reveals that the report originators are not sufficiently thorough in completing the block sections of the form. As a consequence computerized searches for pre-escape and escape aircraft maneuvering and gyrations show these conditions to be dramatically under-reported. Several recent studies suggest this under-reporting approximates 100%. This is critical because the associated aircraft motions may adversely affect seat separation from the aircraft, degrading system stability, and aircrew safety.</abstract>"

Results imply that posteffects may be a more serious problem than previously considered; 45% of all those queried (N > 700) reported having experienced symptoms of simulator sickness; 25% of the symptoms lasted more than 1 h after leaving the simulator; and 8% lasted more than 6 h. Postexposure symptoms were classified into three categories: visuomotor (based on disturbances in oculomotor control; e.g., eyestrain), disorientation (based on disturbance in postural control; e.g., dizziness), and nausea (vagal/autonomic symptoms). A safety risk may be posed particularly by the moderately high frequency of symptoms involving postural disequilibrium. Guidelines for coping with risks are discussed.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Ascertaining the causal factors for 'ejection-associated' injuries,"<title>Ascertaining the causal factors for 'ejection-associated' injuries</title> <abstract>Determining the cause(s) for an ejectee's injuries is one of the more important and yet most difficult tasks associated with an ejection investigation. Selection of causal factors is often distorted by rumors and inaccurate teaching concerning how specific types of injuries occur and/or the consequences of using specific types of Aircrew Automated Escape Systems (AAES) and Aircrew Life Support Systems (ALSS) equipment. Unfortunately, aiding and abetting the selection of incorrect causal factors is the 'strength-in-numbers'-type legitimacy that many of these factors have acquired through frequent usage over the years. Thus, if one should query the Naval Safety Center computer concerning either 1) how many ejectees under certain conditions and/or using specific AAES/ALSS equipment sustained specific injuries, or 2) how many ejectee received a specific type of injury caused by a specific factor, that computer will obligingly and non-critically provide numbers. Because those numbers are generated by a computer, they gain an overwhelming appearance of irrefutability in demonstrating the correctness of any assessment that conforms. Careful, detailed investigation (and also general statistical investigation), however, often has revealed that these accepted causal factors either cannot be applicable or are of extremely doubtful applicability for the specific situations. This paper discusses some of the recent results of investigating many of the accepted causal factors and some methodologies that might aid an investigator in determining the causal factors. Also discussed in the value of admitting to not knowing the causal factor and the harm that can arise from guessing or joining the crowd in stating a causal factor in the Flight Surgeon's Report (FSR).</abstract>"
1989,United States,Geographic disorientation: Approaching and landing at the wrong airport,"<title>Geographic disorientation: Approaching and landing at the wrong airport</title> <abstract>Geographic disorientation in aviation operations results from the failure of an aircrew to recognize and/or maintain the desired position relative to the external ground and airspace environment. Becoming lost during flight, intruding inadvertently into unauthorized airspace, selecting a wrong airway, landing on the wrong runway, and approaching the wrong airport - with or without actual landing - are some examples of inflight geographic disorientation. This is a relatively common phenomenon that can be experienced by any pilot, regardless of experience level and the type of pilot certification. This paper analyzes 75 cases of geographic disorientation that occurred among air carrier pilots plus 16 cases among general aviation pilots between 1982 and 1987. Inflight geographic disorientation can result from a variety of aeromedical and human factors (aircrew, operational, environmental) which, interacting with each other, create the ideal conditions for the occurrence of this phenomenon. The adverse consequences of geographic disorientation for the aircrew, passengers and aircraft are delineated along with specific preventive measures.</abstract>"

Bragg, NC, on the Army's annual field exercise in the Middle East (Operation Brightstar) 68 received either placebo or 0.5 mg of triazolam once airborne on the first leg of their journey from the U.S. to the Middle East. Sleep and activity were measured during the flight by means of a wrist-worn activity monitor. Cognitive performance, mood, and sleepiness were measured 8 h after drug administration during a refueling stop in Europe. Triazolam did not increase the duration or improve the continuity of sleep during the 8-h flight from the U.S. to the refueling point. The scheduling of an inflight meal contributed to this lack of effect. There were no differences in mood or sleepiness between the two groups as assessed by the Profile of Mood States and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Ability to recall verbal material presented immediately prior to testing was impaired by triazolam 8 h after ingestion, as evidenced by fewer items recalled on the Logical Memory portion of the Wechsler Memory Scale. These results suggest that triazolam at a dose of 0.5 mg is unsuitable for use in long-range aerial deployments when unimpaired cognitive functioning is required immediately upon arrival.</abstract>"

After 6 weeks, medication had been discontinued, and his diastolic blood pressure remained within normal levels. The patient was subsequently returned to full flight status without recurrence of diastolic hypertension at followup 6 months later. Relaxation training, of which yoga is one type, has been reported in the medical literature to have wide clinical application. It should be considered as a nonpharmacological therapy adjunct or alternative for medical disorders among personnel in occupations (e.g., aviation) where the side effects from medications are of great concern and could be disqualifying from those duties.</abstract>"

Angular error from gravitational vertical in an alignment task was measured for 20 observers viewing through two window shapes (square, round), two initial orientations of a computer-generated space shuttle image, and the presence or absence of a stabilized optical alignment reticle. In terms of overall accuracy, it was found that observer error was significantly smaller for the square window and reticle-present conditions than for the round window and reticle-absent conditions. Response bias data reflected an overall tendency to undershoot and greater variability of response in the round window/ no reticle condition. These results suggest that environmental cuing information, such as that provided by square window frames and alignment reticles, may aid in subjective orientation and increase accuracy of response in a space station proximity operations alignment task.</abstract>"

1989,United States,Soviet space flight: The human element,"<title>Soviet space flight: The human element</title> <abstract>Building on past experience and knowledge, the Soviet manned space flight effort has become broad, comprehensive, and forward-looking. Their long-running space station program has provided the capabilities to investigate long-term effects of microgravity on human physiology and behavior, and test various countermeasures against microgravity-induced physiological deconditioning. Since the beginning of Soviet manned space flight, the biomedical training and preparation of cosmonauts has evolved from a process that increased human tolerance to space flight factors, to a system of interrelated measures to prepare cosmonauts physically and psychologically to live and work in space. Currently, the Soviet Union is constructing a multimodular space station, the Mir. With the emergence of dedicated laboratory modules, the Soviets have begun the transition from small-scale experimental research to large-scale production activities and specialized scientific work in space. In the future, additional laboratory modules will be added, including one dedicated to biomedical research, called the 'Medilab.' The longest manned space flight to date (326 d) has been completed by the Soviets. The biomedical effects of previous long-duration flights, and perhaps those of still greater length, may contribute important insight into the possibility of extended missions beyond Earth, such as a voyage to Mars.</abstract>"

Introducing the French Air Force Medicine Training Session, the author speaks about the psychological aspects in aviation medicine. Three points of pilots' psychology are developed: 1) the pilot's body as the source of intense sensations and as an object of important value; 2) the libidinal, narcissistic, and defensive aspects of the pilot's spirit; and 3) the pilot's environment with its characteristic relationships. These facts influence the medical approach and modify the physician-pilot relationship. The flight surgeon must pay attention and get ready for this specific practice.</abstract>"

Guidelines were developed for doing full-mission human factors research on crew member behavior during simulated air transport operations. The existing literature was reviewed and experienced investigators were interviewed. The fundamental scientific and practical issues of behavioral research in a simulation environment are discussed. Guidelines are presented for planning, scenario development, and the execution of behavioral research using full-mission simulation in the context of air transport flight operations. Research is recommended to enhance the validity and productivity of full-mission research by: validating the need for high-fidelity simulation of all major elements in the operational environment; improving methods for conducting full-mission research, and examining part-task research on specific problems through the use of vehicles which contain higher levels of abstraction (and lower fidelity) of the operational environment.</abstract>"

1988,United States,Age and airline accidents,"<title>Age and airline accidents</title> <abstract>The issuance of a commercial pilot's license is contingent upon the fulfillment of stated minimum flight time. These requirements imply that total flight time and aircraft flight time can be equated with safety. For this reason, aircraft accidents involving licensed, professional pilots become difficult to explain. This study examined the relationship of pilot experience to accidents by comparing pilots' age and experience in 188 accidents involving corporate/executive pilots. The more severe accidents were expected to involve younger, less experienced pilots. The data in this study, however, refute this expectation. The age, aircraft time, or total time difference between groups was not significant. More research, both in the field and under controlled conditions, may bring in the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of three hours of deprivation and subsequent smoking on mood in smokers while operating a computer simulation of an air traffic controller's job in a 2 × 2 (Deprived vs. Nondeprived × Nicotine vs. Nicotine Free Cigarettes) factorial design. Subjects operated the simulation for two 20 minute periods, and after each period subjects smoked a nicotine or nicotine-free cigarette. Mood was assessed prior to operating the simulation and before and after each cigarette was smoked. Contrary to predictions, mood generally changed as a function of the procedure and not deprivation status or type of cigarette smoked. © 1988.</abstract>"
1988,,Cabin staff's perception of the impact of flying on their physical health,"<title>Cabin staff's perception of the impact of flying on their physical health</title> <abstract>The impact on physical health of a long-term career in the cabin service sector of commercial airlines is not as yet well documented. For those in aviation medicine there is obviously a need to be aware of any physical effects which may occur, to enable them to provide appropriate advice. Equally, for reasons of safety, there is a requirement for an insight into the factors which impair the abilities of cabin staff to react effectively in an emergency. In this paper a study is reported in which the impact of various individual, operational and workload variables on physical health of cabin staff were assessed. A self-completion questionnaire was developed in which physical health was measured at the completion of the final sector of the flight by a modified version of the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire. Biographical data, roster information, pre- and post-flight measures of stress and fatigue and free-report data were also collected. The results demonstrated the multi-faceted influences on physical health, and the complexity of the interactions which exist between health, stress and fatigue. Although there is considerable individual variability, physical discomfort seems to be an 'occupational hazard' for cabin staff. The severity of the symptoms experienced were predominantly influenced by the employment status, age and length of employment of the individual. The data also indicate that operational and workload variables do play a role in the determination of the level of physical discomfort.</abstract>"
1988,United Kingdom,Sleep and wakefulness of the airline plot,"<title>Sleep and wakefulness of the airline plot</title> <abstract>There are two overriding concerns in the design of schedules for aircrew who have to cope with irregularity of their sleep due either to work at unusual times of the day or to time zone changes. The first is that aircrew must be able to achieve an acceptable sleep pattern, and this is likely to involve short periods of sleep and naps. These, in turn, depend on limits to duty hours. The second is that the arrangement of work must bear in mind that prolonged duty and duty at certain times of the day may both involve relatively low levels of performance, and modelling can identify the adverse interactions of these influences. It is also important that the quality of the sleep of the individual pilot is taken into consideration when there are undue difficulties in coping with irregularity of work.</abstract>"
1988,Russian Federation,Ethical problems of interaction between ground-based personnel and orbital station crewmembers,"<title>Ethical problems of interaction between ground-based personnel and orbital station crewmembers</title> <abstract>Manned missions onboard orbital stations Salyut-6 and Salyut-7 have led us to the conclusion that a long-term space mission can be viewed as a complex socio-man-machine system whose effectiveness largely depends on the quality of interaction between its subsystems. When analyzing and assessing the reliability of this system, it is important to consider ethical aspects, because they concern human relations, permeating its very component and in the long run determining its efficiency. Psychological and medical examinations before, during and after manned missions have helped us to identify the major points of interaction of the subsystems which require adequate monitoring and optimization using socio-psychological and organization-technical approaches: arrangement and evaluation of the quality of work, arrangement of proper leisure, psychological comfort in the interpersonality and intergroup relations during prolonged space missions. This paper also discusses adaptive changes in the mental and physical state due to prolonged exposure to space flight factors such as microgravity and confinement. © 1988.</abstract>"

1988,United States,Adult children of alcoholics - A treatable entity: An aviation case report,"<title>Adult children of alcoholics - A treatable entity: An aviation case report</title> <abstract>This is a case report of a male naval aviator, raised in an alcoholic environment, and the impact of that environment on his development and adult functioning. A review of the adult children of alcoholics syndrome is presented to help familiarize the reader with this evolving entity and its probable impact on aviation personnel. In the United States, current estimates indicate that parental alcoholism affects 27 million children. Only about 5% of these children are receiving any evaluation, supportive care, or treatment. This case of a naval aviator affected by this syndrome illustrates the need for its recognition and potential for treatment and modification of maladaptive behavior. As a treatment entity, recognition of the adult children of alcoholics syndrome will hopefully have a positive effect upon aviation safety and will help save a valuable national asset, our trained aviation personnel.</abstract>"
1988,Pakistan - Sweden,Military flight experience and sympatho-adrenal activity,"<title>Military flight experience and sympatho-adrenal activity</title> <abstract>Urine excretion levels of adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) were determined, and achievement, commitment to the task, difficulty, risk, activation, and tension were rated after the preparation or planning and after the performance of 245 missions by 21 attack pilots. The catecholamine excretion levels increased and the ratio NA/A decreased as a function of condition (lesson, preparation, and mission). From a confirmatory factor analysis it was found that the catecholamine reactivity during preparation (values corrected for basal activity) was affected by the perceived challenge potential of the mission. The reference A activity covaried with the total A reactivity during the missions, i.e., the higher the basal excretion levels the higher the reactions to the missions. A positive relationship was found between former flight experience (hours) and mean activity of A. The rate of increase of A was potentiated by nicotine. Potential explanations of the increase of A are discussed.</abstract>"
1988,Canada,The psychological health and stress of pilots in a labor dispute,"<title>The psychological health and stress of pilots in a labor dispute</title> <abstract>This study investigated the psychological stress and psychiatric symptomatology in a representative sample of pilots involved in a labor dispute with management. Standardized epidemiological psychometric instruments revealed that one quarter of the piltos could be labelled 'psychologically at risk' showing elevated symptoms of anger-hostility, paranoia, and obsessive-compulsiveness. A certain combination of personality scores with stress reactions was found to correctly classify pilots who were healthy vs. 'at risk' with 92% accuracy. Interviews with pilots revealed both general causes of stress associated with a labor dispute as well as specific and unique sources of disturbances threatening safety in the air.</abstract>"
1988,United States,Simulator induced syndrome in Coast Guard aviators,"<title>Simulator induced syndrome in Coast Guard aviators</title> <abstract>The incidence of adverse symptoms in Coast Guard aviators undergoing flight simulator training was determined. A voluntary, multi-part questionnaire was completed by 238 pilots. During the first simulator flight 64.3% of pilots reported at least one adverse symptom, 39.4% during the last flight. Simulator induced syndrome (SIS) was present in 47.1% of subjects during the first simulator flight, 23.5% during their last flight. Most subjects reported their symptoms as mild, with some symptoms rated as moderate or severe in nature. There was no statistically significant association (p > 0.05) between the development of SIS and flight experience, simulator experience, length of simulator session, or self-determined motion sickness susceptibility. There was a significant association (p < 0.05) between SIS development and the use of simulators with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Nine pilots experienced adverse symptoms at least 2 d after their last simulator flight. In conclusion, this study revealed that SIS occurs frequently, is more common when CGI is present, may recur, suggests an adaptative process, and may not be associated with some factors previously claimed.</abstract>"
1988,United States,A scale for the estimation of sleep problems in clinical research,"<title>A scale for the estimation of sleep problems in clinical research</title> <abstract>Problems in sleeping are widely prevalent in modern society and are often one of the presenting complaints of patients consulting physicians. In addition, there is scattered epidemiologic evidence and considerable clinical support that disturbed or inadequate sleep may be a risk factor for clinical emergence of cardiovascular disease and for total mortality. The role of sleep problems both as a precursor and as a sequela of disease states could be better delineated in large groups by the availability of a brief, reliable and standardized scale for sleep disturbance. Such a scale could also be used to evaluate the impact of different therapies upon sleep problems. This paper presents data from two study populations responding to three and four item self-report scales. From 9 to 12% of air traffic controllers reported various sleep problems to have occurred on half or more of the days during the prior month, whereas 12-22% of patients 6 months after cardiac surgery reported such frequent sleep problems. Utilizing data from the 6 and 12 month follow-ups, test-retest reliability of the three-item scale in cardiac surgery patients was found to be 0.59. Internal consistency coefficients for the three and four-item scales were 0.63 and 0.79 respectively. © 1988.</abstract>"
1988,United States,Pilot's attitudes toward alcohol use and flying,"<title>Pilot's attitudes toward alcohol use and flying</title> <abstract>Questionnaires were sent to a national sample of licensed pilots. Respondents reported their flying experience and their drinking behavior. They also indicated the number of drinks that they believed could be safely consumed 3 hours (h) before flying or driving, and estimated the numbers of hours a person should wait, after drinking, before attempting to fly or drive. Similar questions were included regarding marijuana use. Respondents were much more conservative in their attitudes toward the use of alcohol prior to flying than prior to driving. This relationship held both for the number of drinks judged safe 3 h prior to flying or driving and for estimates of the waiting interval that would be appropriate following alcohol consumption. In addition, attitudes toward alcohol use were related to respondents' own drinking behavior, with moderate and heavy drinkers more tolerant of alcohol use in flying and driving situations than abstainers.</abstract>"

1988,United States,Aircrew selection systems,"<title>Aircrew selection systems</title> <abstract>Research was conducted to develop and validate a computerized battery of psycomotor and cognitive tests to identify candidates who sould not either complete pilot training or be recommended for a fighter assignment after training. All or part of the battery of 15 tests was given to 1,622 Air Force Pilot candidates prior to training and their test scores were regressed against various flying performance measures. Two psychomotor tests and tests of perceptual speed, decision making speed, and memory function were found to be significant predictors of flying performance. An experimental pilot selection system using these results was found to have substantial practical value in reducing attrition from pilot training. Future research on computerized test development is discussed.</abstract>"

Self reports and flight instructor observations of motion sickness symptoms were collected after initial flights. No significant correlations were found between these two sources. Anxiety scores derived from the battery of anxiety questionnaires were correlated with self reports of motion sickness but not with instructor observations. Discussion focussed on the potential limitations of external observers in assessing motion sickness, the convergence of anxiety assessments, and the overlap between anxiety and motion sickness symptoms. Methodological and practical implications conclude the review.</abstract>"

1988,Argentina,Neuropsychiatric observations of proprioceptive sensitivity in motion sickness susceptibility,"<title>Neuropsychiatric observations of proprioceptive sensitivity in motion sickness susceptibility</title> <abstract>The assessment of motion sickness susceptibility is still an unsolved problem, due in part to its unclear etiology. We studied 16 referred patients suffering from 'idiopathic motion sickness' and 4 pilots suffering from motion airsickness. All clinical and neurological tests proved negative, including electroencephalograms, electronystagmograms, Doppler studies, and computerized tomography of the brain. Cervical spine X-rays and personality characteristics were assessed. Simultaneously, 35 asymptomatic pilots and pilot applicants were studied as controls. Both groups were exposed to cross-coupled accelerations on a Barany chair at 15 rpm along with 0.5 Hz head flexions. The pathological group showed a straightened cervical curvature as well as a significantly higher degree of malaise (scale of Graybiel and Lackner). Their personalities were highly alexithymic or obsessive compared to the control group (Kruskal-Wallis Test). Alexithymic and obsessive personalities may express their stress reactions and psychic conflicts through somatic signs, such as cervical muscle contractures; consequently, straightening the cervical spine with the subsequent alteration of proprioceptive inputs to the vestibular nuclei may increase motion sickness susceptibility.</abstract>"
1988,Poland,Type a behavior pattern and illness other than coronary heart disease,"<title>Type a behavior pattern and illness other than coronary heart disease</title> <abstract>The paper presents three independent studies. Two are retrospective and one prospective. In the first study three equal groups of subjects participated: 30 myocardial infarction patients, 30 peptic ulcer patients and 30 healthy controls. The second study was run on three groups of military pilots: 36 had diverse cardiological problems, 47 were peptic ulcer patients and 64 were healthy control pilots. The prospective study included military pilots too. The Jenkins Activity Survey, Form C was used to assess the Type A behavior pattern in all subjects. The results of all three studies show high consistency. Persons with circulatory disorders obtained similar scores on Subscale A as those with digestive disorders, and both groups of patients scored significantly higher than the healthy controls. A similar pattern of data was found for the Speed and Impatience Subscale. © 1988.</abstract>"
1988,Argentina,The right and wrong stuff in civil aviation,"<title>The right and wrong stuff in civil aviation</title> <abstract>Aircrewmembers (ACMs) enter a mortally hostile environment when they take off from Earth in their flying machines. Their physiological adaptation has been augmented and supported through ergonomics, avionics, and engineering, but no such thechnological aid helps them adapt their minds to that atypical condition. They must rely upon their own psychic resources, i.e. 'aeronautical motivation' in the three levels of consciousness, and defense mechanisms to counteract their 'aeronautical anxiety.' Various relationship of motivation and defense give rise either to the flying adaptation syndrome or the various forms of the secondary flying disadaptation sydrome when ACMs must face the dangers of flight. These alterations of the ACMs' psychic balance may cause temporary or permanent medical disqualification due to the impairment of safety which they provoke. This paper proposes an analysis of the interplay between motivation, psychic defenses, and aviation stress to explain the manifestations of flight adaptation and disadaptation seen in some aircrewmembers.</abstract>"
1988,United Kingdom,Post accident/incident counseling: Some exploratory findings,"<title>Post accident/incident counseling: Some exploratory findings</title> <abstract>An examination of the literature, and other sources of information, suggested that there might be prophylactic value in early psychological intervention following crewmember involvement in stressful incidents. An exploratory study, at a small commercial pilot base (c.200 pilots), was undertaken to assess the value of early intervention. Pilots were automatically referred to an independent counseling service if abnormal flight events were judged to have involved sudden, unanticipated, or extreme stress. While some individuals came through their experience relatively unaffected, a surprising proportion did not . Several individuals took the opportunity to voluntarily return for additional counseling while others required anxiolytic drug treatment. The initial findings of this exploratory study strongly suggest that commercial pilots are more frequently subject to a potentially debilitating stress reaction than heretofore suspected. This has obvious implications for intervention and prevention, as well as long-term stress management for commercial pilots.</abstract>"

No hematological abnormalities were observed. One pilot had serum creatinine above 150 mmol·L-1; 48 airmen had serum cholesterol above 8.9 mmol·L-1; 15 had blood glucose above 7.9 mmol·L-1. The pilots had significantly lower serum triglycerides, ALAT, and ASAT than the captains. Fifty airmen had G-GT values above 50 IU·L-1. This group was urged to reconsider their alcohol habits and given medical and psychological advice as indicated. In this group the mean G-GT fell from 89 to 37 IU·L-1 during a period of approximately 2 years. No change in G-GT values was observed in those airmen who had a normal initial value. This study demonstrates the value of routine biochemical testing for airmen, particularly as regards blood glucose, serum cholesterol, and G-GT.</abstract>"

The spontaneous variations in job strain (determined as the self-reported ratio between psychological demands and decision latitude) were substantial. The average difference between the occasion with the highest level of strain and the occasion with the lowest level was 25% of the total mean. Systolic blood pressure during workhours, as well as self-reported sleep disturbance, increased when demands increased in relation to decision latitude. Among men with a depressive tendency (according to a diary) morning plasma protein prolactin levels increased markedly with increasing job strain. Among subjects with a positive family history of hypertension the increase in systolic blood pressure at work was particularly pronounced, and among the men in this group a lower than expected level of morning cortisol was found measured during the period with the highest level of strain.</abstract>"

1987,United States,Recurrent +Gz-induced loss of consciousness.,"<title>Recurrent +Gz-induced loss of consciousness.</title> <abstract>G-LOC--+Gz-induced loss of consciousness--results in significant acute incapacitation, including a period of unconsciousness lasting approximately 15 s followed by an additional period of approximately 15 s of confusion and disorientation. During routine experimentation for other purposes, four individuals experienced recurrent (3-5) episodes of G-LOC over 6-15 min. While G-LOC was neither an intended nor a desired event, we acknowledged the difficulty of stopping very high onset +Gz (VHOG) runs rapidly enough on the basis of visual endpoints to avoid occasional G-LOCs, which occurred in this limited series of experiments at a greater rate than in our more typical protocols. The requirement to define physiologic responses of fliers to operationally-relavent VHOG profiles made the development of these data pertinent and necessary. The recurrent G-LOC episodes accentuated the psychologic reactions experienced by the subjects, and allowed detailed analysis. Three of the individuals underwent detailed psychiatric interrogation to define the resultant G-LOC reactions. In addition to the post-G-LOC difficulty in recognizing the unconsciousness episode due to amnesia, specific psychologic reactions such as suppression (denial) further complicate one's ability to recognize the episode. G-LOC episodes may also lead to a reduction in combat readiness and aggressive capability in aerial combat. Recovery from G-LOC occurs in phases characterized by specific psychologic factors. The major psychologic reactions following G-LOC include confusion, disorientation, suppression of G-LOC recognition, unreliability, altered judgment, embarrassment, dissociation, euphoria, anxiety, fear, antagonism, and a ""give-up"" attitude.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract>"

The present study was designed to explore the degree to which these results could be generalized to complex, real-world tasks. The study also examined the relations among performance-based, subjective, and psychophysiological measures of operator workload. Seven male volunteers,enrolled in an instrument flight rule (IFR) aviation course at the University of Illinois, participated in the study. The student pilots flew a series of IFR flight missions in a single-engine, fixed-based simulator. In dual-task conditions subjects were also required to discriminate between two tones differing in frequency and to make an occasional overt response. ERPs time-locked to the tones, subjective effort ratings, and overt performance measures were collected during two separate 45-min flights differing in difficulty. The difficult flight was associated with high subjective effort ratings, as well as increased deviations from the command altitude, heading, and glideslope. The P300 component of the ERP discriminated among levels of task difficulty, decreasing in amplitude with increased task demands. Within-flight demands were examined by dividing each flight into four segments: takeoff, straight and level flight, holding patterns, and landings. The amplitude of the P300 was negatively correlated with deviations from command headings across the flight segments. In sum, the findings provide preliminary evidence for the assertion that ERP components can be employed as metrics of resource allocation in complex, real-world environments.; Previous research has indicated that components of the event-related potential (ERP) may be used to quantify the resource requirements of complex cognitive tasks.

As visual-cognitive stress are used tachistoscopically presented instrument symbols under conditions of individual speed of work and time pressure. The results of the compared extreme groups consisting of pilots with good and insufficient flight performance showed that the pilots with impairments to the quality of flight activity differ already before the test in their individual habitual characteristics and actual motivation, during the stress in their operational parameters, in the dimensions of their cardiorespiratory activation as well as in their efficiency and after the stress in their subjective experience of the stress. Conclusions are drawn for the evaluation of the aptitude of pilots and cosmonauts. © 1987.</abstract>"

The psychological impact that grounding has on a flier may not only represent a serious pathological process in itself, but may also detrimentally affect the flight surgeon's relationships with other crewmembers. Grounding represents a loss to the aviator, the severity of which varies with pre-morbid motivation to fly. As a loss, grounding elicits grief; this must be dealt with effectively by the patient, with the help of the flight surgeon, or an unresolved grief reaction may cripple the ex-flier and hinder the flight surgeon's effectiveness.</abstract>"

Every urine sample for a period of nine days, commencing 2 days before the flight, was collected. The volume and time the sample was passed were recorded so that urinary cortisol secretion rates could be calculated. Mood was also rated on a scale scored 0-9 at the same time the urine sample was collected. A control group matched for age, sex ratio, and degree of manual labour involved in their occupation, but not involved with the flights, was included in the study for comparison. On the basis of urinary cortisol excretion rates, the crews in Sydney before the flight and in Los Angeles were more highly stressed than the control group. The urinary cortisol excretion rates were significantly greater than those of the control group in Sydney before the flight, in Los Angeles, and during the return flight, but not on the flight on. The high excretion rates before the flight were attributed to an apprehension factor, whereas the elevated values in Los Angeles and during the flight back were attributed to a disruption in circadian rhythm. A factor analysis of mood ratings showed three major factors assessing vitality, distress, and relaxation. Analysis of variance of the mood ratings showed significant changes over the tour of duty for 13 of the 14 moods. © 1987.</abstract>"

This study utilized data from 416 subjects in the Air Traffic Controller Health Change Study to track these associations across five examinations over a 3-year period. Following obesity, alcohol consumption was consistently the second-best predictor of blood pressure. Alcohol intake rose among those subjects who developed sustained elevated blood pressure during the course of the study. Further, obesity became less important in predicting blood pressure at higher levels of alcohol intake.

Depending on the risk factor involved, high scorers on these psychosocial risk predictors incurred from 80% to 252% more future accidental injuries and from 38% to 69% wore future total morbidity over a 27-month follow-up period than the men in the low scoring groups. Moreover, coworkerrated amicability, probably an indication of the amount of social support available to an individual, was significantly protective against these outcome variables, with the rarely or never chosen group experiencing 60% more total morbidity and 174% more injuries than the often chosen group. A multiple-regression equation revealed that stress, amicability, type A, and satisfaction with management had an additive effect on the outcome variables. Work- and non-work-related life change distress subscales were similar in their ability to predict later morbidity. Prediction was stronger for 27-month follow-up than for only the first 9-month period. The findings, if replicated, raise the possibility of screening programs to identify employees at high risk of future illness and injury. © by American Occupational Medical Association.</abstract>"

1987,Sweden,"Noise, vibration and changes in wakefulness during helicopter flight","<title>Noise, vibration and changes in wakefulness during helicopter flight</title> <abstract>The investigation was carried out in cooperation with the helicopter school AF 1 in Boden. Measurements were made in two different types of helicopter, Hkp 3 and Hkp 6. Three different parameters were recorded during the flights: noise, vibrations, and wakefulness. Noise and vibration exposures were mainly correlated to the main rotor energy and frequency. Both types of exposure were dominated by lower frequencies, below 10 Hz. Analyses of wakefulness during long-distance flights, about 4 h, and short-distance flights, less than 2 h, were based on EEG and EKG recordings. As expected the level of wakefulness was influenced by the stress upon the pilots. Take-offs and landings, as well as unexpected events during the flight, were correlated to an increased level of wakefulness. In some cases flying was correlated to a gradual increase of weariness. The correlation between weariness, types of flying, and the external environmental factors of noise and vibration, is also discussed.</abstract>"

1987,United States,The healthy motivation to fly: No psychiatric diagnosis,"<title>The healthy motivation to fly: No psychiatric diagnosis</title> <abstract>Aircrew mission effectiveness may uniquely be influenced by subtle psychological factors not ordinarily brought to the attention of psychiatrists. Pilots tend to be bright, articulate, and anxious to resume their aviation duties when grounded. However, these patients are usually well defended, and rarely psychologically attuned or introspective. Greater insight into what constitutes the normal, healthy motivation to fly help those who make judgments regarding the return of grounded aviators to flying duty. A review of associated birth order, personality theory, industrial business psychology, aerospace, and psychoanalytic literature is presented. Highlighted are the difficulties inherent in examining the motivation of a healthy, well-defended population. Our conclusion: an examiner's countertransferential feelings are the best available tool for measurement of healthy motivation.</abstract>"

1986,Israel,Systolic blood pressure in fighter pilots after 12-15 years service,<title>Systolic blood pressure in fighter pilots after 12-15 years service</title> <abstract>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured at entry and after 12-15 years in 112 fighter pilots and compared to 112 transport and helicopter pilots. The pilots were 20-24 years old on entry into the study. Mean SBP ± 1 S.D. on entry was 122 ± 12 mm Hg in fighter pilots and 124 ± 12 mm Hg in transport and helicopter pilots. After 12-15 years follow-up the mean SBP was 118 ± 12 mm Hg in both groups. We conclude that the stress of flying fighter aircraft for 12-15 years is not associated with an increased risk of hypertension.</abstract>
1986,United Kingdom,"Circadian arrhythmia: Shiftwork, travel and health","<title>Circadian arrhythmia: Shiftwork, travel and health</title> <abstract>There are many reasons why employees' working hours may come into conflict with the inherent (circadian) rhythms of their bodies. Vital services such as police, ambulance, hospitals, electricity must be maintained 24 hours a day; expensive equipment is more profitable if used continuously; machinery such as furnaces may be damaged if shut down.Work patterns which conflict with our circadian rhythms may produce fatigue, a tendency to make errors, accident-proneness, 'jet-lag' and perhaps ill health.Those most at risk are shiftworkers and aircrew: whilst the latter must cope with changing shift patterns and time-zone changes, the former are required to adapt to changes in work/sleep patterns against an environmental background disruptive to such an adaptation.More difficulties arise when we consider those with chronic health problems since employees on long-term medication may not be able to reconcile an unvarying drug regimen to an ever-changing work pattern. Furthermore, there is evidence that the potency of drugs may vary according to the time of administration.There is much to be learned about the health effects of shiftwork; here we review what is known. © 1986 Johns Wright & Sons Ltd.</abstract>"

Following recent debates in the literature of collective action two hypotheses are considered. Explanations stressing relative deprivation are examined, as well as interpretations based on the propositions of the resource‐mobilization approach. In the case studied here it appears that resources are indeed the crucial factor in explaining the timing of the conflict. However, the dynamics of the conflict cannot be fully understood unless socio‐psychological factors are included. Research methodologies taking account of these two dimensions must be elaborated to study conflict. Cet article examine les facteurs qui expliquent le moment historique du conflit qui opposa les groupes francophone et anglophone dans le contrôle de la navigation aérienne en 1975–76. Les contributions théoriques de deux courants divergents dans la littérature sociologique contemporaine sont retenues. Les facteurs psycho‐socioiogiques tels que les sentiments de frustration et d'insatisfaction privilégiés par le modèle dit de privation relative sont examinés. Les facteurs structuraux tels que l'organisation et la disponibilité de ressources nouvelles mis de l'avant dans l'approche mobilisation de ressources sont aussi invoqués.

1986,United States,Advanced concepts flight simulation facility,"<title>Advanced concepts flight simulation facility</title> <abstract>The cockpit environment is changing rapidly. New technology allows airborne computerised information, flight automation and data transfer with the ground. By 1995, not only will the pilot's task have changed, but also the tools for doing that task. To provide knowledge and direction for these changes, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Lockheed-Georgia Company have completed three identical Advanced Concepts Flight Simulation Facilities. Many advanced features have been incorporated into the simulators - e g, cathode ray tube (CRT) displays of flight and systems information operated via touch-screen or voice, print-outs of clearances, cockpit traffic displays, current databases containing navigational charts, weather and flight plan information, and fuel-efficient autopilot control from take-off to touchdown. More importantly, this cockpit is a versatile test bed for studying displays, controls, procedures and crew management in a full-mission context. The facility also has an air traffic control simulation, with radio and data communications, and an outside visual scene with variable weather conditions. These provide a veridical flight environment to evaluate accurately advanced concepts in flight stations. © 1986.</abstract>"

1986,United States,Assessing fatigue.,"<title>Assessing fatigue.</title> <abstract>Despite impressive advances in aircraft technology over the past several decades and an overall decline in the airline accident rate since the introduction of turbine-powered aircraft, flight crew performance problems continue to dominate air transport accident statistics. Researchers have offered many hypotheses to explain this finding, and interest in pilot fatigue has stimulated a large volume of laboratory research. Much of this work, however, is difficult to generalize and to apply to the real world of flight operations, and researchers disagree about the extent and operational significance of fatigue-related reductions in pilot performance. As a result, in 1980 Congress asked the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to undertake a comprehensive research program to assess whether fatigue-related problems are prevalent in long- and short-haul flying. The two major goals of this project are: (1) to assess the psychophysiological effects on pilot performance of flying various types of flight and duty cycles, and (2) to determine the operational significance to flight safety and efficiency of flying these flight and duty cycles.</abstract>"

The complexity of the problem is outlined with regard to identifying the nature and extent of decayed skills. It is suggested that cognitive/procedural skills are more prone than control-oriented skills to decay over periods of disuse. Effective recurrent training methods offer the most promise in forestalling loss of proficiency. Several such methods are described, and the importance of cognitive training is emphasized. Finally, criteria are noted for evaluating the utility of recurrent training media. The theories and practical measures discussed apply to many skills other than those of flying.</abstract>"

Various arrangments of motor response (vocal, hand) and HDD images were used. In the first experiment, vocal and manual response times were recorded in a current fighter aircraft mock-up situation. The shortest times were obtained for voice responses. The time elapsed between a HUD signal and the simple response to the HDD was approximately 1600 ms. The time for physical transition where accomodation changes occur was 700 ms. In the second experiment, two types of images were displayed on the HDD: a 'positive' contrast (green symbol on black background), and a 'negative' contrast (black symbol on green background) in order to compare accommodation to structured and unstructured backgrounds. Perception time was significantly shorter for the 'positive' contrast, and transition times were similar to those measured in the first experiment. This method permits the evaluation in a dynamic aeronautical environment of the acquisition and processing of information. Changes in psychological conditions (heavier information processing) and/or physiological conditions (changing accomodation, gaze axis, convergence) can be evaluated in future research.</abstract>"

1986,United States,"Flying and danger, joy and fear","<title>Flying and danger, joy and fear</title> <abstract>U.S. Air Force fliers are all volunteers who undergo rigorous training for their profession. Their motivation may be deeprooted and emotional, or may arise from a conscious decision made in early adulthood. Some motivation is flawed and fails early. Other motivation may be eroded by a single dangerous event, by an accumulation of 'close calls' (one's own or others'), or by a growing interest in nonaviation elements. Since Air Force fliers may 'quit' only at some personal cost to pride or pocketbook, they may develop a fear of flying. This may be truly phobic, a situational reaction, or an awareness of personal vulnerability. Some displace anxiety about flying into somatic symptoms. The author discusses motivation to fly, its various modes of failure, and some clinical aspects of fear of flying.</abstract>"
1986,United States,The flight surgeon and psychiatry: Interest and skills,"<title>The flight surgeon and psychiatry: Interest and skills</title> <abstract>Much of the flight surgeon's day-to-day clinical practice involves the use of psychiatric skills in the assessment and management of the problems of flyers and their families. Folkore holds that among nonpsychiatrists, the older, more experienced, nontrainee clinician is more interested in and knowledgeable about the psychiatric aspects of his practice. We studied this assumption in 170 flight surgeons who varied in age, experience, and whether or not they were presently in training or had already completed training in flight medicine. Measures of interest in psychiatry and self-assessed ability in seven areas of psychiatric skills and knowledge were obtained. Results indicate that age and experience are unrelated to interest in psychiatry, while being in training has a significant negative impact. Self-assessed ability is significantly related to training status, age, and experience. The flight surgeon's subjective assessment of needing further education was increased by being in a training status, but unaffected by age or experience.</abstract>"
1985,Norfolk Island - United States,Age and pilot performance,"<title>Age and pilot performance</title> <abstract>In military and civilian aviation, pilot age is a major factor which determines if the individual is allowed to continue flying. Many factors, including legal considerations, escalating personnel and training costs, and higher skill levels necessitated by increasing equipment complexity, have generated considerable interest in the development of 'age free' criteria to determine continued suitability for aviation duty. Central to this issue is a demonstration that older pilots are not necessarily unsafe pilots. Naval Safety Center data relating mishap rates and causal factors to pilot age are presented and policy implications discussed. Results indicate that there are significant differences in mishap rates and mishap causal factors as a function of age, but these differences are not those which might be expected based on a knowledge of the aging literature.</abstract>"

1985,United Kingdom,The endocrinology of stress,"<title>The endocrinology of stress</title> <abstract>With the advance in hormone assay techniques it has been demonstrated that stress may be characterised by a number of endocrinological changes which are not limited solely to the secretion of catecholamines and adrenal steroids. This article reviews the effects of various stressors on these and other hormones. Aviation is a source of a wide range of stressors including radial acceleration (+Gz) Since its magnitude and duration may be controlled experimentally by using the human centrifuge, it is possible to quantify such a stressor when investigating endocrinological markers of stress. Sustained +Gz acceleration results in a 'dose-dependent' secretion of cortisol, i.e. the higher the acceleration, the greater the cortisol secretion. In addition, increases in the concentrations of arginine vasopressin and catecholamines occur but these are not accompanied by changes in prolactin or growth hormone.</abstract>"

Our research measured both the variability of color matching and the offsets from a match necessary for a 100% discrimination difference. We did this for four dominant wavelengths each at five saturation levels. Our subjects were tested at low, medium, and high adaptation levels for both large and small test stimulus sizes. In general, our results for the low luminance color matching conditions are in agreement with the published literature. For the high luminance and small field conditions, our data suggest that color discrimination should not be predicted from the 1960 CIE Uniform Chromaticity Space data. Color discrimination varies dramatically with dominant wavelength; reds and greens are more difficult to discriminate than yellows and yellow-greens.</abstract>"

Some general aspects of 'background' occupational stress are discussed. Attitudes and opinions of professional aviators are identified and their role in denial of symptomatology is developed. The concept of the Pilot Advisory Group (PAG) is then discussed in detail before its role in relation to occupational stress is introduced. While some of the better known problems associated with occupational stress in pilots are mentioned, the emphasis in the paper is on developing new perspectives regarding the identification of stress-induced dysfunction, and also in exploring the suitability of PAG involvement. The formal obligations of management and regulatory authorities are contrasted with what the author sees as the countervailing imperatives of pilot attitudes and beliefs.</abstract>"

During the first 24 h, there was a significant and sustained increase in plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon. Plasma catecholamines showed significant increases only at 0.25 and 0.50 h, returning to control levels between 1.0-24 h; blood lactate paralleled the catecholamines' response. Plasma free glycerol showed a significant and sustained decrease during the first 24 h. Liver glycogen was significantly increased at 0.50 h, with progressively larger amounts accumulated as the exposure time was extended to 24 h. Diaphragm muscle glycogen was significantly decreased at 1.0 h, but showed a significant increase at 24 h. The isolated diaphragm muscle tissues from these rats were also studied in vitro to determine insulin effect on glucose uptake. Muscle tissues obtained from noncentrifuged controls and incubated with insulin (0.3 mU·ml-1) in the medium showed significant increases in glucose uptake; in contrast, muscle tissues from centrifuged rats showed no insulin effect on glucose uptake. It is concluded that the initial, rapid rise in blood glucose of rats exposed to hyper-G stress is mediated by increases in circulating catecholamines and glucagon, both potent stimulators of hepatic gluconeogenesis; and that the sustained hyperglycemia may be due in part to the inhibition of the insulin-stimulated uptake by muscle tissues.</abstract>"

The results were summarized as follows. Eastward flights. Decrease of total sleep time, or increase of TST. Disturbances of intra-sleep cycles. Increase of slow wave sleep. Decrease of REM sleep in the amount. Prolonged REM sleep latency. Westward flights. Shortened sleep latency. Shortened REM sleep latency. Increase of percentage REM sleep. Unusual temporal distributions of REM sleep periods. Southward flight. No significant change. From all above mentioned it becomes evident that after transmeridian flight sleep rhythm is clearly disturbed. In this time we emphasized the changes in particular sleep rather than the overall changes in sleep-wake cycles. The changes in sleep pattern followed by time zone changes, however, are thought to result from a complicated summation of effects, such as sleep deprivation, sleep reversal, naps, shift in sleep onset time, and circadian rhythm alteration. The possible factors about the changes in sleep will be presented by Dr. Endo in the next lecture.</abstract>"

1985,United States,Airline pilot disability: The continued experience of a major US airline,"<title>Airline pilot disability: The continued experience of a major US airline</title> <abstract>This study details our continued experience with preemployment screening and medical disability in a large group of pilots from one airline from 1975 through 1982. During this period, 368 pilot applicants underwent preemployment screening and 73 of these were rejected for employment because of medical reasons. The majority (45) of these were unsuitable for psychological reasons. Medical disability accounted for approximately 20% of the pilots separated from the company during the period of study. Age-specific disability rates increased rapidly after age 45 years, with cardiovascular disease responsible for more than 50% of these medical losses. Disability rates of older pilots have decreased considerably compared with previous rates: the age-adjusted rate for pilots age 45 years or older has decreased from 27.50/1,000 person-years to 8.97/1,000 person-years (p<0.0001). The reasons for this reduction remain unclear, but changes in the interpretation of the Federal Aviation Administration regulations and changes in company policies may have contributed. The role of preventive medicine in the form of regular medical surveillance is uncertain, with no direct evidence of a beneficial effect.</abstract>"

1985,Germany,Significance of circadian rhythms for aviation and space operations,"<title>Significance of circadian rhythms for aviation and space operations</title> <abstract>Operational requirements in the aerospace environment interfere with the circadian system more frequently than in other fields of human activity. Conflicts can principally arise in several ways: when duty has to be performed as night- or shiftwork, when phase shifts in the environmental timing system occur, when the time cues in the environment change their frequency or intensity, and when they completely disappear. All these sources of interference have in common that they cause disparity between the internal 'body time' and the external time of the environment. The first type of conflict relates to the fact that pilots and astronauts must perform duty at abnormal times of the habitual 24-hour cycle, e.g. during night flights or extended mission periods. The problems encoutered are not specific for air and space operations, but are associated with shiftwork in general. The second type of conflict always arises when time zones are traversed. The resulting effects are specific for air operations due to the inherent high meridian crossing speed. The third conflict mainly concerns space operations, but in prinicipal can also occur in any other situation of partial or total deprivation from external periodic inputs, such as living in the Arctic, in social isolation, or in the confinement of a shelter. In the aviation and space environment all four conditions can become effective, singly or in combination, but producing always the same effect: a disturbance of the circadian timing system.</abstract>"

Also, all pilots over 60, no longer flying, continued to be submitted to the same medical, psychological and psychomotor tests as before. The number of incapacities and deaths was related to the number of pilots by age groups of 5 years from age 20-24 to 65-69, in a total of 1528 pilots at risk. Under age 60, the pilots' careers were interrupted for pathological reasons (8) and deaths (13), mainly through unforeseen severe diseases (13) and violent deaths (6). Over age 60, no deaths occurred and the majority of the psycho-physiological problems susceptible to being considered incapacitating (10) were expressed by expected degenerative disorders which were strictly connected with aging. The rate of incapacities became higher than under age 60, but 64% of over 60 examinees were absolutely fit for flight duties.</abstract>"
1985,Japan,The possible mechanisms of the disturbed circadian sleep-wake rhythm after time zone changes,"<title>The possible mechanisms of the disturbed circadian sleep-wake rhythm after time zone changes</title> <abstract>Changes in sleep after eastward flight. To go to bed at 2300 hr in SFO, which corresponds to 1600 hr in TYO, means that a traveller from TYO starts his sleep from evening nap in TYO. In evening naps, Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is increased and REM sleep is decreased. In the flight from West to East, however, the subjects experienced one night total sleep deprivation. Consequently, it is necessary to do research on naps after total sleep derivation. REM sleep is clearly increased in the morning and decreased in the evening in spite of one night total sleep deprivation. These findings indicate that the distribution of REM sleep is not affected by total sleep deprivation, but REM sleep has a clear circadian rhythm. By contrast, SWS is increased in the morning, afternoon and evening naps after total sleep deprivation. Thus, SWS is more independent of circadian effects and responsive to the length of prior wakefulness. From the findings mentioned above, it is assumed that the decrease of REM sleep and the increase of SWS in the first part of the sleep in SFO may be caused by effects of one night total sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm of REM sleep. Changes in sleep after westward flight. The sleep after returning home from east after the flight from TYO to LDN was different from that in baseline nights in TYO, with decreased REM sleep latency, appearance of SOREMs and increased REM sleep. Since the sleep after westward flight corresponds to that in the early morning to forenoon in the place before the flight, it is necessary to investigate the effect of sleep reversal and naps in daytime. In naps after one night total sleep deprivation, morning naps and had shortened REM sleep latency, increased REM sleep and frequent SOREMs. From the findings mentioned above, it is suggested that the nocturnal sleep after returning home from east and in LDN may reflect the circadian rhythm of sleep in the place before the start of the flight.</abstract>"
1985,United Kingdom,The impact of life events on pilots: An extension of Alkov's approach,"<title>The impact of life events on pilots: An extension of Alkov's approach</title> <abstract>Recent psychological thinking has expressed dissatisfaction with life events/life changes research. The cornerstone of such research in aviation studies is the work of Alkov. We adapted Alkov's approach and used it to see if we could extend our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the life events/accident and incident relationship. Alkov's 22-item questionnaire was expanded and administered by post as part of a much larger study. Replies were received from 442 commercial pilots working for British companies. Multivariate analysis revealed that the pilots merely regarded the 22 items as comprising three trends -Emotional Losses, Pilot Characteristics, and Emotional Gains. The overall conclusion proposes that, while Alkov's approach is interesting, expansion of it reveals that background contextual factors should be examined. Additionally, pilots' perception of the effects of life events on accident/incident potential is made on relatively broad discriminations, rather than on finely tuned judgements.</abstract>"
1985,United States,Behavioral airsickness management program for student pilots,"<title>Behavioral airsickness management program for student pilots</title> <abstract>The management of recurrent airsickness in student pilots has traditionally involved positive reinforcement of motivation and limited use of medication. The Behavioral Airsickness Management (BAM) program seeks to establish an effective behavioral and cognitive intervention format for managing airsickness symptoms. There were 37 student pilots experiencing recurrent airsickness who were exposed to an assessment and rehabilitation program designed to develop diaphragmatic breathing skills while rapidly reducing physiological tension via cue-evoked relaxation strategies. Cognitive modification techniques were also included in the treatment protocol. Of the 37 students, 35 were returned to their flying training program with no recurrences of the airsickness problems. Cross-validation evidence is offered, as well as hypotheses for the program's success.</abstract>"
1985,France,Medical assistance to travellers: a new concept in insurance-cooperation with an airline,"<title>Medical assistance to travellers: a new concept in insurance-cooperation with an airline</title> <abstract>Medical assistance to travellers is a new concept in insurance. Payment of a premium makes it possible in an emergency for a traveller, by means of a phone call, to obtain free medical support, i.e., on-the-spot treatment, repatriation, hospitalization, etc. This kind of service necessarily involves a 24-h telephone system; a network of national and international correspondents, physicians and nurses trained in resuscitation; and sophisticated medical equipment, aircraft, etc. This study gathered data on the activity across 1982 of such an assistance company, especially in its cooperation with a scheduled international airline for air evacuation of patients who had become ill or had been injured far from their homes. Of 1618 repatriated patients in the single year, 1241 were evacuated by air (247 of these by the airline involved in the study) mainly from Europe or Africa. Traumatology, cardiovascular diseases, and psychiatric syndromes were the main causes of air evacuation. Medical equipment and personnel were placed aboard aircraft based on the gravity of each case. Assistance contracts provide valuable back-up for travellers' medical and psychological safety; close cooperation with airlines is of prime importance, both to the patient and to airline operations.</abstract>"

As part of the programme of research related to the production of the Micropat automated testing system, a number of studies were carried out to identify, the parameters accounting for the functional dissimilarity of these two tasks. The variables examined were: Display mode (pursuit versus compensatory), number of dimensions (one versus two), control law, and assignment of controls to limbs. While varying control law mixture had a relatively small effect on task intercorrelations, both variation in display mode and number of dimensions substantially reduced them. The effects of limb assignment were complex, though in general they showed that for two-dimensional tasks the important factor was whether control was carried out using a single limb rather than using separate limbs for each dimension. After practice, the actual control devices and limbs used were relatively less important. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1985,United Kingdom,Occupational and psychosocial stress among commercial aviation pilots,"<title>Occupational and psychosocial stress among commercial aviation pilots</title> <abstract>The sources of occupational and domestic stress, together with life events and coping strategies, were assessed in terms of their influence on job dissatisfaction, mental health, and performance among a group of 442 commercial airline pilots. It was found that self-perceived poor performance was associated with job-related factors such as fatigue and anxiety about required courses, performance checks, and insufficient flying time, particularly among older pilots. Job dissatisfaction was predicted by lack of career opportunities, poor organizational climate and morale, and lack of autonomy at work, together with some domestic stressors (e.g., family health). Overall mental ill-health was found to be associated with lack of autonomy at work, fatigue, and flying patterns, together with an inability to relax and a lack of social support. © 1985 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.</abstract>"

Errors were classified using a recently devised classification of motor-program errors (Reason 1979) and all the controllers were observed under three conditions of workload, and performing two ostensibly similar air-traffic tasks. More errors were found with increasing workload, but only in one of the tasks This was interpreted in terms of the pacing and time stress inherently imposed in that task. The assessment of error incidence seems a good candidate as a non-intrusive measure of workload. Analysis of errors in terms of Reason’s typology showed no interaction with any of the other variables. The association of errors with the use of particular pieces of equipment demonstrated ergonomic deficiencies which may have otherwise remained unnoticed It seems that error auditing may also be a useful investigative technique in ergonomic assessment. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

There is variance among patients in the amount of information they want to be told and variance among professionals in the amount of information they want to tell. Truth is conditioned by our knowledge limits and understanding. Technological advances in health care have made this arena even more complex. Placebos have been viewed traditionally as a kind of benign deception. Few studies have looked at treatments and tests as placebos. There are many myths associated with placebos and placebo therapy. There are five primary theories for withholding the truth or promoting deception with patients. Ethical and legal principles generally support veracity and the concept of a duty to tell the truth. One of the remaining issues is whether the placebo effect can be achieved without deception.</abstract>"

Those collected on aviators who were causally involved in their mishaps were compared with those who had no culpability in their mishaps. Those who were assigned pilot error demonstrated symptoms of having problems with interpersonal relationships, an indication of 'acting out' behavior. 'Acting out' would be a very typical reaction for the aggressive, non-introspective individual who is not coping with life stresses well. It is hypothesized that the pilot factor mishap might be a symptom of inadequate stress coping as well.</abstract>"

The automatic navigation systems reduced the number of navigation errors and the size of deviations from intended track. The Doppler system reduced the time devoted to navigating and the number of verbal navigation messages exchanged between the pilot and copilot. The projected map system reduced visual workload. However, with all three navigation systems, more than 80% of the copilots' time was spent on navigation tasks, less than 10% of their time was visual 'free time' that could be used for other tasks, and greater than 20% of the aircrew's time was occupied with navigation communications.</abstract>"

The results indicate that co-ordination problems are most likely when the workload is high. Deviation from standard operating procedures was also identified by the pilots as a major source of co-orrdination problems. Disputes on the flight deck were more likely if one crew member had an interaction style that was difficult to cope with, or was deviating from normal role behaviour, or held attitudes about the operation of the aircraft that differed significantly from other crew members. The data indicate that social psychological factors can have a strong influence on co-ordination behaviour and the variables which influence teamwork are discussed. © 1985.</abstract>"

1984,Canada,An investigation of the effectiveness of pilot judgment training,"<title>An investigation of the effectiveness of pilot judgment training</title> <abstract>Pilot decisional errors have always been a significant factor in aviation accidents. Pilot judgment, however, traditionally has been viewed as an intrinsic quality or a by-product of flying experience. Only recently has it been examined as a potential flight-training requirement. Over the past 10 years, initial steps have been taken in Canada and in the United States to validate the effectiveness of pilot judgment training. In this study, the judgment skills of Canadian civilian air cadets who received judgment training both in the classroom and in flight while earning a private pilot license were compared with the skills of a control group of cadets who received conventional training. The judgment skills of all subjects were measured during short, well-structured cross-country 'observation flights'. The results indicate that those subjects who had received judgment training averaged fewer decisional errors than did their counterparts who had received the standard training only. These results suggest that pilot judgment can be improved with training.</abstract>"

Input variables (e.g., task characteristics, reward structure, position power, stress levels) have been identified and related to the flightcrew process. There have been suggestions that leader and member personality profiles are important predictors of group process variables in the aviation environment. Levels of workload and stress have been found in work in high fidelity flight simulators to be characteristic of many accident scenarios. Because accidents are infrequent, the author maintains that they make terrible research criteria for judging crew performance. The issue is addressed in the context of altering group norms, increasing member effort and coordination, and changing group composition.

It is anomalous that, even though this masking influence is widely accepted, most studies of circadian rhythmicity have been performed in the presence of such interferences. A protocol is described, the constant routine, by which these exogenous influences can be minimized, thereby enabling a closer scrutiny of the internal clock(s) to be made. An account is given of the different circumstances in which the constant routines have been used together with the results derived from such studies. Briefly, they indicate that nychthemeral studies can give misleading information about the rate of adjustment of the internal clock to various manipulations, e.g. time-zone transition, shift work. In addition, future studies making use of constant routines are described, in particular those which might enable the presence of more than one internal clock to be established. © 1984 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.</abstract>"
1984,United States,The politics of stress: The case of air traffic control,"<title>The politics of stress: The case of air traffic control</title> <abstract>Analysis of the 1981 Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization strike suggests that workers who employ the concept of stress to describe undesirable job conditions risk unexpected negative consequences. In deciding not to make subjective claims that can only be addressed in political terms, workers necessarily appeal to outside experts to provide scientific, objective descriptions of job conditions. Unfortunately, different experts define stress in strikingly different ways, allowing for a kind of shell game in which the very existence of stress can become problematical. In addition, the stress experts have been unable to offer more than weak data to support the theories that link difficult working conditions to pathological outcomes. Thus workers are likely to lose labor disputes that depend on the stress discourse. A major reason for such an outcome is that job conditions, as part of the social world, lend themselves poorly to a form of inquiry designed to investigate the physical world.</abstract>"

The flight task was varied in difficulty by manipulation of the presentation rate and complexity of a hazard-perception task that required each of 48 licensed pilots to rely heavily on their perceptual abilities. Three rating scales (Modified Cooper-Harper, Multi-descriptor, and Workload- Compensation-Interference/Technical Effectiveness), two secondary task measures (time estimation and tapping regularity), one physiological measure (respiration frequency), and one primary task measure (danger-condition response time) were reliable indicants of workload changes.

1984,United States,Perceived threat and avoidance maneuvers in response to cockpit traffic displays,"<title>Perceived threat and avoidance maneuvers in response to cockpit traffic displays</title> <abstract>Airline pilots rated their perception of the danger of an air-to-air collision based on cockpit displays of traffic information while they monitored simulated departures. They selected avoidance maneuvers when necessary for separation. Most evasive maneuvers were turns rather than vertical maneuvers. Evasive maneuvers chosen for encounters with low- or moderate-collision danger were generally toward the intruding aircraft. This tendency lessened as the perceived threat level increased. In the highest threat situations, pilots turned toward the intruder only at chance levels. Intruders coming from positions in front of the pilot's ship were more frequently avoided by turns toward than when intruders approached laterally or from behind. Some of the implications of the pilots' turning-toward tendencies are discussed with respect to automatic collision avoidance systems and coordination of avoidance maneuvers of conflicting aircraft.</abstract>"

Rating scale measures were obtained immediately postflight; all others were taken over a 7-min segment of the flight task. The results indicated that both the Modified Cooper-Harper Scale and the workload Multi-descriptor Scale were sensitive to changes in communications load. The secondary-task measure of time estimation and the physiological measure of pupil diameter were also sensitive. As expected, those primary-task measures that were direct measures of communicative performance were also sensitive to load, whereas aircraft control primary-task measures were not, attesting to the task specificity of such measures. Finally, the intrusion analysis revealed no differential interference between workload measures.</abstract>"

An attack ususally lasts 10 min or less and ends spontaneously through external sensory stimulation, or by the intense efforts of the patient. Although it is usually described as part of the narcoleptic tetrad (with hypnogogic hallucinations, cataplexy, and sleep attacks) it can occur in isolated form (Roffwarg5). Rapid time-zone change ('jet-lag') syndrome results from a single rapid change of multiple times zones. It consists of fatigue, sleepiness, and subsequent mental consequences during the wake period and insomnia during the sleep period. The dyssynchrony that occurs between a person's new sleep-wake times and the once parallel clock hour sleep-wake times causes the syndrome, as the person attempts to keep the same clock hour schedule in the destination time zone. The following report describes isolated sleep paralysis in two people which may have resulted from a rapid time-zone shift ('jet-lag' syndrome). A neurophysiologic explanation for this association is then proposed.</abstract>"
1983,United States,The evolution and present status of mental health standards for selection of USAF candidates for space missions,"<title>The evolution and present status of mental health standards for selection of USAF candidates for space missions</title> <abstract>The mental health evaluation of the original Mercury astronauts was a prolonged, meticulous, research-oriented process involving testing and interviews to determine who was best qualified for space flight. The trend since then has been to simplify this evaluation, making it more subjective and clinically oriented. The goal is to identify candidates who are fully qualified, free of psychopathology, and who have a healthy motivation for space flight. The selection of nonpilots for duty as payload specialists introduces new factors - lack of previous exposure to dangerous situations, possible impact of new stresses on the family situation, and interrelationships between crew members. These factors can be included in determination of individual candidates as being 'fully qualified,' rather than returning to the original 'best qualified' standards, and affirmative qualities may be identified which mark candidates as 'exceptionally well qualified.' Validation of these evaluation procedures and criteria depends upon assessment of space crew members' performance on actual mission.</abstract>"

In professional aircrew, psychiatric disorders are commonly aviation-related, whilst in private pilots less effective selection and the stresses of business and personal affairs are common factors. Because human error is a major cause of accidents, the early diagnosis of disorders of thought and behaviour is clearly crucial in promoting flight safety. Airline doctors and AMEs must play the most important part.</abstract>"

Controllers also largely determine efficiency in the mass movement of aircraft on instrument plans. Individual and group controller health and well-being are essential to the sustained efficient and safe operation of these aircraft in the National Airspace System. Impairments of mental function due to illness, fatigue, drugs, excessive stress, alcohol or other factors are major threats to air safety. This paper covers certain identified factors regarding controller characteristics and health that bear upon the safety and efficiency of flight activities. Some possible remedies for specific problems are provided.</abstract>"
1983,United States,Assaults in the air: Concerning attacks against flight attendants,"<title>Assaults in the air: Concerning attacks against flight attendants</title> <abstract>Violence directed at airline personnel by passengers while an aircraft is in flight presents an interesting and uncommon form of deviant behavior that can inform the study of deviance in general. Such behavior has been identified by various observers as a growing social problem. This paper explores the phenomenon of assaults against flight attendants through analysis of official data including both case files and statistics, interviews with officials, and a multidisciplinary literature review. Specifically, we identify factors related to both the etiology of, and reactions toward such behavior. Factors related to etiology include (1) the physical environment of an aircraft; (2) the juxtaposition of status roles between passenger and attendant; (3) the exercise of authority as a precipitating event; (4) the pervasiveness of sexual stereotypes; (5) the consumption of alcohol and drugs; and (6) psychological changes related to the experience of flying. In examining the responses to assaults we discuss (1) the statutory laws regarding aircraft assaults; (2) patterns in official statistics; (3) factors related to the underreporting of such incidents; (4) reactions by companies, unions, and the government, including the politics of deviance‐defining; and (5) changes in patterns of response. Unlike common assaults, the offenders are almost exclusively middle‐ and upper‐class persons. Suggestions for further research are offered. © 1983 Hemisphere Publishing Corporation.</abstract>"
1983,Norway - Sweden,Anxiety and Coping Behavior During an Emergency Landing,"<title>Anxiety and Coping Behavior During an Emergency Landing</title> <abstract>A flight from London to New York (the Titanic itinerary), presenting a flight crash on one of the screens and a film about the Titanic on the other, suddenly had a fire on board. The captain intended to make an emergency landing on the water near the spot where the Titanic disappeared. The level of anxiety was high among passengers and even more so among the cabin crew members. What does a psychologist (on his way to a congress for the study of anxiety) do in such a situation? He does the only thing he knows well; he studies fellow passenger anxiety, and this becomes his own coping strategy. © 1983, SAGE PUBLICATIONS, INC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1983,United States,Psychological well-being in united states air force fliers,"<title>Psychological well-being in united states air force fliers</title> <abstract>Three dimensions of overall health are defined by the World Health Organization-physical, mental, and social. Psychological well-being has been a popular research topic recently and has been shown to relate to mental health. The analysis of distinct population groups offers unique opportunities for the investigation of the interplay of the psychological, social, and physical elements of health. This study characterizes the psychological wellbeing of a unique, high stress occupational group, United States Air Force fliers (pilots and navigators). Data were obtained from a cross-sectional “Health Survey” of male fliers and nonfliers with 2485 respondents. Mental health was ascertained with an index of psychological well-being (PWB). Additionally, other data relevant to health status were collected. Results of the Alameda County, California, survey of PWB were also used for comparison. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression. Fliers were found to have significantly better PWB than nonfliers; this finding is in accord with clinical folklore regarding differences between fliers and nonfliers. Both Air Force groups had better PWB than that reported for Alameda County. There were no significant differences between pilots and navigators and no differences between pilots of different types of aircraft, results which contradict previous anecdotal reports. Young (age 21 to 28) active pilots were found to be a distinct group with significantly better PWB than any other group. Several variables made small but statistically significant contributions to explaining the variance in PWB. The best correlates of PWB were better self-reported overall health, lack of perceived time pressure, more competitive behavior, and a positive attitude toward physical fitness. The results are discussed in terms of the flier selection process, the intrinsic differences in those who select flying as a vocation, and the interaction of the flier’s developmental stage and his environment. © 1983 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.</abstract>"

Testing included 2 min of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) at-40 torr (equivalent to +2Gz) after 118 min at 3,810 m chamber altitude and, after returning to ground level pressure, ergometry of 50 watts (W) for 6 min. The fast had no statistically significant effect on altitude and fatigue tolerances. One subject, who tolerated 2 min of LBNP in the nonfasting condition, lost useful consciousness during this test in the fasting condition. Although the remaining 10 subjects tolerated 2 min of LBNP in both fasting and nonfasting conditions without statistically significant differences in quantitated parameters, two of them during fasting manifested symptoms usually associated with impending syncope. Pilots should be informed that a 24-h fast may reduce the margin for safe tolerance of ≥+2Gz flight maneuvers.</abstract>"
1982,United States,Negative transfer: A threat to flying safety,"<title>Negative transfer: A threat to flying safety</title> <abstract>Negative transfer is defined in the context of this paper as the transfer from one cockpit to another - of different design or configuration - of habits or responses which were appropriate in the former but are inappropriate in the latter, thereby posing a threat to flying safety. This danger has been demonstrated not only experimentally but also in a number of aircraft accident investigation reports. As new aircraft become available to the commercial, military, and private sectors and pilots consequently must transition from older to newer models, the phenomenon of negative transfer becomes increasingly significant. To illustrate the concept of negative transfer and aviation, the author compares the cockpits of two USAF aircraft and how their differences could adversely affect pilot performance. Recommendations are then made on ways organizational flight surgeons can minimize the negative transfer threat to aviation.</abstract>"

The eye is lazy and resists the pull of a distant stimulus, preferring to rest at relatively short focal distance, as it does in the dark or when looking at the sky. Judgements of apparent size are highly correlated with visual accomodation distance, and the difficulty of detecting airplanes on stationary collision courses is greatly aggravated when focus is trapped by structures close to the eyes. Subject, cockpit design, task, and environmental variables all interact to determine what we think we see.</abstract>"

Monetary reward and curiosity were the main reasons for volunteering to participate in the research program. Fear and monetary reward not worth the risk were the main reasons for not volunteering to participate. The major reason for stopping participation in the acceleration research program was not because of volunteer subject-related reasons, but because of being asked to stop for medical reasons by the medical members of the research staff. This type of periodic motivational analysis serves a number of constructive purposes, including self review of human-use research practices and volunteer subject feedback which enhance methods for recruitment and retention of high quality volunteer subjects.</abstract>"
1982,United States,The influence of differential physical conditioning regimens on simulated aerial combat maneuvering tolerance,"<title>The influence of differential physical conditioning regimens on simulated aerial combat maneuvering tolerance</title> <abstract>The influence of physical conditioning on tolerance to a centrifugation profile called the Simulated Aerial Combat Maneuvering (SACM) was determined using 24 young men as subjects. These subjects were assigned to groups as controls (no physical training, C), runners (R), and weight trainers (W). They followed a 12-week protocol of specified physical training. During this study, tolerance to the SACM, maximum oxygen consumption, muscle strength, and body composition were periodically determined. SACM tolerance was defined as the total time that a subject could withstand continuous exposure to a 4.5 and 7.0 +G(z) centrifugation profile as determined by his voluntary endpoint of fatigue. The +G(z) tolerance of the runners and controls increased at an average rate of 4 s/week during the course of the experiment. On the other hand, the weight trainers increased their G tolerance at an average rate of 15 s/week. The difference between group W compared with groups C and R was statistically significant at the 5% level. Fatigue scores indicate that group W subjects take longer to reach a given level of fatigue than did the subjects of the other groups. It appears therefore that a physical conditioning program of weight training will improve human tolerance to aerial combat maneuvers.</abstract>"

This type of change is then related to the jet-lag-by-time-zone myth.</abstract>"

A 'paper and pencil' simulation was used to frame the situation into which pilots interjected their own decision-making skills in a simple ranking of candidate diversion airports with varying locational, navigational aid, radar, and weather attributes. Using the conjoint measurement technique, attribute worth functions of 30 pilots were constructed. Systematic differences in the worth functions of the pilots were not found as a result of dividing the pilot sample according to any measure of flight hours' experience. However, differences were found when the pilot sample was grouped according to grade of pilot certificate, type of pilot training, and type of flying most commonly done.</abstract>"

The results showed that the males were much faster in attaining the criterion level of performance on the flight tasks, and that some of the sex differences in the acquisition of task skills can be reduced by means of pretraining on specific cognitive and motor skills. In the prediction of trials to criterion (acquisition rate) of both the basic and the complex flight maneuvers, individually tailoring the regression equations by sex - as opposed to utilizing general overall regression equations - greatly enhanced the predictive capability.</abstract>"

The model is used to examine current aircrew training and to develop new training strategies for improving judgement performance.</abstract>"
1982,United States,Functional optical invariants: A new methodology for aviation research,"<title>Functional optical invariants: A new methodology for aviation research</title> <abstract>The application to aviation physiology of Gibson's 'ecological approach to visual perception' demands information-rich visual displays to adequately and unambiguously enable a pilot to perform flight maneuvers. Optical information often takes the form of invariant properties of a changing optic array, and functional invariants are defined as psychologically effective optical invariants. Their effectiveness is determined by empirical test, but standard experimental paradigms are shown to be inappropriate for testing the effectiveness of information-rich displays. This is due to the presence of inherent and unavoidable confounding factors that are here termed 'secondary independent variables' in contradistinction in the 'primary independent variables' manipulated by the experimenter. Recommendations for a new methodology and statistical treatment are offered, and the implications for aviation psychology are discussed.</abstract>"
1982,United States,Towards an internal model in pilot training,"<title>Towards an internal model in pilot training</title> <abstract>Optimal decision making requires an information seeking behavior which reflects the comprehension of the overall system dynamics. Research in the area of human monitors in man-machine systems supports the notion of an internal model with built-in experiences. It is doubtful that the current approach to pilot training helps develop this internal model in the most efficient way. But this is crucial since the role of the pilot is changing to systems' manager and decision maker. An extension of the behavioral framework of pilot training might help to prepare the pilot better for the increasingly complex flight environment. This extension is based on the theoretical model of schema theory, which evolved out of psychological research. The technological advances in aircraft simulators and in-flight performance measurement devices allow investigation of the still-unresolved issues.</abstract>"

Associations between enumerated operator errors and several objective indicators of crew coordination were investigated. The correspondence among high operator error counts and infrequent compliance with specific crew coordination requirements was most notable when copilots were accountable for control of flight parameters.</abstract>"

Possible underlying reasons for this relationship are discussed. Both samples were more Stable than the general population at the beginning of their training. In addition, there is evidence for positive correlations with success in training for both Stability and Extraversion. As EPI scores are independent of existing selection test scores, improvements in the prediction of success might be achieved if they were taken into account. However, ‘faking‐good’ may be a problem. 1982 The British Psychological Society</abstract>"

Four experiments are reported from a programme of research aimed at the development and application of methodologies for assessing factors relevant to keyboard design. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the effects of various aircrew gloves on a representative aircraft data entry task are highly situation specific. Experiment 2 showed that gloves impaired performance on a high compatibility continuous keying task, with relatively high keying rates, and that this impairment was not reduced by additional auditory feedback. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the high compatibility keying task provided a successful methodology for investigating the effects of key displacement and resistance on speed and accuracy. Experiment 4 indicated the relative contributions of reduced tactility and mobility to the effects on keying and manipulative performance caused by aircrew gloves. Together, these experiments suggest that kinaesthetic and tactile Feedback associated with keying are relatively unaffected by aircrew gloves, and that restrictions on mobility caused by gloves may be more important for continuous data entry involving relatively high keying rates. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1982,United States,Conditioned feeding suppression in rats produced by cross-coupled and simple motions,"<title>Conditioned feeding suppression in rats produced by cross-coupled and simple motions</title> <abstract>Conditioned feeding suppression was produced in rats by earth-vertical rotation, seesaw acceleration, and cross-coupled accelerations. Rats were exposed to 15 min of motion immediately after eating a sweet, novel food. The effects of this motion were assessed by measuring consumption of sweet food during a second feeding session that was 72 hr after exposure to motion. Exposure to cross-coupled accelerations produced the greatest conditioned suppression of feeding. Progressively less suppression resulted from exposure to seesaw acceleration and to rotation. This ordering of suppression effects is consistent with the amount of vestibular stimulation produced by these motions. These results indicate that conditioned feeding suppression in rats can be produced by vestibular stimulation of a duration known to produce frank motion sickness in other animals and man.</abstract>"

Because 'life change' is found to be a contributing factor to stress and development of illness in both civilian and military populations, the study of life change events in aviators is a reasonable point from which to begin. The Holmes and Rahe Recent Life Change Questionnaire was administered to an experimental group of 158 aviators and two control groups: one group of 127 ground crew who were matched for age and location, and a group of 46 who were matched for rank. Significant differences were found between some of the subgroups but there were no significant differences between the experimental group and either of the control groups, Nonetheless, this aviator population is functioning at a level of life change-induced stress which would normally predict health changes in 50% of the general population. Therefore, it is concluded, the effect of excessive life change as a contributing factor to personal stress and illness or accident merits further study.</abstract>"

NASA has at the moment proposed a combination of promethazine and ephedrine ( P E) and one of scopolamine and dextroamphetamine ( S D), both given orally, as well as a transdermally applied scopolamine (TAS), as preventive and ameliorative measures. The reported double-blind study tests the early phase actions and efficacy of the transdermal scopolamine (Transderm ™-V of ALZA Corporation) and compares these in detail to the oral medications. Motion sickness resistance was tested by standardized head movements while accelerating at 0.2°/sec2 to a maximum rotation of 240°/sec, with an intermediate plateau of 10 min at 180°/sec. To permit weighting motion sickness protection against other system influences, cardiovascular, psychological (subjective and objective), and visual parameter changes were documented for the three therapeutic modes. The relative impact of the various modalities on operational and experimental components of space missions is discussed.

It was discovered that these two equally noise-exposed groups could be differentiated according to their smoking history and eye color. That is, the impaired hearing group reported smoking more cigarettes for a greater period of time that did the members of the normal hearing group. Furthermore, blue-eyed individuals were over-represented in the impaired hearing group and under-represented in the normal hearing group, whereas the reverse was true for brown-eyed aviators. This latter finding is consistent with reports linking temporary hearing loss and eye color. There were 31 other physical, psychological, and sociological measures which failed to appear differentially in the two groups.</abstract>"

1981,Canada,The psychosocial impact of a labour dispute,"<title>The psychosocial impact of a labour dispute</title> <abstract>As a by‐product of a larger investigation, this paper examines the psychosocial impact of a 1976 labour dispute among Canadian air traffic controllers. Questionnaires were administered to the controllers during the dispute and during two subsequent periods of routine operations, four and 10 months later. The level of distress, as measured by the 30‐item General Health Questionnaire, was significantly higher during the dispute than during routine operations. The labour dispute was also accompanied by deterioration in perceived general functioning, perceived health and perceived anxiety. However, no increase in use of medical services was documented in the two‐month period surrounding the dispute. Nor did the findings demonstrate any direct causal relationship between the salient issue of the dispute (i.e. the implementation of bilingual air communication in parts of Canada) and the increase in distress level during the dispute. Implications for the focus of future research in the field of labour disputes are discussed. 1981 The British Psychological Society</abstract>"

1981,France,Application of signal detection theory to decision making in supervisory control the effect of the operators experience,"<title>Application of signal detection theory to decision making in supervisory control the effect of the operators experience</title> <abstract>Signal detection theory (SDT) was used as a model for a supervisory activity: The decisions of the air-traffic controller using radar. Of particular interest was the 'professional-experience factor which was studied by comparing the performance of trainee and experienced controllers. Through a distinction allowed by SOT between information processing and the decision process (13), it was shown that trainees discriminate better than experienced controllers, but that the latter manifest a greater degree of caution. These results are interpreted in terms of different information processing methods (judgement versus calculation) and different evaluations of the costs of possible outcomes. The practical interest of these results is demonstrated both for the evaluation of an operator aiding computer system and for methods of training. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (SAM) Airsick Rehabilitation Program requires careful selection to insure high motivation and thorough medical screening to rule out intercurrent medically disqualifying conditions. Patients are trained in relaxation techniques and placed in a modified Barany chair, capable of tilting as well as rotating. Psychological responses to motion stimulation are constantly monitored by both patient and investigators. Motion sickness is provoked, which the patient learns to control and abort through exercising autonomic control. Of 19 eligible, 16 have returned to full flying duties.</abstract>"

When viewed separately, these reports suggest specific patterns. When looked at collectively, psychiatric disorders in military aviators follow no specific pattern. A 5-year review of psychiatric evaluations done at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine reveals a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses. Although aviators with psychiatric disabilities are seldom seen, a greater proportion of this group will be grounded compared to other medical referrals. In selected cases, psychiatric treatment is highly successful. In future work, greater emphasis should be given to the identification of life stress events for the purpose of deterrence, in addition to rehabilitation through treatment.</abstract>"
1981,United Kingdom,Identification of features associated with flying phobia in aircrew,"<title>Identification of features associated with flying phobia in aircrew</title> <abstract>The psychological and physiological features of 20 aircrew consecutively referred for treatment of anxiety symptoms when flying were compared with a matched control group of uncomplaining aircrew. There were no significant differences between the two groups on psychometric tests of personality, though there were differences in skin conductance; the phobics had a higher rate of spontaneous fluctuation, and habituated less to a repeated auditory tone. More of the phobic group worried about their wives and acknowledged childhood and other adulthood phobias; more had a family history of an episode perhaps best described as flying trauma. Many were on an overseas posting when symptoms presented. These few features could correctly classify 85% of the subjects into the phobic or control group. This type of 'phobic aircrew index' now requires to be validated prospectively for its predictive value.</abstract>"
1981,Russian Federation,Informational need of emotional stress,"<title>Informational need of emotional stress</title> <abstract>According to the informational theory of emotions[1], emotions in humans depend on the power of some need (motivation) and the estimation by the subject of the probability (possibility) of the need staisfaction (the goal achievement). Low probability of need satisfaction leads to negative emotions, actively minimized by the subject. Increased probability of satisfaction, as compared to earlier forecast, generates positive emotions, which the subject tries to maximize, i.e. to enhance, to prolong, to repeat. The informational theory of emotions encompasses their reflective function, the laws of their appearance, the regulatory significance of emotions, and their role in organization of behavior. The level of emotional stress influences the operator's performance. A decrease in the emotional tonus leads to drowsiness, lack of vigilance, missing of significant signals and to slower reactions. An extremely high stress level disorganizes the activity, complicates it with a trend toward incorrect actions and reactions to insignificant signals (false alarms). The neurophysiological mechanisms of the influence of emotions on perceptual activity and operator performance as well as the significance of individuality are discussed. © 1981.</abstract>"
1981,Germany,Nausogenic properties of various dynamic and static force environments,"<title>Nausogenic properties of various dynamic and static force environments</title> <abstract>Motion sickness can occur when an accelerating force acting on the human body repeatedly changes amplitude and direction or both. It also can occur without any motion after transfer into a constant force field significantly different from Earth-gravity. Dynamic and static causes of motion sickness can be distinguished accordingly. Space sickness, too, has dynamic as well as static aspects. Dynamic space sickness might depend on increased bilateral differential sensitivity of the peripheral and central vestibular apparatus, whereas static space sickness may be caused by erroneous compensation of bilaterial asymmetries of the otolith-system in the microgravity environment. Experiments in airplanes, cars and on a vestibular sled have shown that the susceptibility to motion sickness is highest for changes of acceleration in the negative X-axis (as compared to the other axes) of the body. During reciprocating linear accelerations on the vestibular sled, standstill periods of movement and the direction of movement cannot correctly be indicated, because the peripheral vestibular apparatus lacks true motion detectors. © 1981.</abstract>"
1980,United States,Catecholamine excretion in A-10 pilots,"<title>Catecholamine excretion in A-10 pilots</title> <abstract>Catecholamine excretion was determined for 15 USAF pilots during surface attack training in the A-10 aircraft. Timed urine samples were used to determine excretion rates of epinephrine and norepinephrine during basal conditions, during five sorties performed in high-realism simulators, and during six actual flights. Catecholamine excretion was significantly elevated (p<0.05) over basal rates during all 11 training sorties; therefore, it was concluded that A-10 conversion and surface attack training results in a significant stress response in the subjects. The stress response experienced in the simulator diminished across trials; the stress response from aircraft flights remained steady through all sorties monitored. The relative proportions of epinephrine and norepinephrine remained similar across all but the final sorties in both the simulator and the aircraft. These occasions were typified by increased norepinephrine and decreased epinephrine excretion rates.</abstract>"

The five experimental tests and the five tests presently used by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for selecting ATCS trainees were employed in an iterative stepwise regression (stepdown procedure). The tests that made a significant contribution in predicting Academy scores were then used to form a composite and the old test battery and the new battery were compared. The new composite demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the multiple correlation over the old test battery. Use of the new test battery could result in a savings to the FAA in terms of Academy attrition due to failures. It could also aid in upgrading the quality of ATCS selectees and aid in minimizing human error in air traffic control work.</abstract>"

To ascertain whether that pattern of change suggested increased risk is characteristic of cadets at military academies, a similar study on a smaller scale was conducted on U.S. Air Force Academy cadets beginning in 1972. Randomly selected cadets were monitored throughout their 4-year training at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Mean levels of serum cholesterol were similar at the beginning and end of the study; values between those times were generally somewhat lower. Average body fat never exceeded 12.6%; the average remained close to 12% during the last 3 years. Possible reasons for the differences between the pattern of change in serum cholesterol in the West Point cadets in earlier years (1952-56) and in the U.S. Air Force Academy cadets are discussed. Differences in exercise or stress levels were ruled out as likely explanations. Changes in dietary fat intake may account for the differences, while unidentified changes in the social environment are possible contributory factors.</abstract>"

Current levels of air traffic are already pressing the capacity of todays's system. Future traffic is predicted to increase significantly, but economic and other factors place severe limits on the numbers of airports and runways that can be built. Resultant traffic congestion and controller work load, despite automation efforts, could increase the error rate and degrade the system's tolerance for errors. Several ATC-related aircraft accidents are summarized to illustrate the controller's changing role and the manner in which the controller interacts with pilots, other controllers, and the world environment.

Unusually high information-processing demands are placed upon controllers for extended periods of time, so that they often must work close to the limits of their channel capacity. The effort required to process information, maintain continuous concentration, and render timely and reasonable decisions is likely to be very stressful. Although stress-related performance decrements would not be acceptable in the typical air traffic control situation, the effects of stress may manifest themselves in social and family relationships and in physical and mental health. It is possible that laboratory measures of information processing (such as the delayed digit recall subsidiary task) could be used to evaluate reserve capacity and thereby predict the ability to cope with stress.

The premise is that accidents result from an imbalance between performance ability and performance demand. Advances in decreasing pilot-induced accidents must come from methods that will prevent the stresses that diminish performance ability. It is suggested that the investigation of life change as a contributing factor in aircraft accidents will be fruitful because of the tremendous amount of research that has already been done in this field. A review of previous work leads to three recommendations: the Recent Life Change Questionnaire (RLCQ) should be developed as a tool for management and individual aircrew; a character assurance program should be adopted; and a technique to remove accident-prone individuals should be developed.</abstract>

Individuals who suffer such reactions are rapidly retired for medical reasons from air traffic control work. Removal from control work generally results in a rapid abatement of the symptoms. However, it is also accompanied by a loss of initiative to return to work. Under the Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA). air traffic controllers who are medically retired with fob related disabilities and who suffer a complete loss of earning capacity are entitled to two-thirds to three-quarters of their pay, tax free. Present procedures for disability determination seem to be naive and vulnerable to the charge of malingering and fraud, while at the same time stigmatizing those traffic controllers who are genuinely in need of disability income. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Results were analyzed to determine long-term consequences of the war imprisonment experience. We hypothesized that individuals experiencing the greatest stress and frustration might believe they gained more psychologically than those less stressed. The questionnaire results indicated a distinct subgroup of POWs for which this was particularly true, although the subjective sense of feeling somehow “benefited” by the experience was by no means universal. This study supports the hypothesis that the subjective sense of having benefited from the experience of war imprisonment is positively correlated with the harshness of the experience. © 1980, American Medical Association.

Two measures were obtained: 1) an assessment of the usefulness of particular psychiatric skills and knowledge in the practice of aerospace medicine, and 2) a rating of the clinician's abilities in these areas. Results support the primary importance of interviewing and diagnostic skills.

1979,Japan,Frequency analysis of heart rate variability under flight conditions,"<title>Frequency analysis of heart rate variability under flight conditions</title> <abstract>The factors causing heart rate variability (HRV) were investigated under various kinds of workloads and flight conditions. Frequency analysis of heart rate, and cross-correlation analysis with blood pressure and respiration, were performed by using the fast Fourier analyser. Consequently, the main frequency of HRV at rest consisted of 0.1 Hz and 0.25-0.3 Hz. These fluctuations disappeared under physical loads, but the value of 0.1 Hz at first increased under moderate mental load and thereafter decreased as the mental load increased. It was suggested that the behavior of the frequency 0.1 Hz under mental load was influenced partly by higher brain centers. For the actual flight, the frequency decreased under takeoff and landing, and remained as at rest during the gunnery and acrobatic training flight. It was concluded that the evaluation of workloads under flight conditions by using the analysis of the factors of HRV was very useful to improve a man-machine interface.</abstract>"

Expanded roles, as well as advances in knowledge and technology have prepared nurses for critical, specialized, primary, aerospace, and independent nursing practice. Exciting as they are, nursing's expanded roles and practices frequently contribute to the burnout and distress phenomena increasingly observed in practicing health care professionals. Causes and symptoms of the burnout distress phenomena are many and varied. Rather than utilizing crisis intervention coping techniques, preventive strategies and adaptations are suggested. This paper reviews and discusses: factors associated with burnout-distress phenomena identified in professional literature; identification of factors associated with expanded roles and practice which contribute to burnout stress; identification of factors in military and civilian air ambulance and aeromedical evacuation systems which contribute to burnout stress; and recommendations for strategies to prevent and cope with burnout distress factors.</abstract>"
1979,United States,Psychosocial modifiers of response to stress,"<title>Psychosocial modifiers of response to stress</title> <abstract>The impact of stress upon an organism is far more complex than the simple design of most stress research implies. We offer an expanded model for studying the relation of stressors to pathological outcomes, which takes into account both the adaptive capacity of the organism before the stressor occurs and the defenses marshalled in response to the stressor. The model also distinguishes among the initial responses of alarm, sustained defensive behaviors, and the relatively irreversible end- states which remain after resistance has ended. Realizing that only a multidisciplinary approach can begin to capture the wholeness of human experience, this research paradigm anticipates that stressors, adaptive capacities, defenses, alarm reactions, and pathological end-states will take place at the biological, psychological, interpersonal and sociocultural levels simultaneously and successively. Data on life change stress and psychological health outcomes gathered as part of the Air Traffic Controller Health Change Study are analyzed to illustrate the use of the model in identifying psychosocial and biological modifiers of response to stress. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

1979,United States,Behavioral and psychological effects of microwave radiation,"<title>Behavioral and psychological effects of microwave radiation</title> <abstract>The first category of behavioral reaction to microwaves and other radiofrequency electromagnetic radiations involves responses confirmed in laboratory experiments from which a dose-response picture indicates absence of damaging effects of acute exposures (typically less than 60 minutes) at whole-body energy-dose rates below 3 mW/g. To result in this dose rate, the power density of incident radiation could be as low as 2 to 3 mW/cm2 for a small animal but would be on the order of 15 to 20 mW/cm2 for a human being. The second category treats of behavioral sequelae of indeterminate origin observed during epidemiological studies of industrial and military populations. Because of the general lack of quantitative information on intensity of ambient radiofrequency fields and because of myriad uncontrolled variables in the mundane environment, the extant epidemiological findings are the best hypotheses in need of experimental verification. The third category is that of imagined effects of radiofrequency radiations at power densities so low as to fall below the human body's rate of emitting microwave energy. Examples cited are the belief that video-display terminals emit significant quantities of microwave energy and the thesis that airline pilots have a higher than normal probability of fathering mongoloid children because of excessive exposure to microwaves. Because chronic anxiety can produce systemic disruption, propagators of imaginary hazards of microwave radiation probably generate more stress and disease in suggestible populations than the low-intensity fields to which all manner of ills are attributed.</abstract>"

1979,United States,On the Evaluation of Training Devices,"<title>On the Evaluation of Training Devices</title> <abstract>The theme of the paper is ways of evaluating flight simulators for aircrew training. The transfer of training experiment and the rating method are the two present-day ways of evaluating the worth of a simulator. The transfer experiment requires the trainee to practice in the simulator and then be tested in the parent aircraft to demonstrate the training value of the simulator. The rating method requires the pilot to be experienced in the parent aircraft and to rate the simulator for similarity to the aircraft. If similarity is high, the training value is assumed to be high. Arguments are presented that both of these methods are flawed. It is contended that a simulator, or any other system, need not necessarily be tested if it is based on reliable scientific laws and the success of other systems, based on the same laws, has been high. Good laws produce accurate prediction, and when outcome can be predicted it is redundant to conduct a system evaluation. With uncertainty about laws, the requirement for system testing increases. The psychological principles underlying simulators are reviewed. © 1979, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

As expected from prior short-term memory research, two major determinants of error probability were (1) amount of information that the pilot has to process in a given time and (2) retention interval between the time information is transmitted from the controller and the time it is acted on (recalled) by the pilot. Additionally, the manner of encoding numerical information was varied. The result of this manipulation indicated that, as suggested by recent research in cognitive psychology, the current information-encoding scheme has substantial room for improvement in terms of minimizing memory failure. © 1978, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

The morbidity experience of air traffic controllers does not appear excessive, except for psychoneurotic disorders, compared with the experience of other outside groups studies. Additionally, a lack of association between disease occurrence and occupation is observed in the data correlation disease occurrence with length of service and age. While some isolated trends found in these data are supportive of an occupation/disease relationship, they are neither - as would expected if the association were a strong one - impressive nor consistent. Although anticipated empirically, one of the more interesting results of the study was quantifaction of the substantial differences found to exist in the incidence of disease before and after the second-career legislation.</abstract>"

The authors argue that syncope in aircrew should be considered from a psychosocial perspective as well as from a medical-neurological perspective. © 1979 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.</abstract>"
1978,,Sensorial aspects of helicopter operations,"<title>Sensorial aspects of helicopter operations</title> <abstract>As components of physical and psychic workload in the piloting of helicopters, and therefore as possible concurrent pathogenetic factors of operational fatigue in helicopter aircrews, the author examines and analyzes the effects of some sensorial phenomena related to the use of such rotor-powered aircraft. Particularly acoustic and non-acoustic vibrations associated with flying this type of vehicle are discussed as to their action not only on the auditory apparatus, but also on the function of other apparatuses of the central nervous system, with special reference to the effects exerted by vibratory motions on visual function. Another problem taken into consideration is the disorientation that, particularly during helicopter flights, the pilot may experience whenever there is a conflict between his own sensorial evaluations and the information supplied by the instruments. In helicopter operations this problem becomes far more serious than in the case of conventional fixed-wing aircraft, since accelerations may occur simultaneously along all three of the aerodynamic axes of the vehicle, so that it is possible for the pilot to experience more frequently environmental and coenesthetic situations that are ambiguous from both the visual and vestibular standpoints: this may sometimes produce flight accidents. Finally the author examines the means that might be employed for the purpose of ascertaining and identifying functional changes and possibly preventing negative effects produced by the above-mentioned sensorial phenomena, in order to attain a higher degree of flight safety in helicopter operations as a result of the prevention of flight accidents due to the human factor.</abstract>"
1978,Japan,Evaluation method of mental workload under flight conditions,"<title>Evaluation method of mental workload under flight conditions</title> <abstract>In order to analyze the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and the flight tasks of pilots, HRV of various mental and physical work stresses were investigated. For the physical stress on the treadmill, S.D. of heart rate sequence showed a minimum value at medium stresses and remained there until the maximum stress. However, the centrifuge acceleration test presupposed special physical stresses, and S.D. was almost same as the resting findings. In the tracking tasks, which presupposed maximum interpretative actions, the S.D. increased a greater amount than for resting results. Consequently, preflight checks and level flight phases presuppossed medium interpretative actions and mental stress with reserve capacity. Takeoff and landing phases were considered as both high interpretative action and high emotional stress situations. Acrobatic and gunnery training flight phases were considered physical load, strong interpretative actions, and emotional stress tasks.</abstract>"

Review of the pilot's history reflected a perfectionist attitude since childhood with continuous associated near-serious accidents. Flight training revealed occurrences of over-correction, channelized attention, and denial of errors. With the demands of Naval Aviation that spurs the growth of the perfectionist, normal/abnormal parameters of obsession-compulsion as they present themselves must be cautiously examined.</abstract>"
1978,United States,Comparison of the vigilance performance of men and women using a simulated radar task,"<title>Comparison of the vigilance performance of men and women using a simulated radar task</title> <abstract>The present study examined the question of possible sex differences in the ability to sustain attention to a complex monitoring task requiring only a detection response to critical stimulus changes. The visual display was designed to approximate a futuristic, highly automated air traffic control radar display containing computer-generated alphanumeric symbols. There were 26 men and 26 women tested, each over a 2-h session. Sixteen targets appeared on the screen at all times, with 10 signals (a designated change in the alphanumerics) randomly presented during each 0.5 h of the test session. Detection latency to the signals increased significantly during the session, but there was no evidence of any significant differences between the sexes in the magnitude or pattern of this increase. The results are discussed in terms of a general decline in alertness that was apparently equal for both sexes.</abstract>"
1978,United Kingdom,Workload and fatigue - in-flight EEG changes,"<title>Workload and fatigue - in-flight EEG changes</title> <abstract>Continuous recordings were made of the EEG and ECG of one pilot during a series of instrument flights in a feeder-type transport aircraft. The flights were arranged to contain epochs of distinctly differing levels of workload. In addition, some flights were made after a night of sleep deprivation and others were made as the second and third flights of the day. Subjectively, there appeared to be marked differences in performance between the two types of tired flight. The EEG analyses showed changes that correlated well with differences in workload. In the highest workload areas during fresh flights, EEG activity increased by approximately a factor of 4 over that of the preflight resting values. This large increase did not occur in the tired flights. Further experiments are planned using flights in aircraft and in simulators using several subjects.</abstract>"
1978,United States,Use of path models to study a precareer air traffic control training program,"<title>Use of path models to study a precareer air traffic control training program</title> <abstract>Past studies have demonstrated that women and minorities are less likely to be selected as FAA air traffic controllers than are nonminority men and, when selected, are less likely to be successful. One major reason for this is that women and minorities have less aviation-related background experience. In response to this need the '150' Predevelopmental program was begun to give those selected for the program a 1-year orientation to aviation and air traffic control prior to FAA Academy training. The purpose of this research was to study the unique relationship between Predevelopmental training and Academy success. Since random selection and/or assignment of subjects to the Predevelopmental program is not feasible and a matching control group was not available, traditional research methods and statistical analyses were not appropriate. Consequently, path analysis was employed where derived significant relationships were considered simultaneously to determine the unique relationship between Predevelopment training and Academy success. The path models indicated that Predevelopmental training overall does significantly enhance a trainee's potential for Academy success with a possible differential effect according to minority status. This study demonstrates that path models can be used to considerable utility in assessing special aviation-related training programs.</abstract>"

Of the 800 survivors of World War II and the Korean conflict, 95 were found to have died from nonmilitary causes over this followup period. This is markedly less than the 208 that would be expected from a random sample of white American men over a similar period (p<0.005). It is also significantly less than the 143 that would have been expected from a group of men who had passed an initial insurance physical (p<0.005). Lower-than-expected death rates occurred in all three major categories of cause of death in this age group: cardiovascular, neoplastic, and accidental. The generally good socioeconomic background, the positive genetic influence of long-lived parents, the above average intelligence, and the health and fitness of the military aviator are all thought to be factors contributing to this increased longevity.</abstract>"

All trainees completed the nonradar laboratory portion of the training and, in addition, completed a preemployment questionnaire. Based on responses to the questionnaire, the trainees were assigned to one of three experience groups, corresponding to groups given credit for experience using Civil Service Commission (CSC) selection procedures. It was found that the OKT was highly correlated with experience (r=0.64) and, in addition, had a higher correlation with successful completion of the nonradar lab than did experience (r = 0.25 vs. 0.12). It was determined that use of an OKT score of 75 or above to assign extra credit would result in a failure rate of 3.1% for those receiving credit, while use of the current experience scale would result in a failure rate of 7.6% for those receiving extra credit on the CSC selection battery. The results held up for a cross-validation sample of 432 trainees who entered the Academy during 1977. Based on the results, it is recommended that an OKT score of 75 or above be used to assign extra credit for experience in the selection of air traffic controllers.</abstract>"

1978,United States,Task-specific simulator pretraining and in-flight stress of student pilots,"<title>Task-specific simulator pretraining and in-flight stress of student pilots</title> <abstract>Student pilots (n = 20) were assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received 80 min of highfidelity, task-specific simulation prior to exposure to the initial power-on stall and spin recovery lesson unit in T-37 pilot training. Both experimental and control groups received orientation simulator experience not related to the aircraft spin series. Catecholamine excretion patterns indicated that the initial power-on stall and spin recovery lesson unit resulted in a pronounced stress response in both groups. A statistically significant difference in the norepinephrine/epinephrine ratio was found to exist between the experimental and control groups. It was concluded that task specific simulator pretraining resulted in an altered stress response characterized by lower arousal and greater mental work than was evidenced in the control group.</abstract>"

The average monthly prevalence of depression was 9.1%, with 7.0% at the symptom level, 1.9% at a level comparable to outpatients, and 0.2% with moderately severe levels. These figures were generally similar to those for other reported population groups, although exact comparisons were difficult because of the preselection for health in this population. Two patterns of depression were observed. One was characterized by an acute, episodic symptomatology returning to nonsymptomatic levels for most of the year, similar to Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) category “episodic minor depressive disorder.” The other showed a chronic, fluctuating course with significant depressive symptomatology over half the year, similar to RDC category “chronic and intermittent minor depressive disorder.,” © 1978, American Medical Association.

1978,United States,"Objective job difficulty, behavioural response, and sector characteristics in air route traffic control centres","<title>Objective job difficulty, behavioural response, and sector characteristics in air route traffic control centres</title> <abstract>Two thousand observations on 47 radar sectors in Boston and New York were used to determine the principal behavioural stressors in the air traffic control environment. Predictor variables included peak traffic. mean airspeed, sector area, sector type, radio-communication time, and theoretically derived control load factors. Expert observers rated the degree of activity and behavioural arousal of ATCs working the 47 radar sectors at the same time the objective measures were made. These ‘pace’ ratings were signficantly related to peak traffic count and duration of radio-communications. The control load factors were not related to behavioural responses. Statistical analyses indicated several refinements for the definition and measurement of the control load factors. For example, airspace control load was reliably estimated by sector type and number of transitioning planes, while co-ordination control load was most appropriately estimated by duration of radio-communications ' These results suggested that estimations of workload may be made by a relatively few objective measures, and that at least one estimate of individual’s behavioural responses, i.e. pace ratings, can be predicted by peak traffic counts. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1978,United States,Objective Workload and Behavioural Response in Airport Radar Control Rooms,"<title>Objective Workload and Behavioural Response in Airport Radar Control Rooms</title> <abstract>Previous research indicated that peak traffic and the duration of radio-communications were good predictors of behavioural response of air traffic controllers working in air route traffic control centres. In this study we investigated if these two measures of workload were generalisable to controllers (ATCs) working in radar facilities serving major airports. 3,110 observations were made on radar sectors at the 13 major radar control rooms in the U.S.A. A large number of air traffic variables and communication tasks were measured. Behavioural ratings were made by expert-observer ATC's. The results replicated previous findings that peak traffic and the duration of radio-communications functioned as behavioural stressors. Time monitoring and stand-by time also were found to predict behavioural responses. Careful consideration of these and other results led to the conclusion that peak traffic is the most generalisable environmental stressor for ATC's behaviour whereas the other workload measures are more correctly viewed as concomitants of the demand characteristics of ATC work. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1978,France,The regulation of working methods as a function of work-load among air traffic controllers,"<title>The regulation of working methods as a function of work-load among air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>A series of field studies among air traffic controllers is reviewed. It largely concentrated on regulatory aspects of operational behaviour, using a model based on the concept of ‘ economy ’ in the individual’s selection of operating procedures. Attention is directed at processes involving reasoning, the receipt and transmission of information, and the division of tasks between controllers at the same station. The basic hypothesis, which is supported by numerous data, is that for a given task and a given controller certain operating procedures are less costly than others; that is, they generate lower levels of load. These procedures will therefore be more and more employed as work demand increases, together with the relaxation of certain, self-imposed, qualitative criteria. This regulatory feedback between work-load and operating methods is used by the controller to avoid the abrupt onset of overload conditions and to delay satiation. For the investigator, these progressive changes in operating procedure can provide indirect indices of load. Several ergonomic consequences of this approach for system design are discussed. © 1978 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1978,United States,Physiological and psychological effects of heat stress simulating cockpit conditions,"<title>Physiological and psychological effects of heat stress simulating cockpit conditions</title> <abstract>It is generally accepted that physiologically tolerable heat stress can adversely affect human performance, but it is difficult to predict the impact of a specific environment. Experiments were designed to determine the effects of thermal conditions similar to those occurring in aircraft cockpits in warm climates, where both high air temperatures and radiant heat play important roles. Subjects (n=13) were exposed to heat for 2 h, had a 30-min break, then repeated the exposure. Conditions were T(db)=35°C and T(wb)=26°C, with or without use of infrared lamps which raised globe temperature to 47°C. Measurements included skin, rectal, and esophageal temperatures, heart rate, weight loss, and hematocrit. Subjective Fatigue Estimates (SFE) and Repetitive Psychometric Measures (RPM) were performed before, during, and after each heat stress. Both thermal conditions were physiologically compensable but induced marked subjective fatigue and altered the learning curve for some subtests of the RPM. Similar conditions in aircraft can be associated with impaired performance, particularly in new or emergency situations.</abstract>"

1978,United Kingdom,Stress and workload in pilots,"<title>Stress and workload in pilots</title> <abstract>Several studies have highlighted the increase in physiological activity which occurs in pilots during flight and especially during takeoffs and landings. For example, it has been clearly demonstrated that pilots' heart rates increase during the landing approach to reach a peak at or just before touchdown. These changes have been attributed to workload and to psychological or emotional stress. This paper examines a number of test pilots' heart rate responses recorded during various flight trials involving different types of aircraft. Examples include ramp takeoffs in a VTOL fighter, automatic landings in fog, supersonic flight through monsoon rain, and a sortie in which the pilot developed acute appendicitis. It is concluded that heart rate responses in experienced pilots are influenced almost entirely by workload-related factors and not by emotional stressors, such as risk and anxiety. Because of the emotional overtones of the word 'stress', it is suggested that the term workload should be used when referring to the reason for increased cardiovascular activity in pilots.</abstract>"
1978,United States,Speech intelligibility through communication headsets for general aviation,"<title>Speech intelligibility through communication headsets for general aviation</title> <abstract>Word discrimination was measured on eight general aviation pilots listening alternately through each of three communication headsets and an aircraft loudspeaker in the presence of light aircraft noise. Each subject listened at the speech intensity designated by him as yielded optimal intelligibility. Performance varied directly with the degree of attenuation provided by the headset. Mean intelligibility scores ranged from 73% through the loudspeaker to 92% through two of the headsets, although retesting through the loudspeaker at a higher signal level improved mean scores to 85%. Articulation functions obtained on four normally hearing listeners tested under the same conditions as the pilots revealed that, for situations when little or no attenuation was available (loudspeaker and one headset), greater signal-to-noise ratios were necessary to allow discrimination equivalent to that obtained under conditions of greater noise attenuation (two headsets). Although good intelligibility could be achieved through the loudspeaker given sufficient signal intensity (>100 dB SPL) some pilots preferred lower levels even though discrimination was reduced.</abstract>"
1977,United States,Any nurse can prevent dehumanization by the CCU experience,"<title>Any nurse can prevent dehumanization by the CCU experience</title> <abstract>This presentation deals with the Air Force Nurse as a novice assigned to a CCU area and her contributions to patient care as a member of the Air Force Health Care Team. The novice nurse's contributions to the patient's care lie in her ability to manage expected behavioral responses to the CCU experience even with a basic working knowledge of normal sinus rhythm and CPR procedure. The expected responses to the CCU experience discussed are: anxiety, denial, depression, and aggressive sexual behaviour. These usual behavioral responses have, at times, been referred to as 'a disease of medical progress' or the so-called 'intensive care syndrome'. The nurse is in a key position to observe the patient's behavioral responses since she spends most of the time with the patient. When these behavioral patterns are considered as part of a normal pattern of adaption, the nurse can utilize these for effective management of the patient's hospitalization experience as well as an indicator to the patient standpoint in his process of adaption. It would be wise to mention that the detailed manifestations and primary causes of these behavioral responses should be part of the nurse's working knowledge and can be easily referred to in recent texts on coronary care nursing. The presentation progresses to specific discussion on nursing intervention of the behavioral responses. In summary, the Air Force novice nurse to a CCU area can be an equally contributory member on the Health Care Team if not compelled to place an exaggerated amount of attention on equipment, but focus more on the patient, leaving more technical learning until she becomes more aware of the unit administration and has the opportunity to attend a coronary training course.</abstract>"
1977,United States,Catecholamine excretion in T 37 flight training,"<title>Catecholamine excretion in T 37 flight training</title> <abstract>Catecholamine excretion was determined for eight USAF student pilots during three basal and four T-37 training conditions. When viewed as the dependent variable, catecholamine excretion patterns support the conclusion that the Basic Cockpit Training Emergency Procedures unit was not stressful. The remaining lesson units, including Power-on-Stall and Spin-Recovery, First Solo, and Instrument Check lesson units, resulted in a pronounced stress response. When catecholamine excretion data were interpreted for psychological significance, it was concluded that the lesson unit which included Power-on Stalls and Spin-Recoveries created the highest arousal, anxiety and apprehension. Student pilot observations supported this interpretation. The relative excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine showed changes accompanying pilot training which may be interpreted as demonstrative of successful coping behavior.</abstract>"

1977,United Kingdom,Impairment of flying efficiency in anancastic pilots,"<title>Impairment of flying efficiency in anancastic pilots</title> <abstract>Previous work on the effects of stress upon flying efficiency has shown two types of psychological stress to exist; these are usually referred to as cognitive and affective stress, respectively. A refinement in affective stress analysis has enabled two subtypes of stress to be demonstrated: one is characterized by activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and subjective feelings of rage, fear, anxiety, or frustration; the other by excessive rumination. These two subtypes are found in differing personality configurations. Ten pilots exhibiting the former type of stress, and 6 with the latter, sought personal counselling regarding domestic problems. They underwent a regimen of 1 h weekly sessions consisting of a psychometric assessment, a psychophysiological evaluation of stress, and a complex ILS task in a specially modified type D4 Link Trainer. The performance of both groups, in terms of deviations from zero and RT to cockpit drill, was found to differ significantly from the standardized norms obtained from control groups in earlier studies, and to differ significantly from each other. The SNS aroused group showed maximum impairment at the beginning of the 20 min flight task, but gradually improved with time. The Ruminative group showed less, but consistent, impairment throughout the task. Overcontrolling was a characteristic of the former group, while errors of omission characterized the latter. The psychology of rumination is briefly mentioned, its incidence in pilots considered, and reference made to the beneficial effects of sodium diphenylhydantoinate for this condition.</abstract>"

A fifth diver, who served as a control, breathed only normoxic nitrogen. Psychological tests included digit span, short term memory for easy and difficult word associations, simple and complex psychomotor performance, and reported moods. The criterion of oxygen toxicity was the total hours of intermittent oxygen exposure tolerated before developing a 10% reduction in vital capacity. Short term memory for difficult word associations and self reported moods of Activity, Depression, Fatigue, and Happiness were found to be significantly correlated with this criterion of oxygen toxicity. Part of the impairment found on these measures, however, was probably related to the absence of adequate sleep and rest as evidenced by the worsened performance of the control diver over the 15 h testing period. The results replicated the findings of earlier research on the psychological effects of continuous oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions and at 1 ATA, and may indicate that oxygen intensifies the effects of other stressors such as fatigue. In addition, the results showed that reported moods may be important indicators of impending pulmonary toxicity during intermittent oxygen exposure.</abstract>"

The performance of 49 males employed as detection and communication equipment operators aboard military antisubmarine aircraft was measured in a dual-task situation, which combined a visual decision task and an auditory short-term memory task. Criterion scores from a standardized exercise in a radar training simulator were not significantly related to dual-task measures. Peer ratings, supervisor rank orderings based on flight performance, radar training grades, and indexes combining subjective and objective criteria were significantly related to dual-task measures. The dual-task measures, when combined with predictive measures available from aircrew selection tests, enhanced the potential predictive effectiveness.

A summary of services available to the Spacelab user is given, in which the load carrying capacity and the characteristics of the main subsystems (e.g. thermal control, environmental control, electrical power and energy as well as data management) are briefly described. Life science investigations may be undertaken for two reasons: firstly, to ensure safety and efficiency, and, secondly, for their scientific interest relating to effects of weightlessness or cosmic radiation. Safety of the crew and their genetic cells in relation to cosmic radiation is considered vital; essential knowledge is also required about the performance of the vestibular balancing mechanism and the related problem of ""stomach awareness"". The effect of zero-gravity on the cardiovascular system is studied, and the effect of circulatory changes in the brain, possible psychological stress and effects on exercise tolerance measured.

1976,United States,Measures of Attention as Predictors of Flight Performance,"<title>Measures of Attention as Predictors of Flight Performance</title> <abstract>A new technique for measuring individual differences in basic attention capabilities and the validity of these differences in predicting success in flight training were investigated. The testing system included a digit-processing, reaction-time task and a one-dimensional compensatory tracking task. Comparisons were made between separate and concurrent performances of thesetasks, with both equal and shifting task priorities. Adaptive techniques were employed to obtain maximum performance levels for each subject in the single-task condition and to maintain dual-task difficulty within subjects. Consistent individual differences in basic attention capabilities were observed and several dimensions of attention capabilities are suggested. A preliminary validation study compared scores for flight instructors and student pilots. In addition, the student sample was dichotomized based on performance in training. There were reliable differences for both groups on dual-task performance efficiency. © 1976, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

Such levels, while definitely exceeding normal limits, were attributed to acute psychosocial stress rather than to an abnormal or pathological process. One month after the completion of basic military training, mean serum urate levels were within normal limits, as were all subsequent mean urate levels. Mean serum cholesterol levels were elevated at three times - during the first week of training, after the first month of the first academic year, and during a week of intense military training in the following spring. Apparently, urate and cholesterol levels were elevated by different aspects of stress. Elevations of uric acid level appeared to reflect stress that excited fear or insecurity. Elevations of cholesterol levels appeared to reflect a stress which the individual perceived as requiring a sustained increase in physical and/or mental performance.</abstract>"
1975,United States,Human whole body exposure to infrasound,"<title>Human whole body exposure to infrasound</title> <abstract>Four male subjects were exposed to infrasound ranging from 1 through 20 Hz for a period of 8 min up to levels of 144 dB re 20 micropascal. There was no objective evidence (including audiograms) of any detrimental effect due to infrasound; however, all subjects experienced painless 'pressure build up' in the middle ear that was relieved by valsalva maneuver or by cessation of infrasound, and voice modulation and body vibration consistently occurred. It is concluded that infrasound exposures as high as 144 dB are safe for healthy subjects, at least for periods of 8 min, and it is predicted that longer exposures will also be safe.</abstract>"

1975,United States,Disorientation phenomena in naval helicopter pilots,"<title>Disorientation phenomena in naval helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>The incidence of pilot disorientation in fixed and rotary wing aircraft has been previously investigated, but special orientation problems of naval helicopter pilots engaged in operations at sea and landing on moving platforms have not been previously investigated. A questionnaire concerning disorientation was answered anonymously and individually by 104 active naval helicopter pilots. Fifty six percent indicated one or more episodes of severe disorientation, and 8.6% indicated having experienced severe disorientation five or more times while piloting helicopters. A number of factors conducive to disorientation were identified. Some precipitating factors appear to be specific to operations over water or over a moving deck, although some of these may well have their counterparts in special operations over land. Other factors are common to land and sea based operations, and some are common to fixed wing as well as rotary wing aircraft. A number of potential countermeasures for various precipitating factors are discussed.</abstract>"

1975,United States,Reactions to sonic booms: A report of two studies and a general evaluation of startle effects,"<title>Reactions to sonic booms: A report of two studies and a general evaluation of startle effects</title> <abstract>Two separate studies are reported. The first attempted to determine a sonic boom level below which startle would not occur. Subjects were exposed indoors to six simulated sonic booms having outside overpressures of 50, 30, and 16 N/m2 (inside levels of 74, 71, and 65 dBA). Approximately 20% of the subjects gave small arm hand responses to the two higher exposure levels, while none responded to the lowest level. In the second study, subjects were exposed indoors to a series of 12 simulated booms in order to assess habituation effects. Outside overpressures were 130 and 50 N/m2 (indoor levels of 81 and 72 dBA). Significant, but not complete, habituation occurred to booms of both levels. Autonomic and eyeblink responses, as well as ratings of annoyance, were obtained in both studies. The final section summarizes the expected behavioral, autonomic, and subjective effects of exposure to various levels of sonic booms.</abstract>"
1975,United States,Motion sickness questionnaire and field independence scores as predictors of success in naval aviation training,"<title>Motion sickness questionnaire and field independence scores as predictors of success in naval aviation training</title> <abstract>The present report has shown that a motion sickness questionnaire can be used to predict susceptibility to motion sickness or flight training success, depending on the items scored. There is a discussion of the theory that motion sickness results from conflicting preceptual inputs. This theory is related to aircraft operating conditions. Scores on a personality test which appear to be related to similar perceptual phenomena are related to aviation success. One phenotype, field independence, seems to be promising in this regard. In addition to the use of this finding in aviator selection, it is felt that studies of this trait, as it relates to an ability to reconcile conflict and to motion sickness insusceptibility, should be conducted.</abstract>"
1975,Belgium,Telemetric control of heart adaptation during automatic and free fall parachute jumps,"<title>Telemetric control of heart adaptation during automatic and free fall parachute jumps</title> <abstract>Telemetered heart rate recordings were obtained from 17 parachutists (6 during automatic jumps, 11 during free fall jumps). Catecholamine (adrenaline and noradrenaline) concentrations were measured in urine and plasma of 6 of these subjects. No difference appears between heart rates recorded in the 2 types of jumps at egress and at parachute deployment. On the other hand, higher heart rate values are recorded during automatic jumps during descent and at ground impact. The urine catecholamine analysis after jump shows a statistically significant increase in adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations. It is suggested that stimulation of the orthosympathetic system is due to 2 facts: muscular work performed during jumping and the emotional stress which it involves. The importance of these causes varies with the jump circumstances.</abstract>"
1975,United States,Visual reaction times during prolonged angular acceleration parallel the subjective perception of rotation,"<title>Visual reaction times during prolonged angular acceleration parallel the subjective perception of rotation</title> <abstract>Investigated the effect of prolonged angular acceleration on choice reaction time to an accelerating visual stimulus, using 10 commercial airline pilots as Ss. The pattern of reaction times during and following acceleration was compared with the pattern of velocity estimates reported during identical trials. Both reaction times and velocity estimates increased at the onset of acceleration, declined prior to the termination of acceleration, and showed an aftereffect. Results are inconsistent with the torsion-pendulum theory of semicircular canal function and suggest that the vestibular adaptation is of central origin.

1975,United Kingdom,Subatmospheric decompression: Neurological and behavioural studies,"<title>Subatmospheric decompression: Neurological and behavioural studies</title> <abstract>Several studies in animals over the past decade have shown that prolonged exposures to pressures within the range 226 mm Hg to 160 mm Hg (30,000 to 37,500 ft) are likely to lead to brain damage. This often results in neurological and behavioural disturbance, which may be subtle and reversible or gross and ultimately fatal. The appearance of these impairments is often delayed until several hours or even days after exposure. Immediate survival does not necessarily ensure recovery. In contrast, decompression to pressures below 160 mm Hg or above 226 mm Hg are unlikely to have adverse effects if the exposure is survived. The most probable outcomes of such decompressions are death or uneventful recovery. © 1975.</abstract>"

The experiment involved walking through a desert for 3 days, covering a distance of 90 km. Weight, urine samples, and hematocrits were taken before and after the experience. The psychological effects on the men is also recorded. The results obtained demonstrate the effects of the men's exposure to the sun's rays, the loss of weight and signs of hemoconcentration and the changes in character and behavior. Emphasis is placed on the need for training ensigns in the techniques of survival, especially in the desert.</abstract>"
1974,United States,Medical legacy of Apollo,"<title>Medical legacy of Apollo</title> <abstract>The Apollo Program answered questions raised by the medical legacy of Gemini and Mercury concerning whether the physiological changes seen were a result of confinement or a result of exposure to zero gravity. Since Apollo crews enjoyed freedom of movement and experienced many of the same problems as earlier crews, confinement had to be ruled out in the etiology of space flight related changes. Apollo was a mission of physiological firsts: the first inflight illnesses were reported and a series of cardiac arrhythmias occurred. The most important physiological changes were decreased cardiovascular responsiveness, reduced red blood cell mass, and musculoskeletal deterioration. Vestibular related problems were also noted for the first time. Crewmen lost weight as a result of a hypocaloric regimen inflight and a tendency to lose body tissue under hypogravic conditions. Aldosterone production increased causing some intracellular fluid loss. Very few of the crewmen experienced any psychological problems after Apollo.</abstract>"
1974,United States,Psychobiologic aspects of double crew long duration missions in C-5 aircraft,"<title>Psychobiologic aspects of double crew long duration missions in C-5 aircraft</title> <abstract>Subjective fatigue and oral temperature were used as biomedical indices in a study in which 2 jet transport crews alternately operated the aircraft. Data collected at 4 hr intervals during and following four 66 hr missions (each a roundtrip intercontinental flight) clearly established that these dissimilar functions were rhythmic and flight factors exerted modifying influence on both rhythms. Particularly significant was the finding that subjective fatigue on the average showed initial latency, an intensification phase, and a reversal phase. The last phase apparently represents a state in which there is endocrine metabolic and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity (compensation). Oral temperature and subjective fatigue responses to prolonged flight tended to run parallel courses. Recovery rates for subjective fatigue and oral temperature tended to be similar, and at least 3 days were needed for elimination of residual flight effects.</abstract>"

In facilitating the development of disadvantaged and low achieving adolescents to prevent potential maladaptation, community intervention programs are necessary. This paper describes an experience for children of Air Force personnel at an Air Force hospital overseas. Low achieving adolescents from the local school system for Air Force dependents were seen in the occupational therapy clinic on a regular basis. Using behavior modification techniques to manage the group, activities were then structured to meet the various needs of the students. Results of the program after its first year indicate that community intervention programs can be successfully implemented in hospital clinic settings.</abstract>"
1974,Norway,Additional heart rate - an indicator of psychological activation,"<title>Additional heart rate - an indicator of psychological activation</title> <abstract>Heart rate and oxygen consumption of helicopter and transport aircraft pilots were measured. During flight operations, the heart rate accelerated without a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption. This heart rate increase beyond that expected from the oxygen uptake, i.e. additional heart rate, is therefore used as an indicator of psychological activation. This activation did not depend only on the actual task, but also on the experience level of the pilot himself. The levels of heart rate (and blood pressure) recorded indicate taht even routine missions may impose a hazard to pilots with unmanifested or latent heart failure. This obviously calls for frequent workload ECG examinations of flying personnel.</abstract>"

1974,United States,Rotary acceleration of a subject inhibits choice reaction time to motion in peripheral vision,"<title>Rotary acceleration of a subject inhibits choice reaction time to motion in peripheral vision</title> <abstract>Studied the effect of S's rotary acceleration upon choice reaction time (RT) to an accelerating target in peripheral vision, with the level of acceleration and the viewing angle of the visual target as variables. 12 commercial airline pilots were tested in a rotation device under conditions of visual stimulation alone and visual-plus-rotary stimulation. Ss responded to the direction of the visual motion by moving a hand controller to the right or left. Visual-plus-rotary stimulation produced longer choice RTs than the visual stimulation alone. Choice RT was inversely related to the level of acceleration and directly proportional to the viewing angle. Findings are discussed in connection with theories of double stimulation and intersensory effects.

The evaluation continued over an 18 mth period, and consisted of psychological testing, laboratory investigations of physiological responses to imposed stress, and inflight assessment of psychophysiological functioning. The purpose of the study was to relate the objective changes in the pilot to the incidence and degree of domestic stress, and this is achieved at a satisfactory level of statistical significance. The role of domestic stress in impairing flying proficiency is discussed, and implications for the routine use of psychophysiologic tests as predictive and screening instruments are considered.</abstract>"
1974,United States,The role of man in system safety,"<title>The role of man in system safety</title> <abstract>The international airspace system comprises transport, control and communication modes on a global scale. While automation supplements, assists, improves and replaces man's role in the system, there will always be a man who plans, designs, monitors and supervises the system complex and its elements. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Medicine investigates the medical, psychological and social factors which are essential to the safe operation of the national airspace system. These studies include the definition of pilot and aircrew procedures, control, display and cockpit configuration and the presentation and transfer of information in the modern jet aircraft as well as in the air traffic control system. System safety starts with the selection and training of aircrew and ground personnel, continues through the application of air, crash and health worthiness concepts and aims at the elimination of the human errors which cause aircraft accidents, the decrease of injuries and loss of life resulting from accidents that do occur, and the improvement of the working conditions of airmen and ATC personnel in all parts of the national aviation system in which human factors are the major determinants of safety. Emphasis is placed on the development, refinement and standardization of research techniques and on the use of improved diagnostic methods for airmen certification.</abstract>"
1974,Canada,Evaluation of tissue postmortem lactates in accident investigation using an animal model,"<title>Evaluation of tissue postmortem lactates in accident investigation using an animal model</title> <abstract>It has been suggested by others that postmortem lactate concentrations in tissues of aircraft accident victims can provide valuable information about the premortem state of the individual. To test this hypothesis, an animal model system (rat) was established to simulate the field situation, incorporating the following operational variables: postmortem time of tissue collection, temperature at accident site, and time of last food intake. A control tissue profile (liver, brain, kidney, spleen, skeletal muscle, heart) of postmortem lactates from normal animals was established. All of the variables tested were found to affect the final postmortem lactate levels. Tissue postmortem lactates from animals which were in a state of hypoxia (8,300 m, for 15 min), or fear (30 to 90 sec), at death, were then compared to the standard profile. Premortem fear did not result in any significant deviation of tissue lactates from the control profile, while hypoxia produced significant elevations in postmortem lactate in brain and kidney of only some of the animals. The findings with the animal model indicate that postmortem lactate measurement is of no value in the identification of premortem adrenergic (fear) stress, and only of limited value with respect to hypoxia.</abstract>"

1974,United States,Behavior of naive subjects during decompression: an evaluation of automatically presented passenger oxygen equipment,"<title>Behavior of naive subjects during decompression: an evaluation of automatically presented passenger oxygen equipment</title> <abstract>In a study designed to provide data on the behavior of airline passengers confronted with a rapid decompression, 20 male and 20 female subjects without previous high altitude experience were given a standard airline oxygen equipment briefing. Following the briefing, the subjects were slowly decompressed to 5,000 ft in an altitude chamber. After a 10 min hold at this altitude, the subjects were rapidly decompressed to 20,000 ft. This decompression profile was used to minimize the effects of hypoxia on behavior immediately following the decompression. The times required to notice, obtain, don, and breathe from automatically presented oxygen masks were observed. Mask donning times were not distributed normally. The data suggest that the sample may have been drawn from at least two populations, one composed of persons who respond very rapidly in the face of a simulated emergency, the other of persons who respond relatively slowly. It is hypothesized that differences in covert anxiety may be a factor. No sifnificant differences in mask donning were associated with type of mask presented, or age or sex of the subjects. Slow donning, incorrect donning, and failure to don the masks reduce the protective ability of present commercial aircraft oxygen systems. Explicit donning instructions in passenger briefings and use of warning devices might measurably improve mask utilization.</abstract>"
1973,United States,Comparison of the job attitudes of personnel in three air traffic control specialties,"<title>Comparison of the job attitudes of personnel in three air traffic control specialties</title> <abstract>A total of 792 journeyman air traffic controllers from ARTCC, TRACON, and FSS facilities answered a four part questionnaire concerning what they liked and disliked about ATC work, how much they liked or disliked certain specific aspects of ATC work, how they felt about shift work, and their level of job satisfaction. In general, the three ATC specialties showed high agreement in their job related attitudes. They liked most of their job tasks and the challenge of ATC work; they tended to dislike management, their work schedules, and job tasks not directly related to traffic control or flight service. Concerning shift work, it was found that the most negative attitudes were associated with night (2400 to 0800) shifts. Controllers also indicated a preference for rapid turn around shift rotation schedules. Finally, these satisfaction questionnaires indicated that approximately 91% of the controllers surveyed were satisfied with their occupational choice. However, most had other career aspirations for the future. The findings were discussed in terms of the similarity of the controller groups to members of other occupations, and in terms of the significance of the findings for improving controller morale.</abstract>"
1973,United Kingdom,Physical energy expenditure in long haul cabin crew,"<title>Physical energy expenditure in long haul cabin crew</title> <abstract>A study of the physical energy expenditure of BOAC's cabin crew was carried out as part of a workload survey. It was not considered possible to place a respirometer on a crew member during a normal commercial flight on aesthetic grounds and an indirect method of measurement was, therefore, devised. Due to the variety of duties that cabin staff carry out it was necessary to analyse their working day and break it down into a number of defined tasks. Volunteers were asked to carry out these tasks in the training mock up whilst wearing a Max Planck respirometer. From the results obtained, the subjects' energy expenditure per minute was calculated. Experiments were carried out to show that the figures obtained were equally applicable at cabin altitudes. By means of time and motion studies and questioning the cabin crew an 'average working day' and a 'maximum working day' were built up. The energy expenditure was then estimated. This was compared with that of other working groups. From the studies carried out it is concluded that the cabin crew's working day is a hard one due to the sustained nature of the work rather than tremendous energy expenditure at any one moment. At the same time it is within accepted limits for physical work. How arduous the job is must not be assessed in physical energy expenditure alone, however, but must take account of psychological, physiological and environmental factors as well.</abstract>"
1973,United States,Stress and strain in student helicopter pilots,"<title>Stress and strain in student helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>The heart rates of nine volunteer subjects were studied during 223 hrs of primary helicopter flight training. Segments of heart rate data representing 3,952 replications of five standard training maneuvers were selected for analysis, together with 645 segments while the helicopter was on the ground before, during, and after flight instruction periods. Heart rates after flights were generally higher than before the same flights. Heart rates on the ground tended to increase over 20-25 hrs of flight instruction. This trend toward increases in heart rates was also observed during dual flights, whether the instructors or students were flying. During solo flight, in contrast, heart rates tended to decrease in most students. Student heart rates were highest during flight checks in eight of nine subjects. These data are indicative of a moderate and sequentially increasing level of psychological stress in students undergoing dual flight instruction in helicopters. The exception to the sequential trend was solo flying. These trends may be a reflection of stress induced by the evaluatory role of the flight instructors.</abstract>"

Primary emphasis was upon the emotional reactions of these individuals to the experiences, rather than to a specific summary of equipment breakdown or procedural failures. These harrowing experiences were tolerated remarkably well by the crewmen involved who, with rare exceptions, retained their objectivity and precision of observations. The psychological deviations experienced were, for the most part, within normal limits and even those which were extreme did not reach the point of psychic incapacitation of the individuals involved. The study emphasizes the value of training and the resilience of the healthy, trained individual in even the most trying of circumstances.</abstract>"
1973,United States,Need satisfaction in the identification of the DOR,"<title>Need satisfaction in the identification of the DOR</title> <abstract>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether student pilots who voluntarily drop from the program (DORs) and those who successfully complete training enter the flight program with different 'needs', and whether DORs and 'completers' differ in their evaluation of the program's ability to satisfy their needs. The needs that were explored were those of the Maslow hierarchy, including physiological, safety, and security, social, self esteem, and self actualization needs. Eighty seven aviation officer candidates were given a questionnaire designed to measure optimism, relevance, and importance in terms of the five needs described above. They were given the test initially on the third day after entering the program (Time I), and then again after 9 weeks of training (Time II). The results indicate that DORs differ from completers in their evaluation of how well their needs are satisfied. Within the first 9 weeks of training, DORs indicated that meeting their needs was more 'important', though they were less 'satisfied' and optimistic' than completers, particularly with regard to the self actualization need.</abstract>"

Altitude state was the coded variable. Ss were 36 male undergraduates. It was hypothesized that (a) color coding would be superior to numeric coding, particularly with a greater number of total items displayed; and (b) color would be relatively more efficacious with a greater number of items in the interrogated state. Neither of these hypotheses were supported. Based on an error-type analysis, it is concluded that color can aid in retaining information concerning category size and item spatial location; identity information was quickly lost.

1973,,Some psychological and engineering aspects of the extravehicular activity of astronauts.,"<title>Some psychological and engineering aspects of the extravehicular activity of astronauts.</title> <abstract>One of the main in-flight problems being fulfilled by astronauts is the preparation for and realization of egress into open space for the purpose of different kinds of extravehicular activity, such as, the performance of scientific experiments, repairing and dismantling operations etc. The astronaut's activity outside the space vehicle is the most difficult item of the space flight programme, which is complicated by a number of space factors affecting a man, viz. dynamic weightlessness, work in a space suit under conditions of excessive pressure, difficulties of space orientation etc. The peculiarities mentioned require special training of the cosmonaut. The physical training involves a series of exercises forming the body-control habits necessary for work in a state of weightlessness. In a new kind of training use is made of equipment simulating the state of weightlessness. From analysis of the available data and the results of my own investigations during ground training and the Soyuz 4 and 5 flights one can establish the following peculiarities of the astronaut's extravehicular activity: (1) Operator response lag in the planned algorithm; (ii) systematic appearance of some stereotype errors in the mounting and dismantling of the outer equipment and in scientific-technical experiments; (iii) a high degree of emotional strain and 30-35% decrease in in-flight working capacity of the astronaut compared with the ground training data; (iv) a positive influence of space adaptation on the cosmonaut and the efficiency of his work in open space; (v) the necessity for further engineering and psychological analysis of the astronaut's activity under conditions of the long space flight of the multi-purpose orbital station. One of the main reasons for the above peculiarities is the violation of the control-coordination functions of the astronaut in the course of the dynamical operations. The paper analyses the extravehicular activity of the astronaut and presents some recommendations for its more efficient realization. Proposals are given concerning the complex engineering, psychological and technical investigations to be made during in-flight egress.</abstract>"

In this training scheme, the tendency for pilots to contrive, in various ways (use of alcohol or sedatives), to sublimate anxieties in order to lessen the effects of stress is openly discussed, and recommendations are made, medically, to help the subject through periods of tension in the course of his training.</abstract>"
1973,United States,Self-estimates of distractibility as related to performance decrement on a task requiring sustained attention,"<title>Self-estimates of distractibility as related to performance decrement on a task requiring sustained attention</title> <abstract>Increasing automation of air traffic control tasks may have the undesirable side effect of increased monotony as a result of the anticipated reduction in task demands. Since individuals who are unable to sustain attention under low task-load conditions would appear to be more likely to commit errors and be less able to handle a sudden emergency situation, it would seem desirable to examine the characteristics of individuals unable to sustain attention under these conditions. In the present study, 50 subjects performed a monotonous, but perceptually demanding task, for approximately 30 minutes without rest. It was found that high-distractibility subjects (as determined from a questionnaire administered prior to the experiment) showed increasing lapses of attention during performance, while low-distractibility subjects failed to show any evidence of a decline in attention. Significant changes were obtained for respiration, respiration-period variability, heart-rate variability, and skin conductance during the task period, but the magnitude of these changes did not differ among the two distractibility groups. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
1973,United Kingdom,The effects of core temperature elevation and thermal sensation on performance,"<title>The effects of core temperature elevation and thermal sensation on performance</title> <abstract>A liquid-condition suit was used to obtain a state of raised body temperature in conjunction with skin temperatures compatible with sensations of thermal comfort. This condition produced a similar increase in speed of performance on a high-level reasoning test which has been found in previous experiments, but no decrement in score. Head cooling was included as a separate variable but appeared to have no additional effects on the speed or level of performance. It is suggested that deep body temperature may determine the speed, and comfort the level, of performance and that the technique of differentially heating body core and skin should prove a useful tool for further research. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

1972,United States,Random living schedule: Psychological effects in man,"<title>Random living schedule: Psychological effects in man</title> <abstract>In order to determine whether regularity of environmental and living schedules in man is necessary for normal psychological functioning, subjects lived on random schedules for 14 consecutive days. No impairment of cognitive or personality functions was detected. The results suggest that individual differences in subjects' ability to adjust their sleep to a random schedule may be determined in part by personality factors. High scores on California Psychological Inventory scales of Intellectual Efficiency, Sense of Well-being, Dominance, Self-acceptance, Sociability, Achievement via Conformance, and Psychological-mindedness, and low scores on Femininity predicted better ability to sleep at irregular times. Being a good sleeper may protect one against sleep loss on irregular schedules, but the psychological effects of sleep loss per se are not great. © 1972.</abstract>"

Of 100-proof vodka/kg of s weight, while the others drank a control beverage. Tests, conducted 1-10 hr. After drinking, were in total darkness with the exception of the illuminated visual display. Static tracking errors for alcohol ss were significantly higher than those of controls only at the 4-hr session. However, alcohol ss made significantly more dynamic tracking errors during the 1-, 2-, and 4-hr sessions and, concomitantly, had significantly more nystagmic eye movements and higher rates of slow phase eye velocity than did controls. Results indicate that, although eye-hand coordination may show little or no impairment following alcohol ingestion in static situations, it may be seriously degraded during motion.

Ss in both experiments either (a) were trained entirely with pictorial displays and provided with assumptions involved in constructing the air traffic situations, or (b) were initially trained with displays containing verbal descriptions of possible situations and not given underlying assumptions. In Exp. I, a secondary loading task was performed concurrently with the decision task. In Exp. II, Ss analyzed both redundant and nonredundant displays. Results indicate that the procedures acquired by pictorially trained Ss were less susceptible to processing overload and that an additional performance advantage derived from their use of redundancy in the displays.

A moment of conscious brain control is put forward as a unit to quantify this kind of mental load. New action programs are supposed to require conscious brain control at every step of their execution; with routine this would be less and less the case. The duration of a moment of conscious control varies according to the complexity of the control to be exercised and the number of considerations which have to be taken into account. Propositions are made on how to think about selective attention, identification and cognitivo processes in terms of executing programs. A job description method is put forward in terms of such executing programs. Vhy moments of conscious brain control as units are more suited to the problem of mental load than are units like bits, choices and decisions is discussed.

Evaluation of these tasks is important for selection of personal, for job evaluation, and for redesigning tasks and jobs in order to fulfill the tasks of ATe in future. This evaluation of man's tasks can be regarded either from the demands of the job or from their fulfillment and effect for man. Both aspects have to be connected to get objective results which are valid for man.

1971,Japan,Maintaining concentration (Taf) as a measure of mental stress,"<title>Maintaining concentration (Taf) as a measure of mental stress</title> <abstract>Fatigue has been discussed both in physiological and psychological terms. Undoubtedly these two aspects of fatigue interact upon each other and it may be difficult to distinguish between the two. It is known that a certain degree of change in human functions caused by work-lead may result in lowered activity, and produce a Subjective feeling of fatigue. For fatigue evalunt.ion, the latter may serve only as a reference, while the former may be measured in terms of performance, which must be a combined output of mental activity and physiological functions. A solution to this problem may be the TAF·test, which has been devised as a new quantitative fatigue test based on the concept of TAF. The average level of the TAF curve (TAF-L) and its standard deviation (TAF-D) are compared for pre-and post work values and/or among different groups statistically. As to the qualitative or psychological aspect. it is generally accepted that stress stimuli bring about certain neurophysiologic changes. At present, the mecholyl test is recognized as a reliable means of showing the strength of homeostatic defense III the hypothalamus. However, in comparison to the dangers of the mecholyl test, the CPT-swing degree, which we have developed, Italy safely be used to identify the qualitative nature of the stress. It is concluded that fatigue can be dealt with quantitatively by the TAF-test and qualitatively by the CPT .swing degree. © 1971 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The analogue allowed formal information load to vary independently of numerosity. Ss detected potential collision situations in a sequence of independent displays. 2 experiments, each involving 2 levels of stimulus uncertainty and 3 levels of presentation rate, were conducted. In Exp. I, 8 male undergraduates were trained entirely with pictorial displays and were provided with the assumptions involved in constructing the air traffic situations. In Exp. II, 8 Ss were initially trained with displays containing verbal descriptions of possible situations and were not given underlying assumptions. Information transmission was less and RTs were greater when verbal displays were initially used to make the dimensional structure of the stimuli salient. Transmission was an inverse function of stimulus uncertainty, regardless of presentation rate, in both experiments. (16 ref.)

Assessments made included rectal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, palmar evaporative water loss, urinalysis, reaction time, decision time, critical flicker fusion, subjective fatigue and well-being, and intellectual facility. The intercontinental flights consisted of east-west and west-east flights which permitted a comparative analysis of bidirectional effects of time zone displacements and a north-south flight which provided an appraisal of effects solely attributable to prolonged flight. Shifts of the phase of circadian periodicity manifested by the physiological functions were effected by the east-west and west-east flights but not by the north-south flight. Bidirectional differences in lag time and extent of dissociation were revealed, but these may be due to individual variability. All flights engendered significant increment in subjective fatigue. Only one flight, the east-west, produced significant performance deficit indicating that while rapid translocation through many time zones does effect physiological phase shifts requiring 4-6 days for completion and impairment of well-being, these phenomena are not accompanied by a commensurate change in the efficiency of basic psychological functions.</abstract>"

The questionaires covered three areas of interest; frequency of occurrence, degree and duration of three directional disorientation, namely pitch, bank and yaw directional disorientation according to writers classification. The questionaires submitted by 87 pilots revealed 100% of the pilots had experienced one or more episodes of spatial disorientation. It must be paid consideration to that there is a difference between pilots category of “vertigo” and definitional category of spatial disorientation. The problems how it influences to pilots control or the reasons why it is dangerous are as follows. It is apt to occur when flight condition is disadvantageous. It is apt to lead aircraft to accident from itsphysical and psychological characteristics and its variety. These problems were discussed through pilot's interview investigation about cases of incidents, also old statistic studies were reffered to. About the possibility of prevention and alleviation of the spatial disorientation by training, there are tow affirmative and negative thoughts among the pilots and old records. However in this report, it was concluded that it is possible to prevent and alleviate spatial disorientation foundamentaly by training. © 1966, The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, Inc.

The wide scope of psychiatry as a medical specialty allows for the appropriateness of such requests. But divergence from the traditional role raises problems. In the situation of being asked to select candidates for a space mission the primary problem is in identifying the most healthy individual. Fifteen candidates for a space mission were evaluated by a team of two psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist. All of the candidates were found to be qualified as being free from psychopathology. Beyond this, a rank order of the candidates was developed, based on positive factors of suitability for the assignment. There are no ready-made guidelines, specific stress situations, or personality type qualifications on which to readily determine such a selection. The psychiatrist must approach such a task in a globally oriented manner, making the most of his talent for empathic understanding of the individual candidate's personality and motivations. © 1965, American Medical Association.

At last he flew so high that the heat of the sun melted the wax, and off dropped the wings. CONTEMPORARY developments in bioastronautics have challenged the once held assumption that “man is a sea-level, lowspeed, one G, 12-hour animal.”49 The physical dangers of space flight for the astronaut previously anticipated with uncertainty, have thus far been technologically overcome.2,4,7,9 But even after the successes of recent short-term space explorations,26,27 the question of man's capacity to withstand the emotional and psychological effects of sensory isolation and deprivation is not fully answered.* It is now thought, however, that the use of two-man teams will obviate in large part the hazards of acute sensory deprivation.52 In 1957, Clark and Graybiel found in their study of the. © 1965 IEEE All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1964,United States,The Effect of Rule Flexibility on System Adaptation,"<title>The Effect of Rule Flexibility on System Adaptation</title> <abstract>A study was performed to test the effect of strict vs. flexible operating rules on a simulated terminal air traffic control system under a variety of traffic conditions with constant load. Twelve college students were trained in control procedures, were assigned to two crews, and operated the system in a sequence of 24 problem sessions in which the variables were arranged in factorial combination. Only the change to more flexible rules produced consistently significant performance changes. The differences in the way the two crews responded to the changes in the rules depended on the degree of crew cohesiveness. A theoretical formulation of system adaptation derived from earlier studies with an air defense system is discussed, and a new formulation is presented which is consistent with the findings in both the present and the earlier studies. © 1964, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

1963,United States,United States experience on the utilization of man's capabilities in a space environment.,"<title>United States experience on the utilization of man's capabilities in a space environment.</title> <abstract>This paper concerns the stresses on the flight crew in various phases of space flight missions and the ability of the crew to perform piloting-type tasks as well as other specific operations in the presence of these stresses. The mission phases include powered flight, free flight, space maneuvers, atmospheric entry, terminal phase, and surface operation. The stresses of the space environment are caused by forces and or motions or lack thereof, the space environment itself, the nature of the environment within the spacecraft, and the mental and physical demands on the flight crew. Among crew functions are control of the onboard systems, navigation and guidance of the spacecraft, maintenance and emergency operation, communications, and the conduct of scientific experiments. The paper draws on information obtained from the flight research to date as well as from ground tests and analyses. From the results one can conclude that man can very ably withstand the stresses of short duration missions into near space and has demonstrated ability to perform the type of tasks associated with flight crew operation. The chief unknown factors of future flight operations are the stresses produced by longer duration missions. Consideration of the problems involved leads to the conclusion that they are amenable to engineering solution at some expense to spacecraft weight and performance. It appears desirable therefore to utilize the flight crew to a high degree in future missions in the type of tasks where human judgment is needed or where significant simplification of on-board equipment may result.</abstract>"

Six two-man teams were observed. Each team worked under each of three supervisors. The supervisors shifted from team to team. Three techniques were adopted alternately: laissez-faire, active monitoring, and direct participation. It was observed that the individual supervisor was a more consistent influence on performance than the particular role he employed. The effect of role per se was significant but interpretable only in light of the particular performance criterion used. For example, processing speed was greatest under laissezfaire conditions, while error avoidance was superior under the conditions which required more overt supervisory activity.

Students' logs were evaluated for five separate missions by comparing the students' entries with standards determined by experts. The reliability of this technique is indicated by the fact that mission to mission inter-correlations of error scores were low, while the intercorrelations between legs of the same mission were moderately high. The intercorrelations between the error scores for the different navigation variables were computed and analyzed by using both factor analysis and multiple regression techniques. Both analyses indicated that a major portion of all dead reckoning error could be attributed to errors made in determining magnetic deviation.

2025,Romania,Anchoring as a Mechanism for Modifying Risk-Taking Behavior in Military Aviation,"<title>Anchoring as a Mechanism for Modifying Risk-Taking Behavior in Military Aviation</title> <abstract>This study explores the possibility of using anchoring biases to change the risk-taking behavior assessed by the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). The study involved 90 military aviators who participated in a United Nations-led peacekeeping mission. We used an experimental design in which participants performed BART tasks distributed differently in the experimental groups to change the risk-taking behavior. After three stages, our results showed that the values of the indicator measuring risk-taking behavior were reduced in the low-anchor experimental group when operating in conditions of uncertainty. This indicator is influenced, in risk conditions, by both motor impulsivity and anchoring bias. Impulsivity is moderately associated with risk-taking behavior. The results also show that Big Five personality factors are not significantly associated with risk-taking behavior. In conclusion, these results confirm the role of the anchoring mechanism in changing risk-taking behavior and verify the strong relationship between impulsivity and risk behavior when individuals act in risky conditions. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2025,United States,"A Theoretical Model to Understand Flight Instructors’ Safety Behaviors in the United States: Through Personality Traits, Self-Efficacy, Risk Perception, and Safety Climate","<title>A Theoretical Model to Understand Flight Instructors’ Safety Behaviors in the United States: Through Personality Traits, Self-Efficacy, Risk Perception, and Safety Climate</title> <abstract>Safety is an important aspect for any organization or individual to be successful, and the field of aviation has no exceptions. A CFI is authorized to give training and endorsements required for student, private, commercial, and instrument pilot certificates. CFIs play a very critical role in the success of pilot-in-training students at flight schools (Osman et al., 2022). According to AOPA (2015), the two greatest risks in flight training are loss of control inflight (LOC) and midair collisions. Moreover, approximately 71% of the accidents in which a CFI was involved happened during takeoff/climb, low-altitude maneuvers, and Instrumental Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The probable cause of LOC and midair collisions was due to poor decision-making, bad judgment, and unsafe behaviors of the CFIs (AOPA, 2015). In psychological aviation research, various perspectives, such as those associated with social cognition and personality, have attempted to explain individual differences in risky behaviors and accident involvement (Ji et al., 2011). The purpose of the present study was to build a theoretical model that demonstrates the relationship between personality traits, self-efficacy, risk-perception, safety climate, and safety behaviors of CFIs. A literature review was conducted to identify the existing relationships between the target constructs used in the study and the safety behaviors among workers across various aviation and non-aviation work settings. Over 100 abstracts were reviewed for relevancy, and 43 articles published between 1990 and 2020 were selected for full review. Of the 43 articles selected, only 30 articles were thoroughly reviewed and used to extract information. The results indicated the proposed theoretical model: (a) CFIs’ personality traits as measured by CFIs levels of Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness will directly influence their safety behaviors; (b) CFIs’ self-efficacy and risk-perception named as affective domain variables will have a direct influence on their safety behaviors; (c) CFIs’ safety climate will directly influence their safety behaviors; (d) CFIs’ self-efficacy and risk-perception will mediate the relationship between CFIs’ personality traits and safety behaviors; and (e) Flight school’s safety climate, will moderate the relationship between CFIs’ personality traits and their safety behaviors.

The mission time window generation method is introduced, and the constraint satisfaction model for task scheduling in the InSAR satellite system is constructed. To address the mission allocation issue between the chief satellite and deputy satellites, a mission conflict detection and resolution mechanism is developed. Moreover, based on the single-objective student psychology-based optimization (SPBO) algorithm, a modified non-dominated sorting SPBO (NSSPBO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the multi-objective task scheduling problem for the InSAR satellite system. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NSSPBO algorithm. © 2025, Departamento de Ciencia e Tecnologia Aeroespacial.

2025,China,Mediating Roles of Resilience and Stress in Emotion Regulation Strategies and Pilot Job Burnout,"<title>Mediating Roles of Resilience and Stress in Emotion Regulation Strategies and Pilot Job Burnout</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pilot burnout significantly affects flight safety. Despite research on related factors, the intrinsic links between pilots’ emotion regulation and burnout are not thoroughly analyzed. The distinctive work environment necessitates advanced emotional regulation skills. Exploring these mechanisms is crucial for understanding and addressing pilot burnout effectively. METHODS: T he study performed a path analysis on survey data from 106 Chinese civil aviation pilots to explore the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and job burnout. RESULTS: T he findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal affects job burnout through perceived stress and psychological resilience while expressive suppression impacts it via perceived stress. Family-work conflict and organizational stress significantly contribute to burnout, with the model showing a high fit (Comparative Fit Index = 0.99) and an R2 exceeding 0.5. DISCUSSION: T his research pioneers an emotion regulation perspective in pilot job burnout analysis, suggesting innovative interventions. It emphasizes the need for holistic strategies, addressing psychological resilience enhancement and organizational culture issues to mitigate job burnout effectively. By enriching the theoretical and practical foundations in pilot job burnout management, this study offers crucial insights for the field’s development. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,,"Mars Mission Communication Delays and Impact on Mission Controller Performance, Workload, and Stress","<title>Mars Mission Communication Delays and Impact on Mission Controller Performance, Workload, and Stress</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Mission Controllers (MCs) are the main point of contact for space crews and are vital for successful human spaceflight. On a mission to Mars, there will be as long as 22-min one-way communication delays between the ground and the crew, causing major changes to current communication infrastructures. METHODS: This exploratory study assessed the impact of a 20-min one-way communication delay on MCs' task performance, workload, and stress levels under nominal and off-nominal conditions, conducted during a 21-d analog mission. RESULTS: Decrements in performance were noted on both nominal and off-nominal task completion in time-delay conditions [100% of real-time (rt) tasks complete, 16.7% of time-delay (td) tasks incomplete; 12.50% of nominal tasks and 33.33% of off-nominal tasks were incomplete]; more errors on task record forms (td = 6 forms, rt = 1 form); higher ratings of workload burden (nominal, td workload = 38.64; off-nominal, td workload = 58.72; nominal, rt workload = 34.00, off-nominal, rt workload = 52.78). No significant changes in MC stress levels were detected in rt compared to td, but MCs did report greater stress during off-nominal tasks compared to nominal tasks. The crew, however, were unable to detect these changes in MC stress levels. DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings point to the importance of future research focused on MC training and adapting MC's operations for time-delayed missions. Further studies of time-delayed analog missions could help determine additional solutions focused on technology advances. Diamond M, Leon GR, de León P.

2025,United States,Implementing an Enrollment Cap in a Southeastern Collegiate Flight Program,"<title>Implementing an Enrollment Cap in a Southeastern Collegiate Flight Program</title> <abstract>A southeastern land-grant university decided to impose an enrollment cap on its Part 141 collegiate flight program due to increased enrollment pressures and limited availability of training resources. This article presents a case study of the planning and implementation of an integrated two-stage admission program that focused on selecting students based on academic rigor, preparedness, and aviation readiness. A diverse selection committee of both military and civilian flight training experts reviewed 493 applicants using a rubric-based examination of aviation experience and essay responses, while excluding standardized test scores and high school grade point averages (GPAs). In the process, student motivation, ability to perform well on the FAA written exam, and any prior aviation experience were highlighted while avoiding placing a competitive disadvantage on non-pilot applicants. The quality of the essays and the degree to which the candidate demonstrated dedication to aviation made more difference in a person's selection than licensure alone. The study concludes with recommendations for incorporating personality and grit assessments in future iterations to enhance predictive validity and reduce reviewer workload. © 2025.</abstract>"
2025,Turkey,A new approach for prioritising personality traits causing pilot error,"<title>A new approach for prioritising personality traits causing pilot error</title> <abstract>Pilot personality traits are among the most critical risk factors contributing to human error in aviation. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines a risk assessment matrix and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to prioritise personality traits leading to pilot errors. The proposed framework first identifies unacceptable traits among commercial airline and military pilots and then uses AHP to calculate their relative importance. Findings reveal that for commercial pilots, a lack of self-discipline and rule-consciousness are the most critical traits, while for military pilots, a lack of self-discipline, absence of rule-consciousness, overconfidence, and neuroticism are the dominant traits. The proposed model offers a proactive and systematic method to evaluate pilot personality characteristics, supporting the development of more effective pilot selection and training systems to enhance flight safety. © © 2025 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</abstract>"
2025,Canada - Netherlands,Gleaning from Diaries in Long-Duration Isolation,"<title>Gleaning from Diaries in Long-Duration Isolation</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: a 264-d isolation simulation, sFiNcss-99, was conducted in Moscow to replicate typical scenarios on an orbital space station. One long-term group of four Russian crewmembers occupied the isolation complex for most of the duration (240 d), while two international groups of four each spent 110 d successively at the complex. additionally, there were several short visits by medical personnel. the main objective of this paper is to investigate group and individual behavioral dynamics, particularly the intercultural challenges faced during long-duration isolation, using insights from crewmembers’ diaries. METHODS: a variety of instruments and training activities, employed before, during, and after the mission, formed this multifaceted experiment. One key component, crewmembers’ diaries, is the primary data source for this analysis. RESULTS: While unstructured instruments can be challenging to analyze, these diaries proved especially useful for studying group dynamics and identifying behavioral and intercultural issues. the crewmembers found our unstructured formats, such as these journals and post-mission interviews, to be a more effective means of expressing themselves compared to structured instruments. DISCUSSION: Personal journals, open-ended questions, and the freedom from constraints typically imposed by feedback instruments used for quantitative analysis are invaluable for observing and expressing crewmembers’ psychological status, as well as inter-crew and intercultural dynamics. Personal journals can also provide a basis for constructive intervention by ground personnel, researchers, or psychologists. insights from this study can be applied to current challenges, such as the adoption of self-isolation as prevention against spread of cOViD-19.

2025,United States,Sensory-Based Alterations and Countermeasures in Spaceflight and Spaceflight Analogs,"<title>Sensory-Based Alterations and Countermeasures in Spaceflight and Spaceflight Analogs</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: long-duration spaceflight and isolated, confined, and extreme environments present various challenges to crewmembers. One less-frequently discussed challenge is altered sensory inputs and how they can adversely affect cognition and performance. Maintaining psychological and performance outcomes is crucial for mission success, and simple sensory-based countermeasures (cMs) can be surprisingly effective. this scoping review examines the impact of altered sensory inputs in these extreme environments, assesses current sensory-based cMs, and compares their effectiveness across sensory modalities to guide future strategies. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through comprehensive searches of PubMed, PsyciNFO, Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and the NASA technical Reports Server. Searches included keywords related to the sensory modalities under investigation and potential outcomes. this review focused on english-language publications, with no date restrictions for sensory alterations and a focus on studies published after 2019 for countermeasure research. RESULTS: Spaceflight leads to sensory changes that affect health and performance. these alterations are highlighted, finding particularly prominent changes in lighting and auditory modalities. these changes result from altered sensory inputs and environmentally driven physiological alterations. Sensory input modulation can influence cognitive and psychological states, affecting performance. Sensory-based cMs were examined for their impact on psychological and performance domains. A total of 285 articles on sensory alterations and 180 on cMs were reviewed, with 52 and 59 articles included, respectively. DISCUSSION: Sensory-based cMs offer promising approaches to maintain or improve performance. Modulating sensory inputs can mitigate spaceflight-related challenges. Personalized, multisensory approaches appear particularly promising. the review highlights research gaps and suggests avenues for enhancing sensory cMs. Reprint and copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,France - Russian Federation,Affective States in a Space-Analog Mission and Insights from Psychometric and Hair Cortisol Measures,"<title>Affective States in a Space-Analog Mission and Insights from Psychometric and Hair Cortisol Measures</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Long-duration space missions introduce stressors that can disturb the affective states of astronauts (e.g., isolation, workload). However, studies in space or in space-analog environments struggle to find a consensus on the affective impact of these stressors. Also, there is a lack of research using multiple measures to assess affective states in these conditions (e.g., positive and negative measures and physiological parameters). More research is needed to understand the psycho-physiological mechanisms during long-duration space-like missions. Our study was conducted during a space-analog confinement (SIRIUS-19). Throughout the mission, we assessed variations of affective states using subjective and physiological parameters. We expected interindividual variability, with transitory and chronic changes on the psychological and physiological dimensions of affective states. METHODS: Six subjects (three men/three women; four Russians/two Americans; age = 33.83 ± 6.37) performed the protocol once a month during the 4-mo confinement. Subjects completed various psychometric scales about their affective states (Self-Assessment Manikin, Positive and Negative Affective Schedule) and provided hair cortisol samples. Due to the small sample size, only individual values and descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Psychometric measures remained positive and stable. Hair cortisol levels increased at the beginning of the mission (from 31.79 ± 18.05 pg · mg−1 to 62.25 ± 31.99 pg · mg−1). Most of the measurements showed interindividual variability. DISCUSSION: T he subjective affective states remained positive and relatively stable throughout the mission. The initial increase of hair cortisol is attributed to an adaptation phase of the crew. No affective variation seems to be related to this phase. Our results indicate effective affective adaptation to the confinement. copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2025,United States,Expanding Ketamine Application for Treatment of Acute Suicidality in Long-Duration Spaceflight,"<title>Expanding Ketamine Application for Treatment of Acute Suicidality in Long-Duration Spaceflight</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The transition to exploration missions places a heightened risk on behavioral health in spaceflight. Although serious psychiatric emergencies during spaceflight have been rare, longer duration missions increase the possibility of emergence in latent mental health disorders due to genetic predisposition, increased autonomy, isolation, helplessness, loss of family member, or catastrophic events. Complicated grief and bereavement have the highest rate of suicidal ideation. Recently, ketamine has been used as an emergent intervention for acute suicidality, promoting its stability, ease of administration, favorable safety profile, and outcomes for reduction of suicidal intent. The goal of this study was to review current literature and collate the understanding of ketamine as a safe, effective pharmacological adjunct for acute suicidality in spaceflight. METHODS: This literature review was conducted to collate data on ketamine use for acute suicidality and inform on stability, limitations, and utilization of ketamine within extreme environments. RESULTS: There were 122 publications reviewed for relevance, including 23 randomized-control trials for ketamine use in behavioral emergencies. DISCUSSION: Ketamine is a diverse pharmaceutical with multiple advantageous indications, including acute suicidality, pain, and sedation. Terrestrial use of ketamine suggests a rapidly efficacious medication for reduction in acute suicidality. As behavioral stressors expand related to extended missions, contingencies for behavioral emergencies become increasingly important. Although this review is not intended to redevelop current International Space Station protocols, it is the first to discuss the benefits of ketamine in spaceflight as a potential safe, effective, multifaceted tool for exploration missions and treatment for acute suicidal ideation. © 2025 Copyright c by The Authors.

2025,China - France,Changes in Risky Behavior in Long-Term Head-Down Bed Rest and Relation to Psychological Status,"<title>Changes in Risky Behavior in Long-Term Head-Down Bed Rest and Relation to Psychological Status</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: the present study aimed to investigate changes in risky behavior in a sample of 36 healthy men during a 90-d head-down bed rest (hDBR) experiment and examined whether psychological factors—general self-efficacy, stress, and recovery—could influence these changes. METHODS: subjects completed the Balloon analog Risk task (BaRt) and two psychological scales once during the acclimation period, six times during the hDBR period, and twice during the recovery period. During the hDBR period, subjects were required to maintain a −6° head-down position for most daily activities and only permitted to change positions around the longitudinal axis of their bodies. RESULTS: the results demonstrated that subjects’ risk-taking behaviors were significantly affected by bed rest, with an increased propensity to engage in risky activities during the head-down stage. in addition, BaRt scores did not return to baseline when subjects entered the recovery stage. in terms of psychological variables, the results indicated that scores of general self-efficacy and recovery were negatively correlated with BaRt indicators, while stress levels were positively correlated with risky behaviors. compared to other psychological variables, the perceived physical stress, including fatigue, somatic complaints, and sleep quality, exhibited the strongest correlations with BaRt indicators. DISCUSSION: the findings of this study implied that prolonged exposure to a simulated microgravity environment and confined isolation conditions may have a sustained impact on risk-taking tendencies, with changes in risky behaviors in the head-down state more closely associated with physiological symptoms. © © by The Authors.</abstract>"
2025,United States,The Earth-Disconnect Phenomenon as a Psychological Stressor for Martian Crewmembers,"<title>The Earth-Disconnect Phenomenon as a Psychological Stressor for Martian Crewmembers</title> <abstract>NTRODUCTION: From mars, the earth will appear as an insignificant dot in the heavens and two-way communication with family and mission control can take up to 44 min. the resulting impact of these restrictions on crewmembers may be termed the earth-disconnect phenomenon. the literature suggests that seeing the earth as a beautiful orb in space is an awe-inspiring experience (the overview effect), the loss of which may produce isolation and loneliness. not being able to communicate with family and mission control in real time may produce emotional distress and impaired performance. Strategies to help crewmembers deal with these issues include using a telescope or virtual reality to better experience the earth and suggesting future response topics and using more formal messaging techniques to improve communication efficiency. more study needs to be done using simulators, a space station, or the far side of the moon to better understand this phenomenon.

2025,Denmark - United Kingdom,Psychological Adaptation in a Mixed Sex and Ability Team During a Ski Expedition to the South Pole,"<title>Psychological Adaptation in a Mixed Sex and Ability Team During a Ski Expedition to the South Pole</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: expeditions in remote locations are becoming increasingly commonplace. as the composition of teams change, understanding team dynamics is important to inform subsequent expeditions in challenging environments. METHODS: eight individuals (five men, three women; five military, three civilians) completed a ski expedition from the Ronne ice shelf to the south Pole over 47 d. a mixed methods observational cohort study was undertaken, involving completing pre-expedition Multidimensional Personality Questionnaires and Portrait Values Questionnaires. During the expedition individuals completed the isolated and confined environments Questionnaire and the Positive and Negative affect scale at 7-d intervals. subsequent semistructured interviews using a topic guide informed by Goffman’s “total institution” were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire and Portrait Values Questionnaire responses were similar between participants. the isolated and confined environments Questionnaire results showed significant variation with no clear trend. statistical significance was seen in social and emotional domains between sex and occupations. Positive and Negative affect scale scoring demonstrated higher positive affect (mean ± sD; 38.9 ± 1.5) to negative (13.1 ± 1.3). subgroup analysis demonstrated significance for negative affect between sexes (one result skewed the data). the interviews highlighted that individuals found the routine and lack of personal space challenging. interpersonal relationships were a source of support but also friction. DISCUSSION: Despite similar initial questionnaires and experiences during the expedition, subjects used a diverse range of coping strategies. interpersonal factors remain the most important aspect in ensuring a successful team and pre-expeditionary work should be carried out focusing on this.

2024,Netherlands,The Effect of Personality Traits and Flight Experience on Pilots' Cognitive and Affective Responses to Simulated In-Flight Hazards,"<title>The Effect of Personality Traits and Flight Experience on Pilots' Cognitive and Affective Responses to Simulated In-Flight Hazards</title> <abstract>We investigated the effect of personality traits and flight experience on pilot cognitive and affective responses across seven startling and surprising scenarios performed in motion-based simulators. A dataset of 89 airline pilots from four studies was used. The personality traits measured were trait anxiety, decision-related action orientation (AOD), and failure-related action orientation (AOF). Pilot self-reported responses in scenarios were standardized by obtaining z scores of startle, surprise, stress, and mental workload. Only trait anxiety was found to be significantly positively correlated with stress. No significant effects of AOD, AOF, or flight hours were found on pilots responses. The results indicate trait anxiety may affect pilots responses to stressful scenarios, even though pilots are selected based on low trait anxiety. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,United States,Facial Expression Perception and Psychological Changes During Space Analogs,"<title>Facial Expression Perception and Psychological Changes During Space Analogs</title> <abstract>Facial expression perception is the process by which someone can interpret the emotion of another individual using their facial cues. Below-average scores on tests designed to measure facial expression recognition (FER) accuracies are associated with inappropriate behavioral responses and are often linked to mental or neurological disorders. Head-down bed rest microgravity analog studies show changes in facial emotion processing that may indicate a behavioral health risk during spaceflight. METHODS: During short-duration space analog missions at two separate facilities, 15 subjects took daily FER tests before, during, and after the mission. Each test was accompanied by questionnaires measuring either potential causal or impacted variables: stress, depression, loneliness, irritability, risk-taking, empathy, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS: Analysis of variance and post hoc t-tests showed that during the mission, the subjects were less likely to identify angry, sad, or fearful faces as disgusted compared to the baseline. Also, interest/enjoyment and perceived competence increased throughout the mission lifecycle. Multiple regression analyses were able to account for greater than 20% of the variance for depression and health/safety risk-taking using the FER data. DISCUSSION: Changes in FER during space mission simulations show that perception changes are not limited to microgravity analogs. A perceptual change was observed during the short-duration missions, but there is not sufficient evidence to show behavioral health impacts. However, associations between FER and the questionnaires show a potential to develop predictive models, countermeasures, or psychological monitoring tools using FER. Additional research is required to determine the efficacy of such tools during long-duration spaceflight. © (2024), (Aerospace Medical Association). All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2024,United States,Evolution of Space Medicine at NASA,"<title>Evolution of Space Medicine at NASA</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: From the very beginning of America’s human spaceflight program, space medicine has been at the forefront. There has been a variety of diverse individuals, over six decades, whose contributions helped shape what space medicine is within NASA today. METHODS: A n extensive review of historical documents (including reports, manuscripts, advisory committee reports, and oral histories of key individuals) related to space medicine, aerospace medicine, and life sciences at NASA Headquarters was performed. RESULTS: E arly in NASA’s history, oral histories from individuals in key leadership positions were obtained. In addition, repeated searches of the archives provided a plethora of material on space medicine and life sciences from the first two decades or so, but it is somewhat sparse over the most recent four decades. Each of these sources helped develop a historical narrative of those key individuals who were in senior leadership positions at NASA Headquarters beginning in 1958 through the present time. DISCUSSION: A review of the archived material tells a compelling story of how and why space medicine developed in the way it did at the agency level. The inspiration and the individual personalities, concomitant with the early influence from the U.S. Air Force, laid the groundwork for this discipline as it relates to human spaceflight. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2024,New Zealand,A Grounded Theory Exploration of Addictions Treatment Within a Commercial Airline Setting,"<title>A Grounded Theory Exploration of Addictions Treatment Within a Commercial Airline Setting</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: A n Australasian Airline’s Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Program demonstrates abstinence rates that exceed those of general AOD programs. The reasons for this are unclear. The purpose of this research was to develop a theory as to why this program is successful. METHODS: A qualitative examination following grounded theory methodology was undertaken. AOD program patients and healthcare professionals were interviewed until content saturation was reached. Data analysis followed grounded theory to identify the key concepts associated with the program’s success. RESULTS: T he core theory that emerged highlighted the pivotal roles of a strong employee–company relationship, shared values, and a safety-focused culture in explicating the program’s success. This moves beyond the “carrot and stick” model of motivation, where belonging to this organization and safety consciousness serve as powerful drivers for abstinence. Challenges and barriers highlighted some unique challenges to the program in managing the coronavirus pandemic and the difference in approach to substance use in community spaces versus safety-critical employment. DISCUSSION: T his research expands the understanding of this AOD program’s success in a safety-critical industry, emphasizing the elements of a working relationship that are beyond positive or negative reinforcement. Future research should work to quantify and test the generalizability of these findings. © (2024), (Aerospace Medical Association). All Rights Reserved.</abstract>"
2024,Germany,The Role of Basic Flight Simulators in the Selection of Ab Initio Airline Pilots,"<title>The Role of Basic Flight Simulators in the Selection of Ab Initio Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: This paper aims at identifying the factors influencing performance in basic flight simulators in the selection of ab initio pilot candidates and to determine the incremental value of these flight simulators in predicting performance in flight training. Background: Several factors such as cognitive ability, personality, and demographic information are discussed to be associated with performance in basic flight simulators. Many commercial flight operations tend to refrain from using flight simulators in the selection of ab initio pilot candidates in favor of less expensive test batteries. Method: Study 1 uses 4,340 candidates in the selection of major European airlines to investigate the factors influencing performance in the basic flight simulator. Study 2 then uses 1,753 candidates to evaluate the incremental validity of the basic flight simulator in predicting issues in flight training. Results: Multiple task ability, gender, and previous flight experience are the strongest predictors of performance in the basic flight simulator. Still, the flight simulator shows significant incremental validity in predicting problems in flight training. Conclusion: These findings seem to justify the additional use of a basic flight simulator in the selection of ab initio pilot candidates. Despite a strong correlation with more economical multiple task ability tests, the flight simulator still shows incremental validity in predicting success in flight training. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2023,Russian Federation,Crew Interaction in Extended Space Missions,"<title>Crew Interaction in Extended Space Missions</title> <abstract>Detection of the extent of common values in a cohesive space crew has become an important trend in modern space psychology. It is known from the works of Ch. Osgood that the semantic differential scale is a reliable way to obtain objective information on the emotional attitudes towards a topic of interest. Within the frame of the Russian space experiment “Interactions” on the International Space Station (ISS), a computerized survey, the Personal Self-Perception and Attitudes (PSPA), was developed for analyzing the subjects’ emotional attitudes toward their social environment. In the course of the PSPA procedure, the crewmembers rate each other and themselves (in the past, present, and future) using the criteria previously personally chosen. These criteria should be regarded as their personal values. A total of 30 subjects have already completed the study on board the ISS. The main tasks of the study are: (1) to define individual and group values and the extent of group identification reflected in sharing these values; (2) to determine the impact of cross-cultural factors on mutual perceptions and self-perceptions in space crews and with the Mission Control Center (MCC); (3) to study changes in the space crews’ group cohesiveness and structure as they are exposed to the stress of the extended space mission environment. The data obtained indicate an increase in a “psychological distance” between the crew and the MCC personnel versus increased crew cohesion. The results gained made it possible to identify the most significant categories of values common to the subjects from the professional cosmonaut group. The priority of these shared values for each subject is an important condition for the formation of a cohesive crew. © 2023 by the authors.</abstract>"

Behavioral health and performance among spaceflight teams are key aspects impacted by team composition and cohesiveness. METHODS: T his narrative review highlights areas of consideration for building cohesive teams in long duration spaceflight environments. The authors gathered information from a variety of team-behavior related studies that focused on team composition, cohesion, and dynamics, as well as others topics such as faultlines and subgroups, diversity, personality traits, personal values, and crew compatibility training. RESULTS: T he literature suggests that team cohesion occurs more easily when individuals are similar to one another, and deeplevel variables such as personality and personal values have a greater impact on crew compatibility than surface level variables such as age, nationality, or gender. Diversity can have both positive and negative impacts on team cohesiveness. CONCLUSION: T eam composition, as well as pre-mission conflict resolution training can greatly impact group cohesion. This review aims to map areas of concern and assist with crew planning for long duration spaceflight missions. © Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2023,United States,"Astronaut Candidate, Candidate-Like, and Undergraduate Subjects Compared on Retention and Transfer","<title>Astronaut Candidate, Candidate-Like, and Undergraduate Subjects Compared on Retention and Transfer</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The present study examined long-term retention and transfer of knowledge and skills, as well as the effect of cognitive load on retention and transfer, using a sample of astronaut candidates and two comparison groups. The first comparison group, recruited from Johnson Space Center, was similar in age, education, and general health to the astronaut candidate group; the second comparison group included university undergraduate students. METHODS: This study employed two different tasks—a simple perceptual-motor task involving data entry and a complex memory updating task requiring both prospective and retrospective memory. Subjects completed multiple sessions involving both tasks over a 500-d period, with test sessions involving transfer and/or a cognitive load manipulation. For the perceptual-motor task, transfer involved changes to the stimuli that increased intrinsic cognitive load or changes to the required motoric procedures. For the memory updating task, extraneous cognitive load was increased by the addition of a concurrent secondary task. RESULTS: For both the perceptual-motor and memory updating tasks, astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects performed more accurately, with greater speed, and were less impacted by increased cognitive load than undergraduate students. Despite the generally superior performance of astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects, they were more likely to experience negative transfer on the perceptual-motor task, whereas undergraduate students demonstrated positive transfer. DISCUSSION: Candidate-like subjects provided a more accurate approximation of astronaut candidate performance than did undergraduate students, especially with regard to negative transfer effects and cognitive load. © copyright by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2023,Australia,The Link between Individual Predictors of Risk and Risky Flight Behavior: A Systematic Review,"<title>The Link between Individual Predictors of Risk and Risky Flight Behavior: A Systematic Review</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to highlight how pilots’ risk perception is measured, and the relationship between individual predictors of risk and risky flight behavior. Background: Risk is an intrinsic part of life with no action void of risk. Risk-taking is mediated by several factors which include age, sex, cultural background, and personality. Understanding how pilots’ risk perception is measured allows for improved understanding of pilots’ propensity to engage in risk, and for the design of training initiatives to mitigate risky behavior. Method: A systematic review was conducted to establish the link between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior. The systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines, covering the time span between 1985 and 2021. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were revealed. Results: Three of the 16 articles employed an in-situ behavioral measure for risky flight behavior. Forecasting, where an individual predicts his/her action in a particular circumstance was the most used measure to deduce pilots’ risk-taking behavior. No predictor variable reliably predicted pilots’ risky flight behavior. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the majority of research examining the relationship between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior relies on self-reported measures or scales as opposed to in-situ performance measures such as data captured during flight or in a simulator. Such performance measures are susceptible to demand characteristics. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2022,United States,Personality Trait Comparison of Pararescue Personnel and Elite Athletes,"<title>Personality Trait Comparison of Pararescue Personnel and Elite Athletes</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pararescue personnel (PJs) deploy in high-risk environments and perform extraordinary missions under intense conditions, requiring an unusual combination of physical and psychological abilities. The rigorous nature of PJ training and the superior levels of fitness and cognitive functioning to perform challenging physical feats in high-pressure, high-intensity environments have prompted military commanders and embedded health care providers to compare successful performance in the PJ mission with the characteristics required of elite, Olympic-level athletes. METHODS: I n the current study, we tested this assumption by comparing the social, emotional, and behavioral functioning of 160 U.S. PJ training candidate graduates and 73 elite, Olympic-level track and field athletes using scores on the NEO Personality Inventory-3. RESULTS: Results from this study suggest that although there are physical and psychological challenges inherent in both the PJ and elite athlete career fields, the emotional, social, and behavioral performance of PJs differs in functional ways from the elite athlete population, with PJs scoring significantly lower in Neuroticism and higher in Extraversion and Conscientiousness.

2022,United States,Exploring Personality and Stress during Communication Delays in Simulated Spaceflight Missions,"<title>Exploring Personality and Stress during Communication Delays in Simulated Spaceflight Missions</title> <abstract>To date, there are no studies exploring how an individual’s unique personality profile predicts their response to the stresses and challenges of communication delays on Long Duration Exploration Missions (LDEMs). When exploring astronaut selection for future LDEMs, the Big Five personalities have been identified as a relevant model of personality and one of the preferred models among NASA scientists. This study examined whether personality predicts stress levels when experiencing communication delays during simulated spaceflight missions. A predictive correlational design explored the relationship between personality and stress levels while experiencing a 2-minute one-way communication delay during a simulated Mars mission. Personality included the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience) and locus of control (LOC). Stress levels were reflected by the difference in stress (DS) scores measured using a stress Visual Analog Scale (VAS). There were significant relationships between conscientiousness and extraversion, both of which were significant predictors of DS scores. LOC was also significantly associated with DS scores. Conscientiousness and extraversion predicted stress when experiencing communication delays. LOC was also identified as a predictor of stress levels. These findings benefit the characterization of crew selection and composition of future spaceflight teams. They also promote a multi-trait, multi-method approach to astronaut selection. © 2022 A publication of the University Aviation Association.</abstract>"
2022,Belgium,Do Personality Traits Predict Training Performance?: the Use of a Personality Questionnaire for Air Traffic Controller Selection,"<title>Do Personality Traits Predict Training Performance?: the Use of a Personality Questionnaire for Air Traffic Controller Selection</title> <abstract>Most test batteries for the selection of ab initio air traffic controllers (ATCOs) include a personality questionnaire. However, the literature suggests that the relationship between personality and job performance is not straightforward: Correlations are found only for a limited set of personality factors, depend on job characteristics, and are at best small to moderate in size. Moreover, the relationship between personality scores and performance can be curvilinear rather than linear. This research investigates whether a personality test used for the selection of ATCOs predicts subsequent training performance. Training performance was measured in terms of instructor ratings (N = 262) and training outcome (N = 431). The rated training performance correlated positively with general self-efficacy and team orientation, and negatively with negativity and vulnerability. For some traits (i.e., general self-efficacy and rebelliousness), curvilinear relationships were found. A comparison of trait scores between students who had successfully completed and those who had failed the training showed significant differences for 10 of the 17 measured traits, all of which were in the expected direction. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

METHODS: two male architects were studied who lived and worked over a 60-d period in a polar ice environment in a lunar analog habitat they designed and helped construct. Psychological measures were completed at different points of the mission, including a post-mission debriefing interview. RESULTS: team members were highly different from each other on a number of personality traits, personal values, and stress and coping factors. Marked differences were noted on NeO-Pi-3 agreeableness and extraversion personality traits, and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) stimulation, Power, and achievement values. team effectiveness Questionnaire (teQ) findings showed consistency between team members with high ratings on the Passion and commitment and Purpose and Goals scales, and low ratings on the Roles scale. the leveling influence of decision authority and its deleterious effect on interpersonal interactions and work performance was evident. the interior design with attention to materials that made it more earth-like and the circadian lighting system were associated with ease of work performance and promotion of relaxation and privacy. DISCUSSION: the study findings demonstrated the impact of incompatibility in personality traits and values on team performance, challenges regarding decision authority in a long-term dyadic relationship, and highlighted the human factors components of the habIPit:at1t0h3at.3fa.c2il3it1at.e6d6eOffenc:tiTveuien,d1iv5iduFael ban2d0t2ea2m1f0u:n0c2ti:o3n2ing. © 2022</abstract>"
2022,Australia - United States,Risk-taking Propensity: A Comparison between Pilots and Members of the General Population,"<title>Risk-taking Propensity: A Comparison between Pilots and Members of the General Population</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this research was to understand risk, predictors of risk, and for pilots the relationship between personality as determined by the risk prediction scales and flight performance. Background: Risk-taking is a topic that draws attention because of its link with the causation of injury. In the literature, there are a large number of papers linking personality traits to self-reported risk-taking, in addition to theoretical commentaries. In contrast, there are very few empirical studies that examine the link between personality traits, such as risk-taking and actual risk-taking behavior. Method: One hundred university students with no flying experience (59 females) and 17 pilots (five females) completed a battery of personality and risk scales. Pilots were also tasked to complete a simulated flight involving a low-level flying task. Results: The results revealed that pilots had a higher propensity for risk than the general population. However, this risk was tempered by the personality factor of self-control. Evidence of this juxtaposed position was present during the simulated flight; pilots’ propensity for risky behavior was inversely related to actual risk-taking behavior. Conclusion: These results indicate a dichotomy in risk-takers, impetuous and calculative risk-takers. These findings have important implications for pilot selection and training. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,Saudi Arabia,Aircraft assembly snags: Human errors or lack of production design?,"<title>Aircraft assembly snags: Human errors or lack of production design?</title> <abstract>To err is an intrinsic human trait, which means that human errors, at some point, are inevitable. Business improvement tools and practices neglect to deal with the root causes of human error; hence, they ignore certain design considerations that could possibly prevent or minimise such errors from occurring. Recognising this gap, this paper seeks to conceptualise a model that incorporates cognitive science literature based on a mistake-proofing concept, thereby offering a deeper, more profound level of human error analysis. An exploratory case study involving an aerospace assembly line was conducted to gain insights into the model developed. The findings of the case study revealed four different causes of human errors, as follows: (i) description similarity error, (ii) capture errors, (iii) memory lapse errors, and (iv) interruptions. Based on this analysis, error-proofing measures have been proposed accordingly. This paper lays the foundation for future work on the psychology behind human errors in the aerospace industry and highlights the importance of understanding human errors to avoid quality issues and rework in production settings, where labour input is of paramount importance. © 2021 by the authors.

Studies conducted during such conditions have suggested that whereas some people may experience such a phenomenon, it is not a typical occurrence in space or space simulation environments. Possible reasons for varying outcomes include demand characteristic bias, individual personality traits, training omissions, experimental methodological issues, and the impact of mission events on crewmember well-being.

While AI/ML and SDF concepts have had a rich history since the early 1900s-emerging from philosophy and psychology-it was not until the dawn of computers that both AI/ML and SDF researchers initiated discussions on how mathematical techniques could be implemented for real-time analysis. ML, and in particular deep learning, has demonstrated tremendous success in computer vision, natural language understanding, and data analytics. As a result, ML has been proposed as the solution to many problems that inherently include multi-modal data. For example, success in autonomous vehicles has validated the promise of ML with SDF, but additional research is needed to explain, understand, and coordinate heterogeneous data analytics for situation awareness. The panel identified opportunities for merging AI/ML and SDF such as computational efficiency, improved decision making, expanding knowledge, and providing security; while highlighting challenges for multi-domain operations, human-machine teaming, and ethical deployment strategies. © 1986-2012 IEEE.</abstract>"

Background: The pre-flight safety briefing is a required presentation that must be administered to all passengers before conducting a flight. This briefing is most commonly delivered via a live demonstration by flight attendants or through the aircraft’s in-flight entertainment system, such as a seatback video. Method: Using a sample of 876 participants from the United States, we examined the influence of familiarity, anticipatory flight anxiety, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and frequency of flying on willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing. The study used a quantitative correlational design with structural equation modeling techniques for data analysis. Results: The results supported 5 of the 7 hypotheses. High levels of flight anxiety resulted in less willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing. Significant positive relationships were found between familiarity, conscientiousness, agreeableness on the willingness to watch. A strong relationship between willingness to watch and stated actual watching also was found. Conclusions: The study’s findings provide insight into what factors influence a passenger’s willingness to watch and examine the role personality factors have on willingness. As a result of this study, insights are gained into possible ways to increase passengers’ willingness to watch the pre-flight safety briefing and their consumption of this vital safety information. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,China,Sea Voyage Training and Motion Sickness Effects on Working Ability and Life Quality After Landing,"<title>Sea Voyage Training and Motion Sickness Effects on Working Ability and Life Quality After Landing</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: The effects of seasickness on working performance during motion exposure have been reported, while the aftereffects on working ability and life quality decline (WLD) still remain unclarified. METHODS: Two cohorts of healthy male Chinese subjects received either a single (SSV) or repeated (RSV) sea voyage training program on different vessels. A seasickness incidence (SSI) questionnaire was administered to assess the prevalence of seasickness symptoms (vomiting, nausea, other, or no symptoms). A WLD questionnaire was used to survey the general feeling of WLD (severe, moderate, slight, and none) by a 4-point score as well as the incidence rate (IR) of specific WLD items within 24 h after landing. RESULTS: The RSV cohort had lower overall IR of WLD than the SSV cohort (54.64% vs. 63.78%, N 5 657 for both cohorts). The landing ship trainees in both cohorts showed higher general WLD score and higher IRs of physical fatigue, sleep disorder, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those trained on the small vessels. Subjects with vomiting or nausea had higher general WLD score and higher IRs of concentration distraction, physical fatigue, anorexia, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those with no symptoms. Higher IRs of firing accuracy decline (SSV: 21.35% vs. 7.13%, 9.14%; RSV: 22.11% vs. 9.28%, 5.27%), equipment operation disturbance (SSV: 16.85% vs. 3.57%, 6.85%; RSV: 20.47% vs. 7.85%, 7.03%) were also observed in the vomiting subjects than those with other symptoms and no symptoms. DISCUSSION: Significant WLD after landing was associated with transportation types, seasickness severity, and habituation during sea voyage training. © © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2020,Turkey,Analytic Hierarchy Process–Based Selection Method for Airline Pilot Candidates,"<title>Analytic Hierarchy Process–Based Selection Method for Airline Pilot Candidates</title> <abstract>Objective: In this study, a new selection method for airline pilot candidates is developed. Background: In a large majority of previous studies, parametric statistical classification methods have been commonly used for the pilot candidate selection process. These kind of methods require a representative sample with sufficient numbers of good and poor candidates to minimize the standard error associated with the regression weights and to ensure prediction accuracy. In this study, a new pilot candidate selection method has been developed, which can also be used in cases where there are not enough candidates or there is not a significant relationship between predictors. Method: The model was developed by using an analytic hierarchy process technique. A survey was conducted with airline pilots working at Turkish air carriers to determine the weights of the selection criteria considered in the model. The minimum success score of each criterion was obtained from the survey results. The analyzes are carried out using the Super Decisions program. Results: We found that the most important factor among the pilot candidate selection criteria is psychomotor coordination and operational abilities with a coefficient of 0.37306. Conclusion: The survey results revealed the importance of flight abilities and personality traits for pilots and it also found that lack of motivation is the most important problem among new airline pilots. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,Social acceptance of increased usage of the ballistic parachute system in a general aviation aircraft,"<title>Social acceptance of increased usage of the ballistic parachute system in a general aviation aircraft</title> <abstract>Background: An airframe parachute (""Chute"") available in certain aircraft is designed to lower the airplane safely to the ground for emergency situations that occur 500 ft (152 m) above ground level (AGL): the ""Chute altitude envelope."" This study will explore the change in Chute use before and after 2012 to better understand factors that increased usage and improved accident outcomes. Methods: Using the public National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database from January 1, 2001, through August 31, 2018, a regression model was developed to identify factors that may predict Chute use. Results: In accidents occurring after January 1, 2013, pilots were 5 times more likely to use the Chute, while 2.9 times less likely to use the Chute when the accident involved pilot-related causes. The presence of passengers did not predict Chute use. Injuries were likely to be more severe when the Chute was used outside the Chute altitude envelope. Discussion: In contrast to General Aviation (GA) overall, accidents outcomes in aircraft equipped with a Chute have seen great improvements between 2013 and 2018, with increased use of the Chute and improved injury outcomes. Results suggest that changes to pilot training in 2012 have increased the social acceptance of Chute use. Results highlight increased risk of injury outcomes for Chute use in accidents that occur outside the Chute altitude envelope. © 2020 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2019,Germany - Russian Federation,"Operational and experimental tasks, performance, and voice in space","<title>Operational and experimental tasks, performance, and voice in space</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Voice analysis offers an unobtrusive approach for psychological monitoring. We demonstrate the relationship between voice parameters and cognitive performance in: 1) a task with psychological test character, and 2) performance in an operational, mission-relevant task. The central methodological aim was to verify the usefulness of voice commands and counting in providing anchor values for the step-function model of voice pitch. METHODS: During a 22-yr period, 42 cosmonauts participated in the Russian space experiment ""Pilot"", which was a hand-controlled docking maneuver. As reference the experiment included the cognitive task ""Manometer."" This task was controlled through voice commands. These voice commands were stored and are the basis for the present analysis. RESULTS: Cosmonauts differed in their working style and respective performance during the Manometer task. Clustered groups can be assumed to represent different effort. Importantly, these groups differed in the changes of voice pitch among mission phases and among task repetitions. However, there were no differences between these motivation groups and performance in the professional task. DISCUSSION: The differing effort is the effect of different motivation of cosmonauts for experimental test tasks vs. mission-relevant professional tasks. Latter ones provide a more reliable chance to assess the real actual state and skills of a cosmonaut. Voice pitch measurement seems to be reliable and useful under space conditions for monitoring this volitional effort. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2019,Brazil - Spain,Psychophysiological intervention to improve preparedness in military special operations forces,"<title>Psychophysiological intervention to improve preparedness in military special operations forces</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Actual studies in military training support the use of new methodological approaches such as high intensity interval training and inverse periodization training rather than conventional approaches. However, the application and analysis of success of these new methodologies are as yet unknown. METHODS: The military adapted the civil reverse periodization training system, composed of 6 wk and five sessions per week. For the first 3 wk soldiers performed two sessions with the objective of increasing the maximal strength of the upper and lower body muscles, and three sessions of short high-intensity interval training (HIIT). In the following 3 wk they combined two endurance HIIT and two resistance HIIT sessions with military equipment while conducting a military task. RESULTS: After the training a significant body mass index decrease was found, along with an increase in lower limb muscular strength, aerobic and anaerobic performance, resilience, stress tolerance, and psychological flexibility. Regarding the ratio of acceptance there was an increased ratio compared to previous years of 7%. In addition, married soldiers with children presented greater resilience, stress tolerance, psychological flexibility, and a higher ratio of success. DISCUSSION: Accepted soldiers presented greater psychological status and stress tolerance, highlighting the importance of the work of the unit psychologists to reinforce and monitor the psychometric profile of the soldiers as well as their intrinsic characteristics of personality and emotionality. The greater baseline physical condition and higher performance in all physical tests proves how reverse periodization training models are a great stimuli and training approach in soldiers. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2019,China,Anticipated negative emotions effect on incident involvement among civil pilots,"<title>Anticipated negative emotions effect on incident involvement among civil pilots</title> <abstract>Introduction: Human factors have contributed to a constant increase in the level and numbers of aviation incident involvement. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between anticipated negative emotions (ANEs) and incident involvement among Chinese civil pilots. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of risk perception and proactive coping within the relationships in order to understand the mechanisms underlying pilots' involvement in air transport incidents. Methods: A cross-sectional regression design was used to measure ANEs (Anticipated Negative Emotions Scale), proactive coping (Proactive Coping Scale), risk perception (Pilot Risk Perception Scale), and incident involvement (Hazardous Events Scale) among 295 Chinese civil pilots from China Southern Airlines. Mediation and moderating effects were explored using regression analyses and were confirmed by the bootstrapping approach. Results: The results show that ANEs are significantly correlated with risk perception (r = - 0.55) and incident involvement (r = 0.28). ANEs have a direct effect on pilot involvement in incidents and have an indirect effect on pilot incident involvement through the influencing of risk perception. Proactive coping was also found to weaken the direct effect of anticipated negative emotions on incident involvement. Discussion: The safety benefits of proactive coping are more pronounced among pilots with high levels of ANEs. The practical implications of the study include recommendations relating to injury prevention efforts in incident involvement. Future research directions are also discussed. © 2019 Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2019,United Kingdom - United States,"Individual attributes, values, and goals of an all-military women antarctic expedition","<title>Individual attributes, values, and goals of an all-military women antarctic expedition</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: While participation of women in the military has increased, research on performance of female teams engaged in arduous physical activity in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments remains sparse. METHODS: A team of six British military women completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire-Brief Form, Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and Personal Values Questionnaire (PVQ) prior to embarking on an expedition that traversed the Antarctic continent. Questionnaires were completed weekly on the ice; repeat of the PVQ and individual semistructured debriefing interviews were carried out within 9 d post-expedition. RESULTS: Personality findings indicated a generally well-adjusted group with notable individual differences in personality and personal values. Positive affect and camaraderie among teammates was evident throughout, although pace vs. distance in the strategy of the daily trek was a continuing point of tension. Honesty in communication was viewed as key to team effectiveness. A significant post-expedition decline in the tradition value (Pre M = -0.55, SD = 0.99; Post M = -0.82, SD = 1.12) and an increase in the conformity value (Pre M = -0.26, SD = 0.46; Post M = 0.18, SD = 0.27) was found. DISCUSSION: Congruence in personal and team goals among group members engaged in highly challenging activities is crucial for optimal team performance. Presence of two highly dominant individuals has a negative effect on team dynamics.

2018,China,Posturographic balance's validity in mental and physical fatigue assessment among cadet pilots,"<title>Posturographic balance's validity in mental and physical fatigue assessment among cadet pilots</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Postural control is adversely affected by mental and physical fatigue, but its validity in fatigue assessment has not been investigated systemically among pilots. We explored the correlations of posturographic balance with physiological and psychological signals among cadet pilots. METHODS: In experiment 1, 37 cadet pilots performed a posturographic balance test, heart rate variability (HRV), and profile of mood states (POMS) during 40 h of sleep deprivation. For experiment 2, physiological signals of 60 subjects, including breathing rate (BR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR) were measured under the effects of physical fatigue. Then correlations with a mental and physical fatigue index based on effective posturographic parameters with those subjective and objective methods were analyzed by linear regression. RESULTS: The mental fatigue index correlated linearly with the depression score of the POMS (r = 0.212), standard deviation of normal to normal beats (r = 0.286), and square root of the mean differences of successive beat intervals (r = 0.207). Meanwhile, linear correlations with frequency-domain parameters of HRV such as total power, low frequency power, and high frequency power were also statistically significant. With the increase in the physical fatigue index, physiological signals such as SBP (r = 0.300), HR (r = 0.349), and BR (r = 0.266) increased linearly. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of postural stability can reflect the aggravation of mental and physical fatigue among cadet pilots, which provides a potential method for assessing fatigue level before flight tasks and preventing errors by pilots. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2018,Turkey,Development taxonomy of human risk factors for corporate sustainability in aviation sector,"<title>Development taxonomy of human risk factors for corporate sustainability in aviation sector</title> <abstract>Purpose: Contemporary management and strategy mean optimization of ingredient factors such as human factors, systems, operations and equipment. With system approach in management and strategy, human risk factor as input has considerable potential to change results as airworthiness in aviation management. The managers of aviation business also optimize their functions to act safe while making contribution to development in triple of sustainability as economic development and its sustainability; social development and its sustainability; and environmental development and its sustainability. Corporate sustainability can be accomplished via supporting workforce which is the human risk factor. To support (empowerment) workforce, researchers should identify human risk or error factors which are important to this research. The purpose of this study is to suggest holistic framework for working environment system of aircraft maintenance technicians (AMTs) within two respects such as human performance (ergonomics) and corporate performance (sustainability). The secondary purpose of this system is to develop human risk taxonomy by determining the factors affecting both human and work by taking ergonomic aspects in aviation. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a taxonomy of human risk factors for AMTs is developed. These human factors divided into groups and subfactors are obtained from an extensive literature review and experts’ opinions in the field of human performance in aviation. Taxonomy developed will be useful to both sharing and using corporate sources in sustainable way. Findings: Human risk factors can be considered or accepted as factors that cause human error. This may result in the optimum way to managing human risk factor via minimizing human-based error. Personality, hazardous attitudes, individual characteristics, physical/psychological condition of AMTs and corporate social responsibility factors are human-related risk variables in this study. The risks and error can be reduced by recognizing these factors and revealing their relation to ergonomic design. Originality/value: The results of this study are intended to constitute a guide for managers to manage risk factors and to take corrective and preventive actions for their maintenance operations. It is believed that this study is highly important for the aviation sector in terms of raising awareness or providing awareness for similar practices. As taxonomy of the risk factors contributes to the managing human error, corrective actions related to these factors must be taken by managers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.</abstract>"
2018,United States,Energy drink and nutritional supplement beliefs among naval aviation candidates,"<title>Energy drink and nutritional supplement beliefs among naval aviation candidates</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: The National Academy of Medicine called for increased research on nutritional supplement use among military members. Current research has suggested potential health risks posed by energy drink consumption. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of energy drink consumption and beliefs about nutritional supplements in a U.S. military population. METHODS: Data were collected by means of an anonymous 44-item survey that was administered to and completed by 302 naval aviation candidates (100% response rate) enrolled in aviation preflight indoctrination (API) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL. RESULTS: Bivariate correlations indicated a statistically significant relationship between beliefs regarding the safety of energy drinks, energy drink consumption frequency, and personal beliefs regarding supplements [r(202) = -0.23]. The negative correlational coefficient indicated an inverse relationship between favorable perceptions on supplements and energy drink consumption. DISCUSSION: This study assessed beliefs about the safety of nutritional supplements among API candidates and to examine if a relationship between nutritional supplement beliefs and energy drink consumption exists. Results indicated a significant inverse relationship between API candidates' beliefs regarding consumption frequency and safety of energy drinks as well as beliefs regarding supplement use. Results also suggested that the more positively an API candidate perceived nutritional supplements, the less frequently energy drinks were consumed. The findings of this study indicated a weak inverse relationship between the beliefs/use of energy drinks and beliefs regarding the effectiveness of nutritional supplement use among naval aviation candidates. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2018,Australia,The differential effect of sustained operations on psychomotor skills of helicopter pilots,"<title>The differential effect of sustained operations on psychomotor skills of helicopter pilots</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Flying a helicopter is a complex psychomotor skill requiring constant control inputs from pilots. A deterioration in psychomotor performance of a helicopter pilot may be detrimental to operational safety. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that psychomotor performance deteriorates over time during sustained operations and that the effect is more pronounced in the feet than the hands. The subjects were helicopter pilots conducting sustained multicrew offshore flight operations in a demanding environment. The remote flight operations involved constant workload in hot environmental conditions with complex operational tasking. METHODS: Over a period of 6 d 10 helicopter pilots were tested. At the completion of daily flying duties, a helicopter-specific screen-based compensatory tracking task measuring tracking accuracy (over a 5-min period) tested both hands and feet. Data were compared over time and tested for statistical significance for both deterioration and differential effect. RESULTS: A statistically significant deterioration of psychomotor performance was evident in the pilots over time for both hands and feet. There was also a statistically significant differential effect between the hands and the feet in terms of tracking accuracy. The hands recorded a 22.6% decrease in tracking accuracy, while the feet recorded a 39.9% decrease in tracking accuracy. DISCUSSION: The differential effect may be due to prioritization of limb movement by the motor cortex due to factors such as workload-induced cognitive fatigue. This may result in a greater reduction in performance in the feet than the hands, posing a significant risk to operational safety. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2018,United Kingdom - United States,Acute exposure to low-to-moderate carbon dioxide levels and submariner decision making,"<title>Acute exposure to low-to-moderate carbon dioxide levels and submariner decision making</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Submarines routinely operate with higher levels of ambient carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) (i.e., 2000 - 5000 ppm) than what is typically considered normal (i.e., 400 - 600 ppm). Although significant cognitive impairments are rarely reported at these elevated CO<inf>2</inf> levels, recent studies using the Strategic Management Simulation (SMS) test have found impairments in decision-making performance during acute CO<inf>2</inf> exposure at levels as low as 1000 ppm. This is a potential concern for submarine operations, as personnel regularly make mission-critical decisions that affect the safety and efficiency of the vessel and its crew while exposed to similar levels of CO<inf>2</inf>. The objective of this study was to determine if submariner decision-making performance is impacted by acute exposure to levels of CO<inf>2</inf> routinely present in the submarine atmosphere during sea patrols. METHODS: Using a subject-blinded balanced design, 36 submarine-qualified sailors were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 CO<inf>2</inf> exposure conditions (600, 2500, or 15,000 ppm). After a 45-min atmospheric acclimation period, participants completed an 80-min computer-administered SMS test as a measure of decision making. RESULTS: There were no significant differences for any of the nine SMS measures of decision making between the CO<inf>2</inf> exposure conditions. DISCUSSION: In contrast to recent research demonstrating cognitive deficits on the SMS test in students and professional-grade office workers, we were unable to replicate this effect in a submariner population-even with acute CO<inf>2</inf> exposures more than an order of magnitude greater than those used in previous studies that demonstrated such effects. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

2017,Poland,Coping and changes in arousal after exposure to +Gz load,"<title>Coping and changes in arousal after exposure to +Gz load</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Acceleration load causes several physiological changes that play important roles in pilot performance. One of the problems is determining individual factors responsible for the differences in changes in the level of central nervous system (CNS) arousal after exposure to acceleration loads. We were interested in whether the coping style and anxiety as a trait might differentiate the subjects in terms of reactions of the CNS to +G<inf>z</inf> load-related stress. METHODS: Examined were 31 male volunteers with ages between 23 and 30 yr. Measurements were obtained under controlled conditions before, during, and every 2 min up to 12 min after centrifugation. The study was conducted using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory. The value of Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold (CFFT) corresponded to the level of CNS arousal. RESULTS: Two significantly different trends of changes in CNS arousal were identified: class 1 (higher level of fatigue following +G<inf>z</inf> load) and class 2 (lower level of fatigue following +G<inf>z</inf> load). Significant differences were observed in CISS scores with Task-Oriented Coping value in class 1 (M = 65.94, SD = 5.47) being considerably greater than in class 2 (M = 62, SD = 4.37). For Emotion-Oriented and Distraction Coping, the mean value in class 1 (M = 29.53, SD = 7.72; M = 16.82, SD = 3.8) was significantly lower than in class 2 (M = 34.33, SD = 6.68; M = 19.42, SD = 3.4). DISCUSSION: The nature of the changes in CFFT values over time is associated with coping style. Coping styles are very valuable in the prediction of CNS arousal caused by exposure to +G<inf>z</inf> stress. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,China,Protective effects of emotional intelligence and proactive coping on civil pilots' mental health,"<title>Protective effects of emotional intelligence and proactive coping on civil pilots' mental health</title> <abstract>introduction: Pilots' mental health is an issue of crucial importance that may endanger flight safety. As such, it is of profound significance to address the question of what characteristics are protective of mental health among pilots. The present study aimed to explore the indirect effects of emotional intelligence (EI) on depression and anxiety via proactive coping, and examine the moderating role of previous flight experience (PFE) in the conditional indirect effect of EI on depression through proactive coping. methods: A cross-sectional regression design was used to measure EI (Trait Meta Mood Scale), proactive coping (Proactive Coping Scale), depression (The PHQ-9), and anxiety (The GAD-7) among 319 Chinese civil pilots from China Southern Airlines. Mediation and moderated mediation effects were explored using regression analyses and were confirmed by the bootstrapping approach. RESULTS: Pilots reported relatively low levels of depression (M = 0.39, SD = 0.24) and anxiety (M = 0.22, SD = 0.23). Married pilots had higher levels of depression (t = 2.46) and anxiety (t = 3.07) than single pilots. Proactive coping mediated the association between EI and depression (B = -0.25), as well as the relationship between EI and anxiety (B = -0.23). Moreover, conditional process analysis showed that PFE moderated the indirect effect of EI on depression through proactive coping (b<inf>3</inf> = 0.005), in which simple slope analysis showed a stronger mediating effect for pilots with more PFE (simple slope = -0.14). DISCUSSION: The results showed that EI and proactive coping had protective potential in the prevention of depression and anxiety. Implications for the promotion of mental health and diminishing depression and anxiety among pilots are discussed. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Normobaric hypoxia and submaximal exercise effects on running memory and mood state in women,"<title>Normobaric hypoxia and submaximal exercise effects on running memory and mood state in women</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: An acute bout of exercise can improve cognitive function in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. However, limited research supports the improvement of cognitive function and mood state in women. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hypoxia and exercise on working memory and mood state in women. METHODS: There were 15 healthy women (age = 22 ± 2 yr) who completed the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4 th Edition (ANAM), including the Running Memory Continuous Performance Task (RMCPT) and Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) in normoxia (21% O<inf>2</inf> ), at rest in normoxia and hypoxia (12.5% O<inf>2</inf> ), and during cycling exercise at 60% and 40% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> in hypoxia. RESULTS: RMCPT was not significantly impaired at 30 (100.3 ± 17.2) and 60 (96.6 ± 17.3) min rest in hypoxia compared to baseline in normoxia (97.0 ± 17.0). However, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (106.7 ± 20.8) at 60% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia. Following 30 ( - 89.4 ± 48.3) and 60 min of exposure to hypoxia ( - 79.8 ± 55.9) at rest, TMD was impaired compared with baseline ( - 107.1 ± 46.2). TMD was significantly improved during exercise (- 108.5 ± 42.7) at 40% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared with 30 min rest in hypoxia. Also, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (104.0 ± 19.1) at 60% V˙O <inf>2max</inf> compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia (96.6 ± 17.3). DISCUSSION: Hypoxia and an acute bout of exercise partially influence RMCPT and TMD. Furthermore, a moderate-intensity bout of exercise (60%) may be a more potent stimulant for improving cognitive function than low-intensity (40%) exercise. The present data should be considered by aeromedical personnel performing cognitive tasks in hypoxia. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Lebanon - United States,Relaxation with immersive natural scenes presented using virtual reality,"<title>Relaxation with immersive natural scenes presented using virtual reality</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood. METHODS: There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality. RESULTS: Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (20.59, 20.52, and 0.32 mS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline (Δ = 1.2 and Δ = 1.1 points), but the control scene did not (Δ = 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect (Δ = 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene (Δ = 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points). DISCUSSION: Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2017,Denmark - United States,"Individual traits, personal values, and conflict resolution in an isolated, confined, extreme environment","<title>Individual traits, personal values, and conflict resolution in an isolated, confined, extreme environment</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: The study of personality traits, personal values, and the emergence of conflicts within groups performing in an isolated, confined, and extreme environment (ICE) may provide insights helpful for the composition and support of space crews for long duration missions. METHODS: Studied pre/post and over the 2-yr period of the investigation were 10 Danish military personnel deployed to stations in Greenland on a 26-mo staggered rotation. Subjects completed the NEO PI-R, Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and Portrait Values Questionnaire, and participated in structured interviews. During deployment, questionnaires were completed biweekly and a cognitive function test once a month. RESULTS: Personality findings indicated a generally well-adjusted group, above average in positive personality traits [Conscientiousness T-score = 59.4 (11.41); Agreeableness T-score = 54.4 (9.36)] and boldness. Personal values of benevolence and self-direction were highly rated. The decision when to ""pick sides"" and intervene during disagreements between group members was viewed as an important component of conflict resolution. There were no changes in positive/negative affect or cognitive function over the annual light/dark cycle. DISCUSSION: The personal values of group members appear highly compatible for living in a small group ICE environment for an extended period. Disagreements between group members impact the functioning of the entire group, particularly in regard to decisions whether to support one of the individuals or let the argument run its course. Extended training in strategies for conflict resolution are needed in planning for future long duration missions to avoid fault lines forming within the group. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,United States,White matter integrity in high-altitude pilots exposed to hypobaria,"<title>White matter integrity in high-altitude pilots exposed to hypobaria</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Nonhypoxic hypobaric (low atmospheric pressure) occupational exposure, such as experienced by U.S. Air Force U-2 pilots and safety personnel operating inside altitude chambers, is associated with increased subcortical white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this discrete WMH change remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate that occupational exposure to nonhypoxic hypobaria is associated with altered white matter integrity as quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) measured using diffusion tensor imaging and relate these findings to WMH burden and neurocognitive ability. METHODS: There were 102 U-2 pilots and 114 age- and gender-controlled, health-matched controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. All pilots performed neurocognitive assessment. Whole-brain and tract-wise average FA values were compared between pilots and controls, followed by comparison within pilots separated into high and low WMH burden groups. Neurocognitive measurements were used to help interpret group difference in FA values. RESULTS: Pilots had significantly lower average FA values than controls (0.489/0.500, respectively). Regionally, pilots had higher FA values in the fronto-occipital tract where FA values positively correlated with visual-spatial performance scores (0.603/0.586, respectively). There was a trend for high burden pilots to have lower FA values than low burden pilots. DISCUSSION: Nonhypoxic hypobaric exposure is associated with significantly lower average FA in young, healthy U-2 pilots. This suggests that recurrent hypobaric exposure causes diffuse axonal injury in addition to focal white matter changes. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,China,Association of individual characteristics with teleoperation performance,"<title>Association of individual characteristics with teleoperation performance</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: A number of space activities (e.g., extravehicular astronaut rescue, cooperation in satellite services, space station supplies, and assembly) are implemented directly or assisted by remote robotic arms. Our study aimed to reveal those individual characteristics which could positively influence or even predict teleoperation performance of such a space robotic arm. METHODS: There were 64 male volunteers without robot operation experience recruited for the study. Their individual characteristics were assessed, including spatial cognitive ability, cognitive style, and personality traits. The experimental tasks were three abstracted teleoperation tasks of a simulated space robotic arm: point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance. Teleoperation performance was measured from two aspects: task performance (completion time, extra distance moved, operation slips) and safety performance (collisions, joint limitations reached). The Pearson coefficients between individual characteristics and teleoperation performance were examined along with performance prediction models. RESULTS: It was found that the subjects with relatively high mental rotation ability or low neuroticism had both better task and safety performance (|r|=0.212~0.381). Subjects with relatively high perspective taking ability or high agreeableness had better task performance (r=20.253; r=20.249). Imagery subjects performed better than verbal subjects regarding both task and safety performance (|r|=0.236~0.290). Compared with analytic subjects, wholist subjects had better safety performance (r=0.300). Additionally, extraverted subjects had better task performance (r=20.259), but worse safety performance (r=0.230). CONCLUSIONS: Those with high spatial cognitive ability, imagery and wholist cognitive style, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness were seen to have more advantages in working with the remote robotic arm. These results could be helpful to astronaut selection and training for space station missions. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,Australia - Belgium,Sustained military operations and cognitive performance,"<title>Sustained military operations and cognitive performance</title> <abstract>Introduction: Cognitive performance is crucial during military operations. It is suggested that impaired cognitive performance accounts for most of the accidents during training courses and actual battle. There is a need to define when soldiers ' operational readiness becomes impaired. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of sustained military operations (SUSOPS) on vigilance, reaction time, working memory, and reasoning in order to select good indicators for performance impairment. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using publicly accessible databases (IngentaConnect, PubMed, Science Direct, and Defense Technical Information Center online) that were screened until July 2015. Keywords were military, sustained operations, (cognitive) performance, soldier, and training. Results: Only 7 out of 589 studies met the inclusion criteria. Selected studies were difficult to compare due to different methodologies, cognitive tasks, and military courses. Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory were affected after only a few hours, showing severe impairment. They are linearly related to military stress up to 80 h of SUSOPS. These three indicators needed little recovery time to return to baseline levels. After more than 80 h of SUSOPS, no significant impairments of those indicators were observed. Reasoning becomes impaired after high stress levels of relatively short duration and can remain affected after more than 80 h of SUSOPS. Discussion: Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory are affected after only a few hours while little recovery time is needed. For reasoning to return to baseline values, longer recovery is needed than the time available during SUSOPS. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,United States,Depression prevalence and exposure to organophosphate esters in aircraft maintenance workers,"<title>Depression prevalence and exposure to organophosphate esters in aircraft maintenance workers</title> <abstract>INTRODUCTION: Previous studies found that aircraft maintenance workers may be exposed to organophosphates in hydraulic fluid and engine oil. Studies have also illustrated a link between long-term low-level organophosphate pesticide exposure and depression. METHODS: A questionnaire containing the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 depression screener was e-mailed to 52,080 aircraft maintenance workers (with N = 4801 complete responses) in a cross-sectional study to determine prevalence and severity of depression and descriptions of their occupational exposures. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between reported depression prevalence and severity in similar exposure groups in which aircraft maintenance workers were exposed or may have been exposed to organophosphate esters compared to similar exposure groups in which they were not exposed. However, a dichotomous measure of the prevalence of depression was significantly associated with self-reported exposure levels from low (OR: 1.21) to moderate (OR: 1.68) to high exposure (OR: 2.70) and with each exposure route including contact (OR: 1.68), inhalation (OR: 2.52), and ingestion (OR: 2.55). A self-reported four-level measure of depression severity was also associated with a self-reported four-level measure of exposure. DISCUSSION: Based on self-reported exposures and outcomes, an association is observed between organophosphate exposure and depression; however, we cannot assume that the associations we observed are causal because some workers may have been more likely to report exposure to organophosphate esters and also more likely to report depression. Future studies should consider using a larger sample size, better methods for characterizing crew chief exposures, and bioassays to measure dose rather than exposure. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2016,Israel,A novel treatment of fear of flying using a large virtual reality system,"<title>A novel treatment of fear of flying using a large virtual reality system</title> <abstract>Background: Fear of flying (FoF), a common phobia in the developed world, is usually treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, most efficiently when combined with exposure methods, e.g., virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). We evaluated FoF treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements simulating, e.g., takeoff, landing, and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli were also incorporated. Case Report: Three male patients with FoF underwent a clinical interview followed by three VRETs in the presence and with the guidance of a therapist. Scores on the Flight Anxiety Situation (FAS) and Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires were obtained on the first and fourth visits. Anxiety levels were assessed using the subjective units of distress (SUDs) scale during the exposure. All three subjects expressed satisfaction regarding the procedure and did not skip or avoid any of its stages. Consistent improvement was seen in the SUDs throughout the VRET session and across sessions, while patients ' scores on the FAS and FAM showed inconsistent trends. Two patients participated in actual flights in the months following the treatment, bringing 12 and 16 yr of avoidance to an end. Discussion: This VR-based treatment includes critical elements for exposure of flying experience beyond visual and auditory stimuli. The current case reports suggest VRET sessions may have a meaningful impact on anxiety levels, yet additional research seems warranted. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

2015,United States,Personnel selection influences on remotely piloted aircraft human-system integration,"<title>Personnel selection influences on remotely piloted aircraft human-system integration</title> <abstract>Introduction: Human-system integration (HSI) is a complex process used to design and develop systems that integrate human capabilities and limitations in an effective and affordable manner. Effective HSI incorporates several domains, including manpower, personnel and training, human factors, environment, safety, occupational health, habitability, survivability, logistics, intelligence, mobility, and command and control. To achieve effective HSI, the relationships among these domains must be considered. Although this integrated approach is well documented, there are many instances where it is not followed. Human factors engineers typically focus on system design with little attention to the skills, abilities, and other characteristics needed by human operators. When problems with fielded systems occur, additional training of personnel is developed and conducted. Personnel selection is seldom considered during the HSI process. Complex systems such as aviation require careful selection of the individuals who will interact with the system. Personnel selection is a two-stage process involving select-in and select-out procedures. Select-in procedures determine which candidates have the aptitude to profit from training and represent the best investment. Select-out procedures focus on medical qualification and determine who should not enter training for medical reasons. The current paper discusses the role of personnel selection in the HSI process in the context of remotely piloted aircraft systems. © 2015. Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2015,United States,Fearless temperament and overconfidence in an unsuccessful special forces polar expedition,"<title>Fearless temperament and overconfidence in an unsuccessful special forces polar expedition</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: Assessment of the influence of personality and decision processes on the performance of two-person expedition teams has application for the composition of small teams for planetary exploration and potentially responding to off-nominal situations. CASE REPORT: We studied a two-man Special Forces team with a goal of reaching the North Pole in the shortest amount of time. Both subjects had high scores on measures of leadership/dominance, fearlessness, and achievement, and low scores on harm avoidance (high risk-taking). Differences were noted on scales measuring empathy, agreeableness, extraversion, emotional regulation, and callousness. Individual differences in the primacy of personal values of tradition vs. pleasureseeking were evident. DISCUSSION: High dominance traits of both team members, incompatibility in other characteristics and values, and minimal pretraining had a significant impact on the decision to abort the trek because of severe frostbite suffered by one subject. Implications for dyads exploring the Mars surface are discussed. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

Because crewmembers are confined in an isolated environment, the aim of this study was to identify possible changes in the emotional states, group dynamics, displacement, and leadership of crewmembers during an 80-d isolation period. METHODS: The experiment was conducted in an analogue space station referred to as Lunar Palace 1 at Beihang University. In our experiment, all of the crewmembers completed a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire every week and two group climate scales questionnaires every 2 wk; specifically, a group environment scale and a work environment scale. RESULTS: There was no third-quarter phenomenon observed in Lunar Palace 1. However, fluctuations in the fatigue and autonomy subscales were observed. Significant displacement effects were observed when Group 3 was in the analogue. Leader support was positively correlated with the cohesion, expressiveness, and involvement of Group 3. However, leader control was not. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that time effects, displacement, and leadership roles can influence mood states and cohesion in isolated crew. These findings from Lunar Palace 1 are in agreement with those obtained from Mir and the International Space Station (ISS). © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2015,Canada - United States,Systolic array architecture for steerable multibeam VHF wave-digital RF apertures,"<title>Systolic array architecture for steerable multibeam VHF wave-digital RF apertures</title> <abstract>A 2-D massively parallel, high throughput, systolic array for a spatio-temporal wave-digital filter (WDF) architecture is proposed. RF receive mode aperture beam personalities are achieved using 2-D fan filters with dynamically steerable passband directions and fan angles. The wave-digital realization results in low sensitivity of the far-field beam to errors in filter coefficients due to fixed-point effects in the digital arithmetic hardware. A fixed-point design of the systolic-array architecture that eliminates overflow errors is described. The architecture is implemented in FPGA-prototype form and tested using MATLAB Simulink with Xilinx EDA tools. The verified digital design is ported to CMOS standard-cell technology to obtain the area and power costs as well as the operational frequency. The 45 nm CMOS synthesis, placement, and routing show overflow free maximum frequency of operation of 131.02 MHz for 1-passband fan filter and an estimated power consumption of 450.30 mW at DC supply voltage 1.1 V indicating potential applications in the VHF range. © 1965-2011 IEEE.</abstract>"
2014,United States,Consistency of the Relations of Cognitive Ability and Personality Traits to Pilot Training Performance,"<title>Consistency of the Relations of Cognitive Ability and Personality Traits to Pilot Training Performance</title> <abstract>The predictive validity of cognitive ability and personality traits was examined in large samples of U.S. Air Force pilot trainees. Criterion data were collected between 1995 and 2008 from 4 training bases across 3 training tracks. Analyses also examined consistency in pilot aptitude and training outcomes. Results were consistent with previous research indicating cognitive ability is the best predictor of pilot training performance. There were few differences across training tracks, bases, and years, and none was large. Overall, results illustrated the consistency of the quality of pilot trainees as assessed by cognitive ability and personality trait measures, and the consistency of these measures in predicting training performance over time. This consistency results in a more stable training system, enabling greater efficiency and effectiveness. © 2014, Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2014,Germany,Assessment of Social Competence for Pilot Selection,"<title>Assessment of Social Competence for Pilot Selection</title> <abstract>To ensure that pilots possess the necessary skills for effective teamwork during line operation, airlines have introduced various diagnostic methods into their selection procedures that are designed to assess the social competence of pilot applicants prior to employment. A validation study with N = 292 ab initio pilots for a major European airline is described, in which assessment center (AC) methods have been compared with questionnaires on social competence and personality. Results show moderate to high correlations between 2 social competence questionnaires and certain personality dimensions, although only 1 social competence questionnaire (the Social Skills Inventory [SSI]) confirms systematic common variance with the behavior-oriented assessments of related concepts in the AC. In addition to traditional selection procedures, the SSI could neither improve the prediction of applicants' overall performance in pilot selection nor did it show substantial intercorrelations with an external criterion in the pilot training. Therefore, social competence and personality questionnaires could serve as an additional component in the preselection, but might not replace the AC, which provides information about the behavioral component of social competence in real social interactions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2014,Australia - Canada,A Holistic View of Cockpit Performance: An Analysis of the Assessment Discourse of Flight Examiners,"<title>A Holistic View of Cockpit Performance: An Analysis of the Assessment Discourse of Flight Examiners</title> <abstract>What pilots do on the job frequently is analyzed in terms of individual skills and human factors. Performances often do not consist of separable skills but of a holistic event, which can be analyzed into irreducible, mutually constitutive moments. A discursive psychology approach was used to analyze the discourse of flight examiners, based on 7 extended interviews about performance aspects. This study shows that in the discourse of flight examiners, cockpit performance is presented holistically, even though it manifests itself in different ways. Six main discourse repertoires are identified in examiners' discourse about flight deck performance, each of which has between 3 and 5 identifiable subdimensions. Case studies show the connectedness and interdetermination of the 6 main repertoires for talking about what pilots do and how they do it. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2014,United States,Personality (and Psychopathology) Assessment in the Selection of Pilots,"<title>Personality (and Psychopathology) Assessment in the Selection of Pilots</title> <abstract>The assessment of personality when selecting flying personnel is a frequently misunderstood endeavor. This article conceptualizes the task as a two-step process composed of discrete activities: select-in, which uses psychological testing and other methods to measure traits that have been deemed desirable during a job task analysis, and select-out, which is a medical undertaking that is actually an assessment of psychopathology rather than strictly an assessment of personality. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 presents special challenges in U.S. civil aviation. Issues of response inflation and its mitigation are also considered. The unique challenges of personality disorders, particularly as an individual transitions from the military to the civil sector, are explored. Finally, an integrative approach, with one practitioner combining select-in and select-out methods, is discussed, as are the legal pitfalls of such an approach. © 2014 This article not subject to copyright law.</abstract>"
2014,United States,Early Identification of Unmanned Aircraft Pilots Using Measures of Personality and Aptitude,"<title>Early Identification of Unmanned Aircraft Pilots Using Measures of Personality and Aptitude</title> <abstract>This study evaluated the extent to which personality measures (Self-Description Inventory+) could improve prediction of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) training outcomes, beyond currently used cognitive, psychomotor, and aviation knowledge and experience predictors included in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Pilot Candidate Selection Method 2.0. Participants were 170 USAF officers with RPA Initial Flight Screening (RFS) outcomes and 110 USAF officers with RPA Instrument Qualification (RIQ) outcomes. Both RFS and RIQ emphasize development of skills traditionally required for manned aircraft pilots, also considered essential for USAF RPA pilots. Results showed significant negative relationships between the Big Five personality trait of Openness and several RPA training outcomes, and significant incremental variance explained by Openness beyond other predictors. Additionally, RFS and RIQ training outcomes were generally predicted by measures traditionally used for selection into manned aircraft pilot training courses and careers. Together, these findings suggest that personality, specifically Openness scores, and scores on traditional pilot selection measures, can serve as useful indicators in the early identification of RPA pilot talent. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2014,France,Personality traits of people attracted by parabolic flight,"<title>Personality traits of people attracted by parabolic flight</title> <abstract>Background: Studies have shown that members of expeditions in extreme environments differed on the basis of personality factors (e.g., they were highly competitive, higher on Extraversion and Conscientiousness) compared to the control population. In order to identify individuals who are likely to participate in extreme environments, the aim of the present study using parabolic flights was to compare the personality traits of voluntary participants (VP) in a weightlessness experiment with those of the general population (GP) (French norms). Methods: The personalities of 57 voluntary participants in a parabolic flights experiment were assessed using NEO-PI-R and Trait-Anxiety. Results: Our results show significant differences with the general population: 1) in Trait-Anxiety (GP =42.25±11.44 vs. VP 5 34.56±6.24) and in 3 out of 5 personality domains (Neuroticism GP =90.04±22.68 vs. VP 5 78.70±17.44, Extraversion GP =112.13±18.87 vs. VP 5 123.81±15.41, and Conscientiousness GP =109.23±22.30 vs. VP 5 124.47±19.03); and 2) in 14 out of 30 NEO-PI-R facets. Discussion: These findings indicate a specific personality profile for voluntary participants in parabolic flights and confirm that participants attracted to extreme environments differ compared to the normative population. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2013,Canada,Cognition at altitude: Impairment in executive and memory processes under hypoxic conditions,"<title>Cognition at altitude: Impairment in executive and memory processes under hypoxic conditions</title> <abstract>Background : The negative effect of hypoxia on cognitive function has been well described. However, less has been published regarding cognitive dysfunction resulting from hypoxia produced by exposure to different altitudes. Methods: We measured short-term and working memory capacity (Digit Span tasks), cognitive flexibility and selective attention (Word-Color Stroop Task), and executive functioning (Trailmaking A and B tests) at baseline and simulated altitudes equal to 17,500 ft (5334 m) and 25,000 ft (7620 m) in order to obtain more information about the role of altitude exposure on cognitive tasks important for optimal functioning in the aviation environment. Results: Behavioral observations indicated that hypoxia was induced at different simulated altitudes. Marked declines in cognitive performance were also observed for all tests at 25,000 ft, with scores indicating greater impairment in this condition relative to others. Subjects also showed greater impairment when scores obtained in the 17,500-ft condition were compared to baseline, although the effects were not as clearly defined relative to the 25,000 vs. baseline contrasts. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that electronic versions of these tests may be useful in screening for acute symptoms of hypoxia and could provide insight into how discrete cognitive processes become impaired with oxygen deprivation at various altitudes. Given that these tests also assess neuropsychological functioning, our results allow for inferences to be made about the effects of hypoxia on human brain functioning. © by the Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2013,United States,Cognitive function during lower body water immersion and post-immersion afterdrop,"<title>Cognitive function during lower body water immersion and post-immersion afterdrop</title> <abstract>Introduction: The physiological effects of immersion hypothermia and afterdrop are well-characterized, but the psychological effects are less clear. The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in cognitive function during and after lower body water immersion. Methods: On separate mornings, nine young healthy men participated in both neutral (35 ± 1°C) and cold (13 ± 1°C) water immersion. Subjects rested in neutral air for 30 min followed by 60 min water immersion to the iliac crest and 15 min of recovery in neutral air. Rectal temperature and mean skin temperature were continuously monitored. Metabolic rate, the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) were quantified at predetermined intervals. Results: During immersion in cold water, rectal temperature was reduced, but SCWT and POMS scores were unchanged relative to baseline. Despite the reduced rectal temperature, little to no shivering was observed during immersion and metabolic rate did not change. During recovery from cold immersion, rectal temperature was further reduced by; 0.5°C, shivering was noted, and metabolic rate increased. Coincident with this acute afterdrop, SCWT Color-Word performance (Δ = 2 4 ± 8 vs. 7 ± 6 correct responses) and Interference score (Δ = 2 2 ± 7 vs. 4 ± 8) was impaired relative to recovery from neutral immersion (i.e., when core temperature and metabolic rate did not change). Conclusion: These results suggest that recovery from lower body cold water immersion elicits the afterdrop phenomenon and shivering, which together impair selective attention as measured by the SCWT. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2013,Japan,An isolation and confinement facility for the selection of astronaut candidates,"<title>An isolation and confinement facility for the selection of astronaut candidates</title> <abstract>Background: In 2008, JAXA conducted its fifth astronaut candidate recruitment. The final stage involved 10 of 963 applicants undergoing the first and second examination stages based on physical checks, written tests, and interviews. The third (final) stage focused on evaluating the behavioral attitudes required for ISS crewmembers. Since it is difficult to assess these attitudes by paper testing or interview alone, JAXA has established an environment in which the assessors could observe the behavior of examinees on a continuous basis. Methods: The 10 examinees stayed in the isolation and confinement facility for 1 wk. During their stay, several group and personal tasks were assigned along with predetermined daily schedules covering aspects of leadership, teamwork ability, productivity (performance), and so on. Subsequently, psychologists, psychiatrists, and JAXA officials/managers experienced in practical human space development evaluated them. Results: During the confinement, no examinees showed any excessive character traits or psychopathologic behavior. Repeated observations led to a convergence of opinions among the experts. Three examinees ultimately passed this assessment and were assigned as new Japanese astronaut candidates. Discussion: This unique assessment enabled the assessors to conduct longitudinal evaluations, evaluations based on observing detailed behavior, and easy control of test conditions and safety. Although "" selection of the right stuff "" may differ among each space agency, this method offers the unique advantage of allowing experts in various fields to evaluate the competencies of examinees both synthetically and longitudinally. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

A major part of any SMS is creating a process for assessing risk. This paper is a case study of how one jet charter company selected a flight risk assessment tool (FRAT), trained their pilots and then analyzed close to 800 flights in order to set trigger points for assessment use, risk values that required management involvement, and risk values that required some sort of mitigation.

2013,United States,Predictive validity of pilot selection instruments for remotely piloted aircraft training outcome,"<title>Predictive validity of pilot selection instruments for remotely piloted aircraft training outcome</title> <abstract>Introduction: Demand for remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) support has increased dramatically over the last decade. Initial efforts to meet the demand focused on cross-training experienced manned aircraft pilots and funneling recent Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) graduates to RPA pilot training. This approach reduced the number of personnel available for manned airframes and is no longer sustainable. In 2009, the USAF established an RPA career field and the Undergraduate RPA Training (URT) course to train officers with no prior flying experience to be RPA pilots. URT selection methods are very similar to those for SUPT. Some important factors for URT applicants are medical flight screening and aptitude tests [Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) and Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM)]. The current study examined the predictive validity of the AFOQT pilot and PCSM composites for URT completion. Method: Subjects were 139 URT students with AFOQT and PCSM scores. The training criterion was URT pass/fail and the pass rate was 74.8%. Results: Both the AFOQT pilot (r 5 0.378) and PCSM (r 5 0.480) composites demonstrated good predictive validity. Discussion: No minimum qualifying PCSM score exists for URT. Had a minimum PCSM score of 25 been used, the pass rate would have been 80.2%; 12 more eliminees would have been screened out compared with the current AFOQT pilot minimum qualifying score of 25. Although current selection methods are effective, based on results of several RPA job/task analyses, the Air Force is examining the utility of other measures to supplement current methods. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2012,Brazil,Space and motion perception and discomfort in air travel,"<title>Space and motion perception and discomfort in air travel</title> <abstract>Introduction: The perception of comfort during air trips is determined by several factors. External factors like cabin design and environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure, noise, and vibration) interact with individual characteristics (anxiety traits, fear of fl ying, and personality) from arrival at the airport to landing at the destination. In this study, we investigated the infl uence of space and motion discomfort (SMD), fear of heights, and anxiety on comfort perception during all phases of air travel. Methods: We evaluated 51 frequent air travelers through a modifi ed version of the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (FAS), in which new items were added and where the subjects were asked to report their level of discomfort or anxiety (not fear) for each phase of air travel (Chronbach ' s alpha 5 0.974). Correlations were investigated among these scales: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Cohen ' s Acrophobia Questionnaire, and the Situational Characteristics Questionnaire (SitQ, designed to estimate SMD levels). Results: Scores of SitQ correlated with discomfort in situations involving space and movement perception (Pearson ' s rho 5 0.311), while discomfort was associated with cognitive mechanisms related to scores in the anxiety scales (Pearson ' s rho 5 0.375). Anxiety traits were important determinants of comfort perception before and after fl ight, while the infl uence of SMD was more signifi cant during the time spent in the aircraft cabin. Discussion: SMD seems to be an important modulator of comfort perception in air travel. Its infl uence on physical well being and probably on cognitive performance, with possible effects on fl ight safety, deserves further investigation. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2012,United States,"An independent, objective calibration check for the Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device","<title>An independent, objective calibration check for the Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device</title> <abstract>Introduction: Normobaric hypoxia, which does not entail an altitude chamber, but reduces the fraction of inspired oxygen (O <inf>2</inf> ) by diluting air with nitrogen, is finding increased use. The Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device (ROBD-2) is one of several commercial devices for generating such normobaric hypoxia. Reported here are results of a procedure to check the calibration of the ROBD-2 using methods that may be readily available in physiology and psychophysiology facilities. Methods: The %O <inf>2</inf> output by the ROBD-2 was measured concurrently in two ways for altitudes from mean sea level (MSL) to 34,000 ft above MSL at 2000-ft intervals five times over 2 d. One measurement method used was the one built into the ROBD-2, which reports the %O <inf>2</inf> the device is delivering at the selected target altitude. The other method diverted a sample of the ROBD-2 ' s output gas to the paramagnetic O <inf>2</inf> sensor of a metabolic measuring system via its sampling line. The %O <inf>2</inf> measured with the two techniques was compared using Bland-Altman statistical procedures. Results: The two measurement methods produced %O <inf>2</inf> readings differing by no more than 0.18% O <inf>2</inf> from MSL to 34,000 ft (from 20.95 to about 4.40% oxygen, respectively), the full operating range of the device. Calculating altitude from the measured %O <inf>2</inf> showed the ROBD-2 operated within its design error margins over its whole operational range. Discussion: The purpose for which the ROBD-2 is used should determine whether the reliability of its output in normobaric equiva lent altitude is adequate. Differences between devices and de vice sta bility over time and with use have yet to be assessed. Our assessment does not address the accuracy of the algorithm the ROBD-2 uses to provide an equivalent target altitude under normobaric conditions.

2012,Estonia,The essentials of defining adaptation,"<title>The essentials of defining adaptation</title> <abstract>The concept of adaptation has a considerable importance in many areas of research. Evolution theory is all about long-term adaptation, psychology is (among other things) interested in how people cope mentally with various changes in their life, business research tries to find ways to make companies survive and flourish in the ever more turbulent markets, armies rethink their strategies and become more flexible to be able to counter new threats, engineering disciplines move towards making systems better at reconfiguring and repairing themselves without costly and time-consuming human intervention, achieving sophisticated artificial life and artificial intelligence is in large part about finding out how to create systems that are highly adaptive and cope with the difficult and often unexpected situations they encounter, and so forth. When trying to understand, manage or create large complex systems, the issue of adaptivity almost always arises to the set of top concerns, even so much so that it has become quite common to use the term Complex Adaptive Systems when referring to the subject of research, management and design efforts in various fields that deal with systems consisting of large numbers of interacting components. © 2012 IEEE.</abstract>"
2011,India,Personality and motivational needs in Indian military pilots,"<title>Personality and motivational needs in Indian military pilots</title> <abstract>Research on cultural differences provides a different aspect of the attributes in pilots that might affect job performance. Basic attributes of personality and motivation are of importance for military aviators to maintain optimal personal effectiveness, flying proficiency and safety in aviation. Ninety military pilots were assessed on the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS), and the Revised Neuroticism Extraversion and Openness Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). The results of this study showed that Indian aircrew were lower on achievement, dominance, change and heterosexuality when compared to American aircrew. They were significantly higher on other needs such as affiliation, deference, order, succorance, abasement and nurturance. The results on the NEO-PI-R showed that the group was significantly higher on neuroticism and significantly lower on extraversion and conscientiousness. These cross cultural differences can be attributed to the collectivistic nature of Indian culture as opposed to the individualistic nature of American culture. The findings imply that cultural factors are likely to influence personality and motivation and that this issue needs to be taken into account during aircrew selection, training and clinical evaluation.</abstract>"
2011,France,Executive functions and pilot characteristics predict flight simulator performance in general aviation pilots,"<title>Executive functions and pilot characteristics predict flight simulator performance in general aviation pilots</title> <abstract>In general aviation, 85% of the crashes seem to be caused by pilots' errors (Li, Baker, Grabowski, & Rebok, 2001) and 46% of the crashes occur at airports (Li & Baker, 1999). It is important to determine if the same factors influence the flying performance and the landing decision making and to uncover which factors, among the pilot's cognitive status, personality traits, and experience, are the most predictive. We examined in 24 general aviation pilots the relationship between those factors and the flying performance and weather-related decision-making relevance. The cognitive assessment encompassed the three basic executive functions (Miyake et al., 2000), reasoning, and psychomotor velocity. The personal characteristics were age, flight experience, and level of impulsivity. Reasoning, updating in working memory, and flight experience were predictive of the flight performance. In addition, updating in working memory, flight experience, and level of impulsivity were linked with weather-related decision-making relevance. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2011,United Kingdom,Conceptions of cognition for cognitive engineering,"<title>Conceptions of cognition for cognitive engineering</title> <abstract>Cognitive processes, cognitive psychology tells us, unfold in our heads. In contrast, several approaches in cognitive engineering argue for a shift of unit of analysis from what is going on in the heads of operators to the workings of whole socio-technical systems. This shift is sometimes presented as part of the development of a new understanding of what cognition is and where the boundaries of cognitive systems are. Cognition, it is claimed, is not just situated or embedded, but extended and distributed in the world. My main question in this article is what the practical significance is of this framing of an expanded unit of analysis in a cognitive vocabulary. I focus on possible consequences for how cognitive engineering practitioners think about function allocation in system design, and on what the relative benefits and costs are of having a common framework and vocabulary for talking about both human and technical system components. I argue for what I call an expansive but deflated conception of cognition, primarily on pragmatic grounds. In addition, I claim that the important lesson of the ""boundaries of cognition"" debate in cognitive science is the negative claim that there is not anything special about the biological boundary of the skin and skull per se, rather than some positive claim about where the boundaries of extended or distributed cognitive systems really are. I also examine the role of the concept of cognition in the theoretical frameworks of distributed cognition, joint cognitive systems (also known as cognitive system engineering), and cognitive work analysis. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2010,China - Hong Kong,Chinese herbal medicine and cognitive and emotional functions during 60-day head-down bed rest,"<title>Chinese herbal medicine and cognitive and emotional functions during 60-day head-down bed rest</title> <abstract>Introduction: This study aimed to test the efficacy of an oral-intake Chinese herbal medicine in enhancing the cognitive and emotional functions of individuals in a simulated microgravity condition. The herbal medicine consisted of ingredients that may enhance cognitive and emotional functions in an extreme environment. Methods: There were 14 healthy male subjects who were randomly assigned to a Chinese medicine (CMG) or a control (CG) group and underwent a 60-d 6° head-down bed-rest protocol. Testing was conducted before (Day -3), throughout (Days 3, 7, 20, 40, 57), and after (Days +3, +10) the bedrest protocol. The Arrow Test, Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), Dual Task, and Affect Grid were administered on all testing days. Results: The CMG demonstrated consistently higher scores on the BART (Days 20 to 40; Mean: CMG, 43.0 to 46.2 and CG, 30.2 to 25.5) and lower levels of arousal on the Affect Grid (Days 7 to 40; Mean: CMG, 6.9 to 6.7 and CG, 8.1 to 8.0) than did the CG. The CMG showed significantly higher performance on the Arrow Test (incompatible condition) at the beginning of the bed-rest period (Day 3 to 7; Mean: 799.5 ms and 763.1 ms, respectively) which was not observed in the CG. Discussions: Results suggest that the Chinese herbal medicine may calm subjects' emotions by lowering the arousal level. At the same time, it may have produced positive effects in enhancing advantageous risk-taking and to a lesser extent self-regulatory behaviors (in the early phase).

2010,Canada - Netherlands - United States,Conflict-handling mode scores of three crews before and after a 264-day spaceflight simulation,"<title>Conflict-handling mode scores of three crews before and after a 264-day spaceflight simulation</title> <abstract>Introduction: In both the Russian and U.S. space programs, crew safety and mission success have at times been jeopardized by critical incidents related to psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal aspects of crew performance. The modes used for handling interpersonal conflict may play a key role in such situations. Methods: This study analyzed conflict-handling modes of three crews of four people each before and after a 264-d spaceflight simulation that was conducted in Russia in 1999-2000. Conflict was defined as a situation in which the concerns of two or more individuals appeared to be incompatible. Participants were assessed using the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, which uses 30 forced-choice items to produce scores for five modes of conflict handling. Results were compared to norms developed using managers at middle and upper levels of business and government. Results: Both before and after isolation, average scores for all crews were above 75% for Accommodating, below 25% for Collaborating, and within the middle 50% for Competing, Avoiding, and Compromising. Statistical analyses showed no significant difference between the crews and no statistically significant shift from pre- to post-isolation. Discussion: A crew predisposition to use Accommodating most and Collaborating least may be practical in experimental settings, but is less likely to be useful in resolving conflicts within or between crews on actual flights. Given that interpersonal conflicts exist in any environment, crews in future space missions might benefit from training in conflict management skills.

2009,United States,Personality traits in clinically referred aviators: Two clusters related to occupational suitability,"<title>Personality traits in clinically referred aviators: Two clusters related to occupational suitability</title> <abstract>Background: The Five Factor Model (FFM) of normal personality provides a compelling framework for investigating personality subtypes in large military populations. The FFM was used to determine whether a sample of clinically referred military aviators exhibited commonly occurring personality clusters. Methods: The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was used to evaluate 956 clinically referred U.S. Naval aviators and flight officers on the domains of neuroticism (N), extroversion (E), openness (O), agreeableness (A), and conscientiousness (C). The scores were subjected to model-based cluster analysis and emergent clusters were compared with respect to their scores and clinical outcomes. Results: A two-cluster model provided the best fit to the data. MANOVA indicated significant differences between the two cluster groups with respect to four of the five factors (N, E, A, and C). The greatest differences were for N and E, with the smaller group (Group 1, N 5 291) being significantly more neurotic and less extroverted than Group 2 (N 5 665). Cluster membership had more specificity (0.74) than sensitivity (0.59) for predicting adverse clinical outcome, with the probability of an adverse clinical outcome increasing from 0.14 to 0.28 for those in the neurotic and introverted Group 1. Conclusions: Elevated neuroticism and depressed extraversion were the defining traits of the personality cluster less suited for aviation duty (Group 1). Results support assessment of neuroticism and extroversion during clinical mental health evaluations related to military aviation duty.© by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Cognitive function during acute cold exposure with or without sleep deprivation lasting 53 hours,"<title>Cognitive function during acute cold exposure with or without sleep deprivation lasting 53 hours</title> <abstract>Introduction: Cold exposure and sleep deprivation are independently associated with transient cognitive impairment, including difficulty in attention, reaction time, and executive function. The possible interactive effects of cold exposure and sleep deprivation on cognition have not previously been examined. Methods: Six apparently healthy young adult men participated in a within-subjects design with two counterbalanced 53-h protocols: 2-h cold exposure (10°C) blocks every 24 h with normal sleep (Cold), and the same cold exposure in addition to 53 h of complete sleep deprivation (Cold + Sdep). Computerized cognitive tasks of attention, reaction time, and executive function were completed every 4 h during Cold + Sdep, and every 4 waking hours during Cold. Results: Cold was associated with a decline in attention over time (b = -0.06). Cold + Sdep was associated with greater attentional decline than Cold (b = -0.13), a significantly reduced speeded/reaction time performance (b = 0.02; b = -0.13), and a trend toward reduced cognitive inhibition over time (b = -0.10). Discussion: Findings suggest an additive effect of sleep deprivation to cold exposure in attention and reaction time, and a trend toward this pattern in aspects of executive functioning. These findings raise concern for errors when careful attention and speeded cognitive flexibility are necessary and optimal sleep and protection from the environment is not possible. Mechanisms are not entirely clear, but may be related to transient cerebrovascular or neurochemical changes, or direct physiological effects. Further work is needed to clarify mechanisms for the additive cognitive decline associated with cold exposure and sleep deprivation. Copyright © by the Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"

2009,United States,Behavioral and psychological issues in long-duration head-down bed rest,"<title>Behavioral and psychological issues in long-duration head-down bed rest</title> <abstract>Introduction: This report is one of a series on the Flight Analogs Project, which is designed to lay the groundwork for a standard bed rest protocol. Behavioral health services, similar to those offered to the U.S. astronauts who undertake 6-mo missions onboard the International Space Station, were provided to 13 long-duration head-down bed rest participants. Long-duration missions pose unique challenges and stressors, including separation from primary support group, monotonous environment, and loss of privacy and autonomy. Methods: The psychological services team, consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a master's level psychological support scientist, provided behavioral health services throughout all phases of the Flight Analogs Project (FAP) long-duration head-down bed rest study. During the initial screening phase, potential candidates completed 4 h of psychological testing and a 1.5-h clinical interview with a psychologist to assess their psychological fitness and ability to complete the study successfully. Additionally, the psychological services team provided pre-admission trainings on time management, stress management, and communication skills and conflict resolution. Throughout their stay on the research unit, study participants received regular individual and group visits from the psychological services team. Training was also provided to study personnel to address personality and behavioral management challenges. Results: Psychological support and training provided to both subjects and study personnel have successfully improved the well being of study participants. Discussion: Behavioral health services are indispensable to long-duration head-down bed rest studies. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Challenges in addressing graduate student impairment in academic professional psychology programs,"<title>Challenges in addressing graduate student impairment in academic professional psychology programs</title> <abstract>Given the prevalence of emotional and psychological problems among professional psychologists, a primary concern to the field is impairment, or problems of professional competence. Graduate students, in particular, are an especially vulnerable subpopulation of mental health care professionals. Despite graduate students' heightened risk of impairment, relatively little attention has been paid in the literature to the handling of impairment in graduate students in academic training programs. Recommendations for a proactive approach to addressing impairment in trainees are discussed with respect to students, supervisors, and training programs. As graduate school is the first major milestone in a therapist's development, psychologists as gatekeepers of the field of psychology must accept an ethical responsibility to appropriately monitor, acknowledge, and manage impairment among trainees. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,United States,Ethical considerations when working with older adults in psychology,"<title>Ethical considerations when working with older adults in psychology</title> <abstract>The growing number of older adults in America will result in an increasing demand for psychotherapists familiar with their psychological needs. To treat this population in an ethical manner, practitioners need to be aware of the unique characteristics of the aging process, especially in regards to age-related vulnerabilities, such as cognitive decline. Unfortunately, recent research has shown that those currently in practice do not have sufficient knowledge of the aging process and age specific issues of older adults. To address these deficits the American Psychological Association published a report outlining six general concepts: attitudes, general knowledge about adult development, clinical issues, assessment, intervention, and education. These concepts are described. Furthermore, this article extends the current thinking on ethical issues regarding older adults by addressing their vulnerabilities. In addition, ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, and elder abuse are addressed as they apply to both clinical and research situations. In addition, methods of resolving these important issues are suggested throughout the article. A depiction of the ethical issues of psychologists working with older adults is provided and practical procedures to help psychologists perform with high ethical standards of care for this age group are offered. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,United States,The ethics of psychology's role in politics and the development and institution of social policy,"<title>The ethics of psychology's role in politics and the development and institution of social policy</title> <abstract>The relationship between psychological research and the development of social policy is controversial, as is any discussion of the role of values and morals within science. Three particular instances of this controversy are evident in psychological research conducted on affirmative action, child abuse, and abortion. The American Psychological Association (APA) in fact takes a particular organizational stance on these issues. APA's Ethics Code provides some guidelines for dealing with issues of personal values as they impact psychological research and the development of social policy. An important distinction can be made between the issues psychological research can reasonably address using empirical data and the issues about which psychologists should take a stand. Ethical guidelines can help psychologists make this distinction as well as inform their subsequent actions. One pertinent recommendation is that psychologists, when serving in their professional role, should be clear regarding whether empiricism or personal belief is guiding their public statements. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2009,United States,Control of mobile robots using the soar cognitive architecture,"<title>Control of mobile robots using the soar cognitive architecture</title> <abstract>This paper describes the development of a system that uses computational psychology (the Soar cognitive architecture) for the control of unmanned vehicles. A multithreaded software system written using Java and integrated with the Soar cognitive architecture has been implemented on two types of mobile robots. Soar can be used as a general purpose robotic intelligence system and can handle a wide variety of sensor inputs and motor-control out-puts. The use of existing computational psychology methods (such as Soar) may be a more efficient approach to developing robotic software, rather than developing new software for every new unmanned vehicle application. Results from the application of this software system (named the cognitive robotic system, or CRS) to a practical unmanned ground vehicle mission, navigating to a target GPS location while avoiding obstacles, are described. The CRS has been designed so that its capabilities can be expanded in the future through the inclusion of additional sensors and motors, additional software systems, and more sophisticated Soar agents. © 2009 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

2008,Belgium,"Individual, work-, and flight-related issues in F-16 pilots reporting neck pain","<title>Individual, work-, and flight-related issues in F-16 pilots reporting neck pain</title> <abstract>Introduction: Neck pain is a common problem in F-16 pilots. A cross-sectional survey was used to determine the self-reported 1-yr prevalence of neck pain and to compare individual, work-related, and flight-related characteristics in F-16 pilots with and without neck pain. Method: There were 90 male F-16 pilots of the Belgian Air Force and The Royal Netherlands Air Force who voluntarily completed an anonymous survey. Resorts: The 1-yr prevalence of neck pain was 18.9%. Pilots were divided into two groups: healthy (HG) and neck pain group (NPG). This study could not identify individual or specific flight-related differences between these two groups. High force demands, often sitting for a long time, frequently holding the neck in a forward bent posture, and being physically tired were all physical work-related factors that were reported significantly more often in the NPG. The NPG also reported significantly more psychosocial factors, such as being mentally tired at the end of the day and being annoyed by others at the workplace. Discussion: Since the specific flight-related factors were not significantly different between the HG and the NPG, physical and psychosocial factors could have been important factors in the development or maintenance of neck pain in F-16 pilots. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight for the first time that, in addition to flight-related issues, other aspects must be considered in analyzing neck pain. These other aspects stress the importance of a broader approach when considering neck pain, even in this population that is exposed to very high loads during flight.

Methods: Participants were 103 men who participated in Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) over a 50-yr period from 1950 to 2000 representing the first 50 yr of ANARE and all positions and occupations included in Australian Antarctic expeditions. Participants completed self-report measures of personality, organizational culture, and subjective fit. Results: Results showed that those who described the culture as satisfaction-oriented (more friendly and participatory) reported better fit, increased satisfaction with their group membership, and less role conflict in terms of their work role. Results also showed a relationship between personality, perceptions of behavioral norms and expectations, and perceived fit. Specifically, openness and perceptions of station culture as satisfaction-oriented were identified as predictors of good fit with station life and culture. Conclusions: The implications of the results for Antarctic personnel selection and recruitment are discussed and the importance of further research in other analogous isolated, confined, and extreme settings is highlighted.

2007,United States,Perceived brightness of incandescent and LED aviation signal lights,"<title>Perceived brightness of incandescent and LED aviation signal lights</title> <abstract>Introduction: Aviation signal lights using light emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly perceived as brighter than those using incandescent sources, even at the same measured intensity. In general, saturated colors, like those produced by LEDs, appear brighter than less saturated lights, like those produced by incandescent sources. Methods: We describe a series of experiments quantifying the brightness of simulated blue, white, and green LED signal lights relative to incandescent signal lights of the same hue. Simulated signal lights and arrays were compared against dark and against dimly lighted backgrounds, and through simulated fog. Results: The results confirm that LED signal lights are brighter than incandescent signals at matched luminous intensities. Brightness relationships were unaffected by background light level, and by the number of signals viewed, but the simulated fog reduced the brightness difference between the incandescent and LED signal lights. Conclusions: The present results could not be accurately predicted by several previously published models of brightness appearance, probably because of differences in experimental conditions. We present a new model that can be used to predict signal light brightness for blue, white, and green signal colors. Except for very short-wavelength blue signal lights, the model was able to accurately predict the present brightness data as well as those from previously published independent experiments. This validation lends confidence to the generality of the model for predicting blue, white, and green signal light brightness, but different colors (e.g., yellow or red) remain to be tested and modeled using this approach.

Methods: Applicants were screened with the Selection of Antarctic Personnel battery (SOAP) consisting of nine well-known psychological instruments. The SOAP scores were not revealed to the BAS selection panel members, who based the selection on operational criteria, interview, and a general medical examination. The SOAP scores of those selected (n = 177) were further compared with station commanders' reports of winter adaptation (n = 140), and subjective health complaints (SHC) (n = 86). Results: There were no significant agreements between SOAP scores (n = 348) and those actually selected by the BAS panel (121 accepted, 227 not accepted) (Cohen's Kappas for inter-rater agreement < 0.20). Participants characterized as exceptionally well adapted by the station commanders had higher scores on Openness on the NEO-FFI (the ""Big Five"" personality inventory) [Odds Ratio (OR) = 5.2], and higher levels of Emotion-Focused Coping (OR = 2.7) and fewer SHC (OR = 0.3). Participants rated by station commanders as ""poor"" had higher levels of Defensive Hostility (OR = 4.2), and lower levels of Emotion-Focused Coping (OR = 0.3). Women had higher rates of success in service than men, but were less likely to be selected. Discussion and Conclusion: Adding a psychological test battery would improve the odds of selecting good performers, and reduce the odds of selecting poor performers.

2007,Canada,Thermal balance effects on vigilance during 2-hour exposures to -20°C,"<title>Thermal balance effects on vigilance during 2-hour exposures to -20°C</title> <abstract>Introduction: Human mental performance is markedly affected by environmental temperature, body temperature, body heat content, and comfort, but the effects of these different factors are not entirely clear. A liquid conditioning garment (LCG) can be used to manipulate these factors independently. We hypothesized that cold exposure (coldEX) has negative effects on vigilance which can be alleviated by increasing body heat content throughout or prior to coldEX. Methods: Subjects (n = 10) were tested for vigilance during a 130-min coldEX to -20°C while warmly clothed; a period of moderate exercise occurred at minutes 64-74. An LCG was used to provide heating either before coldEX (prior heating, PH) or throughout coldEX (heating, H); the control condition involved no heating (NH). Results: There were significant differences among conditions for rectal temperature (PH: 37.3 ± 0.26°C, H: 37.0 ± 0.24°C, NH: 37.05 ± 0.26°C) and mean skin temperature (PH: 33.85 ± 1.21°C, H: 35.11 ± 1.35°C, NH: 32.84 ± 0.65°C). Reaction time decreased significantly after the 45th minute of coldEX in H and NH. At the same time, signal detection criteria in all conditions demonstrated considerable alterations, indicating bias in favor of 'target-present' responses, which were associated with lower mean skin temperature and thermal comfort vote. PH was more effective than H and NH in preserving reaction time and response consistency. Relative to men, women demonstrated increased heat loss and more deteriorated vigilance and signal detection. Conclusion: Vigilance deteriorates in cold conditions within 45 min of exposure. Increasing body heat content prior to coldEX is efficacious in preserving vigilance performance during exposures lasting up to 2 h. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2007,Russian Federation - United States,Crewmember and mission control personnel interactions during international space station missions,"<title>Crewmember and mission control personnel interactions during international space station missions</title> <abstract>Introduction: Reports from astronauts and cosmonauts, studies from space analogue environments on Earth, and our previous research on the Mir Space Station have identified a number of psychosocial issues that can lead to problems during long-duration space missions. Three of these issues (time effects, displacement, leader role) were studied during a series of long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Methods: As in our previous Mir study, mood and group climate questions from the Profile of Mood States or POMS, the Group Environment Scale or GES, and the Work Environment Scale or WES were completed weekly by 17 ISS crewmembers (15 men, 2 women) in space and 128 American and Russian personnel in mission control. Results: The results did not support the presence of decrements in mood and group cohesion during the 2nd half of the missions or in any specific quarter. The results did support the predicted displacement of negative feelings to outside supervisors in both crew and mission control subjects on all six questionnaire subscales tested. Crewmembers related cohesion in their group to the support role of their commander. For mission control personnel, greater cohesion was linked to the support role as well as to the task role of their leader. Discussion: The findings from our previous study on the Mir Space Station were essentially replicated on board the ISS. The findings suggest a number of countermeasures for future on-orbit missions, some of which may not be relevant for expeditionary missions (e.g., to Mars).

This report focuses on personality factors and decisions on the ice, psychosocial effects on those left behind, and the family re-integration process. Method: Pre-expedition measures included the Multidimensional Personality Inventory (MPQ) and the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships (PAIR). Semi-structured interviews were conducted post-expedition and at a 4-mo follow-up. The PAIR was re-administered at the 4-mo follow-up. Results: Significant tension and lack of communication between the two expeditioners was reported in response to the leader's decision to terminate the expedition because of weather conditions and poor progress. The incompatibility of the personality traits and goals of the two expeditioners contributed to this tension. The wives provided positive social support to each other, although the support and concern of their community became stressful. For each couple, both positive and negative changes in partner relationship intimacy were evident at the 4-mo follow-up. There was little consistency between each spouse on the types of changes that occurred. Discussion: Greater attention to and planning for the re-integration process is suggested, with application for the return from other types of challenging endeavors.

2007,United States,"EEG correlates of task engagement and mental workload in vigilance, learning, and memory tasks","<title>EEG correlates of task engagement and mental workload in vigilance, learning, and memory tasks</title> <abstract>Introduction: The ability to continuously and unobtrusively monitor levels of task engagement and mental workload in an operational environment could be useful in identifying more accurate and efficient methods for humans to interact with technology. This information could also be used to optimize the design of safer, more efficient work environments that increase motivation and productivity. Methods: The present study explored the feasibility of monitoring electroencephalographic (EEG) indices of engagement and workload acquired unobtrusively and quantified during performance of cognitive tests. EEG was acquired from 80 healthy participants with a wireless sensor headset (F3-F4,C3-C4,Cz-POz,F3-Cz,Fz-C3,Fz-POz) during tasks including: multi-level forward/backward-digit-span, grid-recall, trails, mental-addition, 20-min 3-Choice Vigilance, and image-learning and memory tests. EEG metrics for engagement and workload were calculated for each 1-s of EEG. Results: Across participants, engagement but not workload decreased over the 20-min vigilance test. Engagement and workload were significantly increased during the encoding period of verbal and image-learning and memory tests when compared with the recognition/ recall period. Workload but not engagement increased linearly as level of difficulty increased in forward and backward-digit-span, grid-recall, and mental-addition tests. EEG measures correlated with both subjective and objective performance metrics. Discussion: These data in combination with previous studies suggest that EEG engagement reflects information-gathering, visual processing, and allocation of attention. EEG workload increases with increasing working memory load and during problem solving, integration of information, analytical reasoning, and may be more reflective of executive functions. Inspection of EEG on a second-by-second timescale revealed associations between workload and engagement levels when aligned with specific task events providing preliminary evidence that second-by-second classifications reflect parameters of task performance.

Particular emphasis is given to her performance on serial neuropsychological assessments while both on and off of the medication. Case Presentation: Each testing occasion included a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological functioning, coupled with a blinded flight evaluation by a standardization pilot. The first testing occasion was on day 6 of menses while the aviator was taking 25 mg sertraline PO QD. The second testing occasion was completed 1 mo later, on day 6 of menses, while off the sertraline. The aviator's performance was compared with normative data at each testing occasion, as well as for possible significant change between testing occasions. Discussion: An interpretation of this aviator's overall neuropsychological performance is discussed, with particular attention given to the potential cognitive effects of sertraline. In light of previously published aeromedical considerations related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use by aviators, the aeromedical considerations regarding this aviator's use of sertraline for PMDD are also highlighted.

2007,United States,Ready or not: Enhancing operational effectiveness through use of readiness measures,"<title>Ready or not: Enhancing operational effectiveness through use of readiness measures</title> <abstract>Current and future military operations require personnel to perform a multitude of mission tasks. Military personnel are required to execute these tasks, and to perform to high levels of expectation. Many of these tasks are complex and demand substantial cognitive readiness, which may optimize and enhance cognitive performance. Technologies are being developed to aid individual soldiers to successfully complete their missions; however, the proliferation of new technologies, coupled with the varying operational missions, make leveraging cognitive readiness a mandate for the achievement of military effectiveness and enhanced overall performance. It is important to have a militarily relevant psychological battery that can be used to assess each individual's cognitive capabilities and appraisals, factors that enhance military operational effectiveness. Assessing individual cognitive readiness becomes particularly important when researchers broaden their examinations of military effectiveness to assess team cognition, team behavior, and team effectiveness. We discuss the theoretical development and the components of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Readiness Assessment and Monitoring System (RAMS). Data from several studies are presented to illustrate the behavioral profiles of individuals in extreme operational environments. Data show how specific factors (e.g., personality, coping) contribute to performance in operational settings (e.g., command and control, chemical decontamination operations). Understanding the effect of cognitive readiness on overall military effectiveness not only has implications for selection, training, and system design, but also provides the basis for the proactive development and sustainment of optimal performance, both in individual soldiers, and in small teams or military units.

2007,United States,Skin temperature feedback optimizes microclimate cooling,"<title>Skin temperature feedback optimizes microclimate cooling</title> <abstract>Introduction: A novel pulsed cooling paradigm (PCskin) integrating mean skin temperature (T̄sk) feedback was compared with constant cooling (CC) or time-activated pulsed cooling (PC). Methods: Eight males exercised while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in a warm, dry environment (dry bulb temperature: 30°C; dew-point temperature: 11°C) in each of the tests. Treadmill exercise was performed (∼225 W·m-2) for 80 min. A liquid cooling garment (LCG) covered 72% of the body surface area. Core temperature (Tc), local skin temperatures, heart rate, inlet and outlet LCG perfusate temperatures, flow, and electrical power to the LCG and metabolic rate were measured during exercise. Results: At 75 min of exercise T̄sk was higher (33.9 ± 0.2°C) in PCskin, than in PC (33.1 ± 0.5°C) or CC (32.0 ± 0.6°C) and PC > CC. The changes in Tc and heart rate during the tests were not different. Tc at 75 min was not different among the cooling paradigms (37.6 ± 0.3°C in PCskin, 37.6 ± 0.2°C in PC and 37.6 ± 0.2°C in CC). Heart rate averaged 124 ± 10 bpm in PCskin, 120 ± 9 bpm in PC and 117 ± 9 bpm in CC. Total body insulation (°C·W-1·m-2) was significantly reduced in PCskin (0.020 ± 0.003) and PC (0.024 ± 0.004) from CC (0.029 ± 0.004). Electrical power in PCskin was reduced by 46% from CC and by 28% from PC. Discussion/Conclusion: Real-time T̄sk feedback to control cooling optimized LCG efficacy and reduced electrical power for cooling without significantly changing cardiovascular strain in exercising men wearing PPE.

2006,United States,The role of aeronautical adaptability in the disqualification of a military flyer,"<title>The role of aeronautical adaptability in the disqualification of a military flyer</title> <abstract>Introduction: Possessing a stable personality plays a critical role in crew coordination, mission completion, and safety of flight in aviation. Presented is a naval flight officer whose personality traits were a threat to these key tenets and ultimately warranted removal from flight status. Case Report: A naval flight officer was twice referred to Human Factors Boards (HFBs) after concerns were raised about her emotional stability in and out of the cockpit. Her history revealed multiple clinical presentations revealing personality characteristics that should have raised immediate concern about her aeronautical adaptability. Formal psychiatric evaluation after her second HFB confirmed the presence of personality traits incompatible with aviation duty, but not until she had served nearly 4 yr as an aviation officer. Discussion: Aeronautical adaptability is a U.S. Naval term used to describe an individual's ability to work successfully in the aviation environment. Naval aviation personnel are considered not aeronautically adaptable/adapted if diagnosed with a ""personality disorder or prominent personality traits that adversely affect flight safety, mission completion, or crew coordination."" The Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army endorse similar concepts. Except for the U.S. Navy definition, aeronautical adaptability does not include formal DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, and, thus, flight surgeons and aviation medical examiners often make difficult aeromedical dispositions based on vague and subjective criteria. Conclusions: Determining aeronautical adaptability is not a simple, solitary process. It requires heightened suspicion, continual surveillance of suspect aviators, and collaboration from aviation medical professionals to ensure aviation safety.

2006,Netherlands,Ultralight aviation accident factors and latent failures: A 66-case study,"<title>Ultralight aviation accident factors and latent failures: A 66-case study</title> <abstract>Introduction: Little research has been done on ultralight aviation accidents. A better understanding of accident factors allows for better development of preventive measures. This study analyzes ultralight accidents with respect to significant factors related to active and latent failures, as referred to in Reason's Swiss cheese model of human error. Methods: There were 66 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ultralight accident reports that were examined from 1985-2004. Contextual information about active and latent failures was identified, compiled, and cross-referenced with pilot, aircraft, and accident information for evidence of significant relationships. Results: Pilots with less than 40 make/model-specific flying hours were significantly more likely to crash fatally (χ2 = 9.07; p < 0.005; df = 1) than other pilots and/or because of losing control (χ2 = 7.24; p < 0.05; df = 1) than other accident causes. In contrast, pilots with 40 or more make/model-specific flying hours were significantly more likely to crash as a result of engine failure (χ2 = 9.33; p < 0.005; df = 1). Loss of control as an active failure was usually associated with such latent failures as strong winds and insufficient mission planning, while the engine failure accidents involved inadequate maintenance. Conclusion: In order to reduce accident prevalence, ultralight self-regulation organizations should focus on training in mission planning, aircraft familiarity, and proper maintenance procedures. Further research should concentrate on explaining the prevalence of the active and latent failures shown here and determining the effects of the FAA's new light sport aircraft category. © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"

2006,United Kingdom,Progress in the development of guidance strategies for the landing flare manoeuvre using tau-based parameters,"<title>Progress in the development of guidance strategies for the landing flare manoeuvre using tau-based parameters</title> <abstract>Purpose – To provide a progress report into research conducted to establish guidelines for the development of guidance vision aids. Design/methodology/approach – The first stage of the research is to establish a coherent engineering basis for the methods of (visual) motion perception and control to inform the design of pilot aids that will support flight in degraded visual conditions, particularly when close to the ground. The next stage will then be to construct and evaluate synthetic displays that recover the visual cues necessary to allow flight in degraded visual conditions for a range of manoeuvres using the flight simulation facilities at the University of Liverpool (UoL). The research is guided by tau (time to contact) theory from the field of ecological psychology. Findings – The closure of spatial gaps for a number of aircraft manoeuvres are presented in the tau domain. Analysis of the landing flare manoeuvre suggest that both a constant rate of change of tau strategy and an intrinsic tau-guidance strategy will yield benefits in terms of touchdown descent rate if presented as display symbology. Research limitations/implications – Results are presented from trials where only one professional pilot was used. Results from a wider population of pilots need to be analysed to ensure that the observed trends are generic. Practical implications – The reported results are being used in the next phase of the research project to inform the design of a guidance vision-aid for the flare manoeuvre. These displays will be tested in flight simulation trials. Originality/value – The research takes a theory of motion perception and applies it to aircraft guidance display technology. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited</abstract>"
2006,United States,"Seat vibration in military propeller aircraft: Characterization, exposure assessment, and mitigation","<title>Seat vibration in military propeller aircraft: Characterization, exposure assessment, and mitigation</title> <abstract>Introduction: There have been increasing reports of annoyance, fatigue, and even neck and back pain during prolonged operation of military propeller aircraft, where persistent multi-axis vibration occurs at higher frequencies beyond human whole-body resonance. This paper characterizes and assesses the higher frequency vibration transmitted to the occupants onboard these aircraft. Methods: Multi-axis accelerations were measured at the occupied seating surfaces onboard the WC/C-130J, C-130H3, and E-2C Hawkeye. The effects of the vibration were assessed in accordance with current international guidelines (ISO 2631-1:1997). The relative psychophysical effects of the frequency components and the effects of selected mitigation strategies were also investigated. Results: The accelerations associated with the blade passage frequency measured on the passenger seat pans located on the side of the fuselage near the propeller plane of the C-130J (102 Hz) and C-130H3 (68 Hz) were noteworthy (5.19 ± 1.72 ms-2 rms and 7.65 ± 0.71 ms-2 rms, respectively, in the lateral direction of the aircraft). The psychophysical results indicated that the higher frequency component would dominate the side passengers' perception of the vibration. Balancing the props significantly reduced the lower frequency propeller rotation vibration (17 Hz), but had little effect on the blade passage frequency vibration. Conclusions: The relationships among the frequency, vibration direction, and seat measurement sites were complex, challenging the development of seating systems and mitigation strategies. Psychophysical metrics could provide a tool for optimizing mitigation strategies, but the current international vibration standard may not provide optimum assessment methods for evaluating higher frequency operational exposures.

2005,United States,Sex differences in tolerance to visually-induced motion sickness,"<title>Sex differences in tolerance to visually-induced motion sickness</title> <abstract>Background: Women report a history of motion sickness (MS) about twice as frequently as men, but the results of experimental studies are equivocal. In the present investigation, we sought to replicate previous findings that women report a greater history of MS than men when interrogated with MS history questionnaires. We examined the hypothesis that those reporting that they are prone to MS are less likely to volunteer for MS provocative experiments than those who are MS resistant. Finally, using a subset of these participants, we exposed men and women, during two separate sessions, to visually elicited apparent motion, with and without voluntary head motion (pseudo-Coriolis stimulation), to examine any differences in MS elicited between these two groups on exposure to such motion stimulation. Method: Experiment 1 used a MS History Questionnaire, which included an opportunity for male and female participants to volunteer for ""psychology experiments"" in the coming semester. This instrument was used to determine effects of sex and volunteer status on motion sickness susceptibility (MSS). Experiment 2 involved exposing a subset of these participants to rotation of a vertically striped rotating drum under static and head movement conditions. Measures of vection and MS were recorded. Results: We found higher MSS scores in women vs. men, particularly when looking at participants who elected to volunteer. Women in the second experiment reported significantly more MS, but they exhibited less tolerance with head movement. No significant differences in vection were observed. Conclusions: The results indicate that laboratory manipulations that are more provocative of MS reveal reliable sex differences. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2005,United States,"Luminous efficiency and the measurement of daytime displays, signals, and visors","<title>Luminous efficiency and the measurement of daytime displays, signals, and visors</title> <abstract>Purpose: Measurements concerning the usability or safety of optical equipment are based on assumptions regarding luminous efficiency. The current luminous efficiency functions are derived from human sensitivity experiments taken at low light levels compared with the outdoor day-time environment. The amount of error induced by extrapolating from low light level data to high light level applications is not known. We sought to determine whether standard luminous efficiency curves CIE V(λ) and CIE Heterochromatic Brightness Matching are appropriate for measuring day-use optical equipment such as display phosphors, lasers, LEDs, and laser eye protection, which are becoming more common in aviation. Methods: Flicker photometry and successive heterochromatic brightness matching were used to measure changes in luminance efficiency functions with increasing levels (1, 10, 100, and 1000 ft.) of light adaptation. Results: Luminous efficiency was found to depend on both the method and the reference intensity with which the measurements were taken. For heterochromatic brightness matching, luminous efficiency increased for longer wavelengths as reference intensity increased. Peak luminous efficiency shifted from approximately 540 nm to greater than 600 nm with increasing intensity. Peak luminous efficiency was constant for flicker photometry across all intensities, but the function narrowed slightly at 100 fL. Conclusion: Luminous efficiency curves measured at high reference intensities are substantially different from the standard luminous efficiency functions. Caution should be used when measuring spectrally narrow and bright sources such as lasers and LEDs with a V(λ) corrected photometer because the measured luminance may correlate poorly with perceived brightness.</abstract>"
2005,France - Germany,Wrist vibration affects the production of finely graded forces,"<title>Wrist vibration affects the production of finely graded forces</title> <abstract>Introduction: It is still unclear how central commands and afferent feedback interact to produce finely graded forces. To explore this question, we experimentally degraded afferent responsiveness using wrist vibration. Methods: Subjects grasped an isometric joystick with their preferred hand and produced forces of different magnitudes and directions according to visually presented vectors. In one condition, the dorsal and palmar sides of the wrist were vibrated at 80 Hz to degrade proprioception; in another condition, the wrist was not vibrated. Results: Response magnitude averaged 2.46 kg of force (kgf) without, and decreased to 1.90 kgf with vibration. The coefficient of magnitude variation was vibration-independent and averaged 0.30 kgf. The directional error of responses and its standard deviation were also vibration-independent, averaging -2.6° and ± 17°, respectively. Subjects' maximum voluntary force was 9.77 kgf without, and decreased to 8.83 kgf with vibration. Conclusion: Our findings clearly indicate that afferent feedback plays a role in the production of finely graded forces, probably by facilitating descending motor commands.</abstract>"

Methods: The Profile of Mood States and measures of structural and functional social support were administered over an 8-mo period (March through October) to 13 winter-over crews from 5 nations operating research stations in the Antarctic: United States (3 crews, n = 77), Poland (3 crews, n = 40), Russia (3 crews, n = 34), China (3 crews, n = 40), and India (1 crew, n = 26). Results: Americans at South Pole Station reported significant in-creases in fatigue and anxiety and a significant decrease in vigor over the winter. During the same period, Russians at Vostok Station reported significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and confusion, and Indians at Maitri Station reported a significant decrease in anger. A significant decrease in social interaction with fellow crewmembers occurred at South Pole Station, Vostok Station, and Poland's Arctowski Station. Several differences were also observed between the five stations in correlations between mood scores and measures of structural and functional social support. An individualistic cultural orientation was significantly associated with low social support and low negative mood. Conclusion: Cultural background is associated with mood and social support as well as changes in these measures during the austral winter. Cultural differences in patterns of psychosocial adaptation must be considered in the formation and training of multinational crews for long duration missions in space.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Sopite symptoms in the optokinetic drum,"<title>Sopite symptoms in the optokinetic drum</title> <abstract>Introduction: Sopite syndrome is a disturbance caused by motion characterized by drowsiness and mood changes that may occur without the classic symptoms of motion sickness. Because sopite symptoms are often subtle, it is important to assess for their presence, and to distinguish true sopite symptoms from changes in mood and drowsiness that are due to non-motion related factors such as fatigue and boredom. We compared sopite symptoms in the optokinetic drum (OKD) with symptoms in a control condition in which the drum's motion cues were removed. Methods: There were 48 Introductory Psychology students who were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the rotating stripes group (RS) sat inside a drum lined with black and white stripes. The drum rotated at 5 rpm. The control group (Ctrl) sat inside the same drum without stripes or rotation. All participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at pre- and post-drum exposures. Results: The RS, but not the Ctrl, showed increases on all four MSAQ subscales (gastric, peripheral, central, sopite). The groups showed equivalent decreases in positive and negative affect. These findings show that some sopite-related symptoms were due specifically to the motion stimuli, while others could be attributed to non-motion aspects of the experimental situation. Discussion: The findings have implications for the use of control conditions in the study of sopite syndrome, and for methods of assessing the changes in mood and drowsiness that are the cardinal symptoms of sopite.</abstract>"
2004,Canada - United States,Caffeine restores engagement speed but not shooting precision following 22 h of active wakefulness,"<title>Caffeine restores engagement speed but not shooting precision following 22 h of active wakefulness</title> <abstract>Background: Current military missions occasionally require combat readiness of soldiers who might be experiencing a sustained period of activity without sleep. Strategies to overcome the debilitating effects of sleep deprivation include the ingestion of caffeine. Unknown is the efficacy of caffeine use on specific elements of target detection and marksmanship following a modest period of sustained wakefulness. Methods: There were 20 subjects (mean ± SD of 26.7 ± 7.2 yr of age, 179 ± 6 cm in height, and 84.5 ± 10.8 kg in weight) who participated in double-blind caffeine and placebo trials where each trial involved a 24-h control period (with sleep) followed by 22 h of mixed mental and physical activity with no sleep. At the end of this period, subjects engaged in a 1-h rifle-shooting task. Subjects ingested 400, 100, and 100 mg of caffeine or placebo at 7.5, 3, and 0 h, respectively, prior to shooting. Measures of shooting performance included target engagement time (between target appearance and firing), friend-foe discrimination, accuracy, and precision. Results: Most measures of performance were degraded in the placebo sleep-deprived condition, but only the target engagement time and the number of shots fired were restored by caffeine ingestion. Conclusions: These findings concur with other research involving different periods of sleep deprivation, and indicate that the cognitive component of the shooting task (i.e., target detection) can benefit from caffeine whereas the psychomotor component (marksmanship) does not. It appears that once the target is detected, the subject is sufficiently aroused to engage the target regardless of the subject's level of alertness prior to detection.</abstract>"
2004,Norway,Stress and coping in a week-long disabled submarine exercise,"<title>Stress and coping in a week-long disabled submarine exercise</title> <abstract>Background: Emotional stress could impair cognitive performance and decision-making in the initial period within a disabled submarine (SUBSUNK). The aim of the present study was to explore stress reactions over time in submarine crewmembers exposed to a simulated SUBSUNK trial. Methods: There were 18 Norwegian sailors who were confined within the front section of a conventional diesel-electric submarine for 6 d 18 h complying with emergency SUBSUNK procedures. Self-reported measures of habitual coping and personality hardiness were completed before the simulation, and measures of emotional stress symptoms and quality of life were assessed daily during the exercise and at 2 wk after the exercise. Results: A repeated measures analysis of variance showed that emotional stress symptoms declined [F (6,14) = 2.76, p < 0.05], while quality of life improved over time [F (6,14) = 4.00, p < 0.01] from the first day compared with subsequent days of the experiment. Personality hardiness was negatively associated with emotional stress (r = -0.52) and lower quality of life (r = -0.47), while avoidant coping was positively associated with lower quality of life (r = 0.53) in the first 24 h of the SUBSUNK situation (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the level of emotional stress was highest in the first 24-h period, and that the level of distress was related to scores on personality hardiness and personality traits. These data have possible implications for selection and healthcare of personnel, and also suggest that crews will benefit from external help especially in the first 24 h of emergency response techniques.</abstract>"
2004,United Kingdom,Why people 'freeze' in an emergency: Temporal and cognitive constraints on survival responses,"<title>Why people 'freeze' in an emergency: Temporal and cognitive constraints on survival responses</title> <abstract>Background: Many witnesses attest that victims of a disaster often perish despite reasonable possibilities for escaping because their behavior during the initial moments of the accident was inappropriate to the situation. Frequently witnesses report victims 'freezing' in the face of danger. Objective: The aim of this paper was to identify the possible factors underpinning 'freezing' behavior in disaster victims. Methods. Witness testimonies, survivor debriefings, and official inquiry reports from shipwreck and aircraft emergencies were analyzed for their behavioral content. Results: It was found that 'freezing' behavior was a frequently cited response by witnesses to a disaster. 'Freezing' causes evacuation delays which increase the danger, establishing a closed loop process and further extending evacuation delays. This behavior can be accounted for by considering the temporal constraints on cognitive information processing in a rapidly unfolding, real-time environment. Conclusion: Cognitive limitations help to explain why survival training works and why there is a need for a survival culture to be developed. They also highlight the need to understand the behavior of children under threat as being different from that of adults due to the different stages of their neurological and cognitive development. There are implications for the development of proactive, rather than passive, life support equipment.</abstract>"

2003,Sweden,Affective reactions to and preference for combinations of interior aircraft sound and vibration,"<title>Affective reactions to and preference for combinations of interior aircraft sound and vibration</title> <abstract>Affective reactions to the interior aircraft environment are a basic constituent of perceived ride quality. This study addresses affective reactions to combinations of interior aircraft sound and vibration. In agreement with findings from environmental psychology, it was found that the combinations of six interior aircraft sounds and vibrations (no vibration, 16 Hz, and 95 Hz) gave rise to affective reactions described by two dimension s: valence (unpleasantness - pleasantness) and activation (activated - deactivated). Moreover, preferences for the affective reactions induced by the sound - vibration combinations were related to both of the affect dimensions. Taken together, these findings suggests that (a) different combinations of sound and vibration induce different affective state and (b) by measuring preference in addition to affective reactions, ride quality optimization may be facilitated.</abstract>"

2002,Germany,Speed-accuracy trade-off of grasping movements during microgravity,"<title>Speed-accuracy trade-off of grasping movements during microgravity</title> <abstract>Background: Earthbound studies have shown that for pointing movements there is a specific relationship between movement speed, amplitude, and accuracy that is known as Fitts' law. We investigated the validity of Fitts' law for grasping movements in normal and microgravity. Method: Subjects performed grasping movements toward virtual targets under three different time constraint conditions before and during exposure to microgravity in parabolic flights. Results: The ""speed-accuracy trade-off"" phenomenon was observed for the grasp component of prehension movements. The results were quantitatively similar in normal and microgravity such that increasing the speed resulted in a diminished accuracy. Conclusions: Fitts' law is partially valid for grasping movements toward virtual targets without visual feedback of the hand in normal gravity. In a microgravity environment, performance of grasping movements also follows some of the predictions of Fitts' law.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Conscientiousness and work performance while suffering from acute mountain sickness: A case report,"<title>Conscientiousness and work performance while suffering from acute mountain sickness: A case report</title> <abstract>A 52-yr-old male scientist who participated in a geophysical survey in Antarctica from a field camp located at 3538 m (11,600 ft) experienced specific symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) by Mission Day 9, and full syndrome AMS by Mission Day 12. He was treated at the field camp and evacuated to sea level on the next available flight (Mission Day 15). The concerns of this highly conscientious individual that initial signs of illness, such as fatigue with exertion, could be misinterpreted by others as poor work performance are described. The report focuses on individual personality and group processes that could lead to nondisclosure of symptoms, and the need, particularly in long-duration missions in which evacuation is difficult or impossible, to sensitize personnel to the importance of recognizing and reporting potential health problems.</abstract>"
2002,Japan,Psychological changes and group dynamics during confinement in an isolated environment,"<title>Psychological changes and group dynamics during confinement in an isolated environment</title> <abstract>Purpose: Cultural and personal traits will become important as the number of short-duration spaceflights of international crews supporting the International Space Station (ISS) increases and more people begin staying aboard ISS for longer durations. This project investigated the interpersonal and personal changes of Japanese subjects during a 1-wk stay in the Japanese Experiment Module. The Gießen Test (GT) was used to determine if the cultural background and personality traits of the subjects become more explicit and stronger during isolation. Methods: Six males and two females aged 22-28 yr participated in the study. They stayed 7 d in the isolation chamber at the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). The GT was chosen as an individual and group diagnostic instrument; it was administrated four times during, and one time after, isolation. Results: According to the GT-self-picture, subjects exhibited a change toward negative social resonance and social withdrawal. Subgroups formed but caused no isolation or tension. The GT-foreign-pictures showed that the judgment of other subjects changed toward hedonic and permeability directions. The common interpersonal relationships of the Japanese subjects influenced the group dynamics. These relationships tend to be integrative and tend to support the network and value systems, emphasizing connectedness and minimizing differences. Conclusion: The cultural background became more explicit and stronger during isolation. Based on this, isolation studies with international crews and intercultural training will be necessary for international crews performing both short- and long-duration missions.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Evaluation of flexible cloth electrodes for electrodermal activity recording,"<title>Evaluation of flexible cloth electrodes for electrodermal activity recording</title> <abstract>Background: Instrument selection for recording physiological data in flight studies requires careful attention to subject comfort and non-interference with aircrew activities. Several electrode types and recording sites may be used to examine electrodermal activity (EDA). Placement of electrodes on the foot minimizes interference with physical activity and reduces motion artifacts; however, use of conventional, hard-plastic-encased metal (PEM) electrodes within a flight boot can produce discomfort and pressure-induced artifacts. Hypothesis: When applied with proper electrolyte gels, thin, flexible, silver-impregnated cloth electrodes should acquire EDA signals qualitatively similar to those acquired using conventional, PEM electrodes. Methods: EDA responses evoked by light flashes, auditory stimuli and valsalva maneuvers were recorded with cloth and PEM electrodes simultaneously from both feet of 4 male subjects. Performance of cloth vs. PEM electrodes and variability of signals recorded with the same electrode type were examined by placing pairs of selected electrodes on each foot of the subjects. Placements were balanced with respect to age and handedness of the subject and the number of trials with each electrode type placed on the left or right foot. Results: Qualitatively similar signals were recorded with cloth and PEM electrodes. Cloth electrodes showed more variability between electrodes of the same type. Conclusion: For EDA recording, cloth electrodes can perform at least as well as PEM electrodes, making it practical to take advantage of the cloth electrodes' flexibility and lower profile.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Crewmember and ground personnel interactions over time during Shuttle/Mir space missions,"<title>Crewmember and ground personnel interactions over time during Shuttle/Mir space missions</title> <abstract>Background: Anecdotal reports from space and results from simulation studies on Earth have suggested that space crewmembers may experience decrements in their mood and interpersonal environment during the 2nd hall of the mission and that negative emotions may be displaced to outside monitoring personnel. Methods: To evaluate these issues, we studied 5 American astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42 American and 16 Russian mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir space program. Subjects completed questions from the Profile of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale (GES), and the Work Environment Scale (WES) on a weekly basis during the missions. Subscale scores from these measures were analyzed using a piecewise linear regression approach that analyzed normally distributed subscales using a mixed model and non-normally distributed subscales by dichotomizing the variables and using a generalized estimating equation. Results: After protecting against possible Type I errors due to multiple significance tests, only weak support was found for the biphasic model: the only significant findings in favor of the hypothesized 2nd hall decrements in the interpersonal environment were in crewmember GES Leader Support and astronaut WES Work Pressure. Strongly consistent confirmation was found on all six tested measures for the hypothesized displacement of tension and dysphoria from crewmembers to mission control personnel. The hypothesized displacement of tension and dysphoria from mission control personnel to management was found on five of the six tested measures. Conclusions: The absence of moderate to strong support for the biphasic model suggests that crewmember interpersonal functioning does not depend appreciably on 1st half/2nd hall time effects. The consistent support found for the displacement of tension and dysphoria suggests that countermeasures need to be developed to deal with this phenomenon in both crewmembers and mission control personnel.</abstract>"
2001,France,"Personality factors, stoicism and motivation in subjects under hypoxic stress in extreme environments","<title>Personality factors, stoicism and motivation in subjects under hypoxic stress in extreme environments</title> <abstract>Previous studies on the physiological and psychological adaptation of subjects to survival conditions involving high-altitude hypoxia (>6500 m) have shown that personality factors are important in this adaptation. We, therefore, proposed personality traits assessments in two groups of subjects engaged in sporting activities under extreme hypoxic environmental conditions: a group of mountaineers at high altitudes (>5500 m) and a group of free-lung divers at great depths (<30-60 m). These subjects were compared with two control groups: a group of subjects practicing no sport and another one practicing various compeitive athletic activities involving speed constraints. The personality traits assessed concerned mainly the subjects' attitudes and their propensities to act out their feelings and fantasies; they were assessed using projective procedures, the Hand Test and Clark's Situational Pain Questionnaire based on the Sensory Decision Theory. Subjects trained in mountaineering and free-lung diving under extreme environmental conditions displayed a high degree of stoicism. These individuals shared some personality traits with other sportsmen, particularly aggressive tendencies and introversion although not to an extent which interfered with normal interpersonal relationships. However, at least when practicing these extreme sports, the subjects did retreat from society. One of our questions concerns the grounds for this social withdrawal, that is, whether it derives from a inner compulsion founded on personality factors or if it is merely an artifact of our perceptions of the subjects, created by the confluence of the individualistic nature of these sports and the extreme environments in which they are performed.</abstract>"
2000,,Behavioral science: A progress report,"<title>Behavioral science: A progress report</title> <abstract>A prominent neuroscientist has recently observed that `More may have been learned about the brain and the mind in the 1990s... than during the entire previous history of psychology and neuroscience'. This wonderful progress, which should continue at an exponentially increasing pace as we move into the 21st century, sets the stage for another revolution - in the scientific formulation of intentional behavior. Just as applied sciences such as fluid mechanics and solid-state electronics benefitted from breakthroughs in physics, so it may be expected that social psychology and economics, for example, will similarly benefit from our expanding knowledge of psychosomatic and psychological function. Economics, however, with its basic concepts dating from the nineteenth century, must endure an extensive renewal. Toward this end, a new mathematical theory of behavior was formulated in the early 1990s based on the contributions of prominent psychologists and economists over the past two centuries. Presentation of the new approach at international conferences continued in 2000 with attention moving beyond the fundamentals into macroeconomic concerns including business cycles, productivity, and unemployment.</abstract>"

Three different personality types for captains were classified based on a previous cluster analysis (3). Crews were comprised of three crewmembers: captain, first officer, and second officer/flight engineer. A total of 72 pilots completed a 1.5-d full-mission simulation of airline operations including emergency situations in the Ames Manned Vehicle System Research Facility B-727 simulator. Crewmembers were tested for perceived stress on four dimensions of the NASA Task Load Index after each of five flight legs. Crews were divided into three groups based on rankings from combined error and rating scores. High performance crews (who committed the least errors in flight) reported experiencing less stress in simulated flight than either low or medium crews. When comparing crew positions for perceived stress over all the simulated flights no significant differences were found. However, the crews led by the 'Right Stuff' (e.g., active, warm, confident, competitive, and preferring excellence and challenges) personality type captains typically reported less stress than crewmembers led by other personality types.</abstract>"
2000,United States,"Summary of research issues in personal, interpersonal, and group dynamics","<title>Summary of research issues in personal, interpersonal, and group dynamics</title> <abstract>People working on space missions, whether they are crewmembers or Mission Control personnel, must interact in groups. Consequently, it is important to consider interpersonal and group dynamic issues to assure that mission goals are accomplished. Simulation studies on Earth and anecdotal reports from space have described a number of such issues that include crew heterogeneity, culture and language variations, leadership roles, and personality differences. Problems that can result include increased group tension, decreased cohesion, subgrouping, scapegoating, miscommunication, role confusion, and displacement of tension and dysphoria from one group to another. The three papers by Drs. Caldwell, Kanas, and Stuster that are presented in this session address some of these issues at the group level. They suggest three critical questions related to: 1) improving communication between space crews and Mission Control personnel; 2) dealing with emotional and interpersonal decrements during the second half of space missions; and 3) minimizing the effects of culture and language differences. These questions in turn lead to six research strategies related to: 1) developing and testing new technologies to enhance crew-ground communication; 2) developing tools to recognize important communication themes and the factors that affect them over time; 3) studying the ability of voice analysis technology to detect on-board interpersonal stress; 4) developing and testing countermeasures to deal with second half emotional and interpersonal decrements; 5) studying the effects of cultural and language differences on crew tension, cohesion, and performance; and 6) studying the effects of crew heterogeneity and size on crew tension, cohesion, and performance.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Predictors of behavior and performance in extreme environments: The antarctic space analogue program,"<title>Predictors of behavior and performance in extreme environments: The antarctic space analogue program</title> <abstract>Background: To determine which, if any, characteristics should be incorporated into a select-in approach to screening personnel for long- duration spaceflight, we examined the influence of crewmember social/demographic characteristics, personality traits, interpersonal needs, and characteristics of station physical environments on performance measures in 657 American men who spent an austral winter in Antarctica between 1963 and 1974. Methods: During screening, subjects completed a Personal History Questionnaire which obtained information on social and demographic characteristics, the Deep Freeze Opinion Survey which assessed 5 different personality traits, and the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation- Behavior (FIRO-B) Scale which measured 6 dimensions of interpersonal needs. Station environment included measures of crew size and severity of physical environment. Performance was assessed on the basis of combined peer- supervisor evaluations of overall performance, peer nominations of fellow crewmembers who made ideal winter-over candidates, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Results: Social/demographic characteristics, personality traits, interpersonal needS, and characteristics of station environments collectively accounted for 9-17% of the variance in performance measures. The following characteristics were significant independent predictors of more than one performance measure: military service, low levels of neuroticism, extraversion and conscientiousness, and a low desire for affection from others. Conclusions: These results represent an important first step in the development of select-in criteria for personnel on long-duration missions in space and other extreme environments. These criteria must take into consideration the characteristics of the environment and the limitations they place on meeting needs for interpersonal relations and task performance, as well as the characteristics of the individuals and groups who live and work in these environments.</abstract>"

More recently, the aviation community has become increasingly aware that successful completion of a flight or mission requires not only flying skills but the ability to work well in a crew situation. This project involved development and validation of a crew resource management (CRM) skills test for Air Force transport pilots. A significant relation was found between the CRM skills test and behavior-based ratings of aircraft commander CRM performance, and the implications of these findings for CRM-based selection and training are discussed.</abstract>"
1999,United States,The retention of adaptation to motion sickness eliciting stimulation,"<title>The retention of adaptation to motion sickness eliciting stimulation</title> <abstract>Purpose: This study compared the retention of adaptation to motion sickness eliciting stimulation after 1 mo and 1 yr. Method: A total of 34 subjects who developed nausea to an optokinetic rotating drum in a preliminary session repeatedly viewed the same rotation with an interval of 48 h between sessions until they had no feelings of nausea. For each session, subjects' electrogastrograms (EGGs) at 4-9 cycles per minute (cpm) were also recorded as a physiological index of the severity of motion sickness. Subjects were re-exposed to the optokinetic drum either after 1 mo or 1 yr. Results: The mean ratings of nausea for the subjects who were re-exposed to the optokinetic drum after 1 mo were 9.23 for the initial exposure and 0.94 for the re-exposure session. EGG indicators of motion sickness were 6.65 for the initial exposure and 1.03 for the re-exposure session. The mean ratings of nausea for the subjects who were re-exposed to the optokinetic drum after 1 yr were 8.94 for the initial exposure and 6.88 for the re-exposure session. EGG indicators of motion sickness were 5.97 for the initial exposure and 4.05 for the re-exposure session. Conclusion: These results indicated that adaptation to the motion sickness eliciting stimulation of optokinetic rotation is almost completely retained for 1 mo and partially retained for 1 yr.</abstract>"
1999,,Industry Application of Behavioral Science,"<title>Industry Application of Behavioral Science</title> <abstract>One of the more significant errors in the history of science occurred during the ""marginal revolution"" in economics near the end of the nineteenth century. Rather than explicitly recognize in basic theory that the happiness we seek to maximize in life originates within oneself, the early theorists formulated their equations as though human satisfaction resided in external things - as in so much utility (economist's term for satisfaction) per pound of sugar. Over the past 125 years, economists have developed mainstream mathematical economics on this incorrect basis resulting in the ill-founded neoclassical Equilibrium Theory. Because of this error economic theory is fundamentally timeless. The present theory, in its canonical form, corrects the early marginalist's error by identifying utility (time-integrated pleasure) exclusively with the stream-of-consciousness attending (expected) mental and physical activity. Time is now explicit in basic theory, thereby allowing, for the first time, the substantive computer-modeling of time-dependent, small- and large-scale economic systems. Furthermore, this new approach is methodologically compatible with mainstream sociology and institutional economics, allowing increased interdisciplinary cooperation that may influence policy -and thereby affect industry and markets. And safety engineering stands to benefit from the accommodation of neuropsychology in understanding human error in the supervision and control of technology.</abstract>"
1998,Canada,Evidence that the slowing caused by acute hypoxia is modality dependent,"<title>Evidence that the slowing caused by acute hypoxia is modality dependent</title> <abstract>Background: AFM (Additive Factors Method) experiments conducted with visual stimuli suggest that the slowing produced by acute hypoxia is located at the earliest preprocessing stage of information processing and that later stages are unaffected (the bottleneck hypothesis). Methods: To determine the contribution of degraded visual functioning to slowing, we bypassed this modality and measured reaction time in an AFM paradigm to auditory (Experiment 1) and kinesthetic (Experiment 2) stimuli. In both experiments hypoxia was induced with low oxygen mixtures and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO<inf>2</inf>) was controlled at 65%. Task difficulty was manipulated in Experiment 1 with tones that differed in intensity and in Experiment 2 with lifted cylinders that differed in weight. Results: The results for Experiment 1 showed an interaction between task difficulty and hypoxia, indicating slowing of the preprocessing stage. Slowing was not found in Experiment 2. The absence of slowing in Experiment 2 is surprising and indicates that slowing may be confined to vision and audition and may not involve later, more central, stages. We discuss the need to measure cerebral oxygenation in order to understand the sharp differences between the the bottleneck hypothesis, developed by controlling SaO<inf>2</inf>, and the more traditional behavioral model which postulates multiple cognitive deficits.</abstract>"

A promising method of investigating such interactions is based on the Kelly repertory grid technique. Hypotheses: We predicted that in a space simulation crew: 1) one's personal self-concept would become closer to concepts about other-crew members in a cohesive crew, and vice-versa, and 2) the at person's position in the group. Method: Crews from two isolation studies lasting 135 and 90 days at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow were evaluated using a modification of the Kelly repertory grid technique. Members assessed each other on a monthly basis and during off-nominal simulated docking periods. Results: During both isolations, crew members were unsuccessful in making their personal self- concepts move closer to their concepts about fellow crew members. Crew disintegration resulted, with one member becoming an outsider whose personality was characterized by a disintegrated ego-image and an infantile type of the present ego. Conclusions: In small isolated groups, failure to make personal self-concepts become mote like concepts about other crew members can lead to group disintegration and tension and can result in the appearance of an outsider who has a disintegrated ego-image and an infantile present ego.</abstract>"
1998,Japan,"Psychological studies of a Japanese winter-over group at Asuka Station, Antarctica","<title>Psychological studies of a Japanese winter-over group at Asuka Station, Antarctica</title> <abstract>In order to understand the psychological effects of Antarctic isolation and confinement on Japanese expeditioners, psychological studies were done on eight members of a wintering-over party at Asuka Station between December 1990 and February 1992. Mean age of the subjects was 34.8 ± 5.56 yr. The study includes self assessment questionnaires, psychological tests introduced by the Polar Psychology Project (PPP), a bibliographycal study and photographic measurements. There was no pathological depression in midwinter. Subjective and cumulative fatigue symptoms were more noticiable in the older individuals. The Telic Dominance Scale was significantly correlated with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index. The Sense of Coherence Inventory and the Personal View Survey showed an interrating correlation. By analyzing a daily group photograph, seasonal variations in mood and behavior of individuals have been clarified. Consequently, it is hoped that observation of non-verbal signals such as facial expression, clothing, and postures may lead to the development of a new methodological framework for the long-term plan of psychological investigation of the men under Severe stress.</abstract>"
1998,United States,It is not how much you have but how you use it: Toward a rational use of simulatio to support aviation training,"<title>It is not how much you have but how you use it: Toward a rational use of simulatio to support aviation training</title> <abstract>One of the most remarkable changes in aviation training over the past few decades is the use of simulation. The capabilities now offered by simulation have created unlimited opportunities for aviation training. In fact, aviation training is now more realistic, safe, cost-effective, and flexible than ever before. However, we believe that a number of misconceptions - or invalid assumptions - exist in the simulation community that prevent us from fully exploiting and utilizing recent scientific advances in a number of related fields in order to further enhance aviation training. These assumptions relate to the overreliance on high-fidelity simulation and to the misuse of simulation to enhance learning of complex skills. The purpose of this article is to discuss these assumptions in the hope of initiating a dialogue between behavioral scientists and engineers.</abstract>"
1997,United States,The psychophysiological assessment method for pilot's professional reliability,"<title>The psychophysiological assessment method for pilot's professional reliability</title> <abstract>Background: Previous research has shown that a pilot's professional reliability depends on two relative factors: the pilot's functional state and the demands of task workload. The Psychophysiological Reserve Capacity (PRC) is defined as a pilot's ability to accomplish additive tasks without reducing the performance of the primary task (flight task). Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the PRC was a mirror of the pilot's functional state. The purpose of this study was to probe the psychophysiological method for evaluating a pilot's professional reliability on a simulator. Methods: The PRC Comprehensive Evaluating System (PRCCES) which was used in the experiment included four subsystems: a) quantitative evaluation system for pilot's performance on simulator; b) secondary task display and quantitative estimating system; c) multiphysiological data monitoring and statistical system; and d) comprehensive evaluation system for pilot PRC. Two studies were performed. In study one, 63 healthy and 13 hospitalized pilots participated. Each pilot performed a double 180°circuit flight program with and without secondary task (three digit operation). The operator performance, score of secondary task and cost of physiological effort were measured and compared by PRCCES in the two conditions. Then, each pilot's flight skill in training was subjectively scored by instructor pilot ratings. In study two, 7 healthy pilots volunteered to take part in the experiment on the effects of sleep deprivation on pilot's PRC. Each participant had PRC tested pre- and post-8 h sleep deprivation. Results: The results show that the PRC values of a healthy pilot was positively correlated with abilities of flexibility, operating and correcting deviation, attention distribution, and accuracy of instrument flight in the air (r = 0.27-0.40, p<0.05), and negatively correlated with emotional anxiety in flight (r = -0.40, p < 0.05). The values of PRC in healthy pilots (0.61 ± 0.17) were significantly higher than that of hospitalized pilots (0.43 ± 0.15) (p < 0.05). The PRC value after 8 h sleep loss (0.50 P 0.17) was significantly lower than those before sleep loss (0.70 ± 0.15) (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that a pilot's PRC, which was closely related to flight ability and functional state, could partly represent the pilot's professional reliability. It is worthwhile to further research using a pilot's PRC as a predictor of mental workload in aircraft design.</abstract>"
1996,Canada,The effect of autogenic training and biofeedback on motion sickness tolerance,"<title>The effect of autogenic training and biofeedback on motion sickness tolerance</title> <abstract>Background: Motion sickness is characterized by symptoms of vomiting, drowsiness, fatigue and idiosyncratic changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses such as heart rate (HR) and skin temperature (ST). Previous studies found that symptoms of motion sickness are controllable through self- regulation of ANS responses and the best method to teach such control is autogenic-feedback (biofeedback) training. Recent experiments indicated that biofeedback training is ineffective in reducing symptoms of motion sickness or in increasing tolerance to motion. Hypothesis: If biofeedback facilitates learning of ANS self-regulation then autogenic training with true feedback (TFB) should lead to belief control over ANS responses and better motion tolerance than autogenic training with false feedback (FFB). If there is a relationship between ANS self-regulation and coping with motion stress, a significant correlation should be found between amounts of control over ANS responses and measures of motion tolerance and/or symptoms of motion sickness. Method: There were 3 groups of 6 subjects exposed for 6 weeks to weekly sessions of Coriolis stimulation to induce motion sickness. Between the first and second Coriolis sessions, subjects in the experimental groups received five episodes of autogenic training with either true (group TFB) or false (group FFB) feedback on their HR and ST. The control group (CTL) received no treatment. Results: Subjects learned to control their HR and ST independent of whether they received true or false feedback. Learned control of ST and HR was not related to severity of motion sickness or subject's ability to withstand Coriolis stimulation following treatment. Conclusions: A lack of significant correlation between these variables suggested that subjects were not able to apply their skills of ANS self-regulation in the motion environment, and/or such skills had little value in reducing symptoms of motion sickness or enhancing their ability to withstand rotations.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Crewmember interactions during a Mir space station simulation,"<title>Crewmember interactions during a Mir space station simulation</title> <abstract>Background: Interpersonal problems may negatively affect crews on long- duration space missions. These problems stem from crewmember tension and its displacement to the outside monitoring personnel, and from disruptions in crew cohesion and unclear leadership roles. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that crew tension and dysphoria would transiently increase following stressful events and be greater in the second half of a mission; that cohesion would be less during the second half of a mission; that tension and dysphoria would be displaced to the outside monitoring personnel; and that high levels of leader support and control would produce high levels of cohesion. Methods: We tested these hypotheses during a 135-d Mir space station simulation study in Moscow. At weekly intervals, the three crewmembers completed items from two group climate questionnaires, a mood questionnaire, and a log of stressful events. Results: Contrary to expectations, there was significantly (p < 0.05) more total mood disturbance and tension during the first 9 wks than during the subsequent 10 wks of the simulation. Although levels of cohesion remained the same over lime, cohesion scores dropped at a significantly greater rate during the last third of the seclusion. There was evidence for the displacement of tension and dysphoria to the outside monitoring personnel. There were significant correlations in the predicted direction between leader support and control and crew cohesion, as well as evidence of status leveling in the mission commander. Conclusions: Crewmember tension, cohesion, and leadership are important issues affecting people working in secluded environments, and they need to be studied further in space.</abstract>"

1996,Norway,Psychological reactions during polar expeditions and isolation in hyperbaric chambers,"<title>Psychological reactions during polar expeditions and isolation in hyperbaric chambers</title> <abstract>Background: Psychological data from environments that are considered as analog to space was collected from 68 subjects; 18 in hyperbaric chambers, 16 in polar expeditions, and 34 on Arctic stations. The objective was to identify psychological reactions expected in different phases of spaceflights and examine personality variables associated with superior adaptation. Method: Helmreich Personality Characteristic inventory was administered before the isolation. Adaptation to the environment was assessed through a questionnaire once a week. Results: Crews in hyperbaric chambers indicated a steady increase in coping over the isolation. Polar expeditions members reported high aggressiveness and anxiety in the first quarter and an increase in homesickness over time. A personality characterized by strong expressiveness and instrumentality ('the right stuff') predicted superior adaptation in hyperbaric chambers. Conclusion: The data suggest that isolation in hyperbaric chambers and polar expeditions should be considered as models for different aspects of the space environment.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Prediction of Situational Awareness in F-15 Pilots,"<title>Prediction of Situational Awareness in F-15 Pilots</title> <abstract>Situational awareness (SA) is a skill often deemed essential to pilot performance in both combat and noncombat flying. A study was conducted to determine if SA in U.S. Air Force F-15 pilots could be predicted. The participants were 171 active duty F-15 A/C pilots who completed a test battery representative of various psychological constructs proposed or demonstrated to be valid for the prediction of performance in a wide variety of military and civilian jobs. These predictors encompassed measures of cognitive ability, psychomotor ability, and personality. Supervisor and peer ratings of SA were collected. Supervisors and peers showed substantial agreement on the SA ratings of the pilots. The first unrotated principle component extracted from the supervisor and peer ratings accounted for 92.5% of the variability of ratings. The unrotated first principal component served as the SA criterion. Flying experience measured in number of F-15 hours was the best predictor of SA. After controlling for the effects of F-15 flying hours, the measures of general cognitive ability based on working memory, spatial reasoning, and divided attention were found to be predictive of SA. Psychomotor and personality measures were not predictive. With additional F-15 flying hours it is expected that pilots would improve their ratings of SA.</abstract>"

At the rate of 2 per day, 21 motion challenges were delivered, stopping either at initial symptoms or at moderate nausea, on a cross-over design randomized between subjects (n = 20). The cross-coupled motion challenge had an incrementing profile of rotational velocity from 2- 90° · s-1 in steps of 2° · s-1 every 30 s, with 8 head movements per 30 s, of approximately 45°. The number of head movements tolerated before the onset of nausea increased over the 21 challenges, but the effects of the treatment variation on habituation were not significant. The number of motion challenges, rather than the severity of malaise level achieved, was the more important factor determining habituation.</abstract>"
1995,Norway,Interpersonal relations during simulated space missions,"<title>Interpersonal relations during simulated space missions</title> <abstract>The present article derives from two isolation studies performed for the European Space Agency (ESA) as simulations of space travels, lasting for 4 and 9 weeks. The aim was to study how interpersonal relations were affected by time, and how individual characteristics related to conflicts and tension among crewmembers. A broad bakery of methods was used, including video- recording, peer-ratings and self-reports. In both studies, group-functioning declined in the middle of the isolation and towards the end of the stay. Dominance and task motivation seemed to be important characteristics for compatibility between crewmembers, and negative relations established early in the isolation remained stable over time. These findings have implications for composition, training, and support of crews for extended spaceflights.</abstract>"

Evidence from 23 sources indicates that, despite differences in the analog settings, effective leaders there a common core of personal traits and leadership-style attributes. The general profile that emerges is a person who works hard to achieve mission objectives, is optimistic, holds the respect of the crew, ordinarily uses participative decision-making but takes charge during critical situations, is sensitive to and makes crew members feel valued for their expertise and their personal qualities, and maintains group harmony and cohesion. Results have implications for selecting leaders for future long-duration space missions.</abstract>"

This is a continual challenge as aerospace technology leaps ahead while the human factor remains relatively constant. However, several issues interfere with the smooth interaction between these communities: 1) perceptions that the research and operational communities have towards human subjects and pilots respectively; 2) the legal and ethical considerations involved in exposing individuals to risk; and 3) the ever-present personality dynamics involved in any decision-making process (e.g., returning individuals to a centrifuge panel or flying duty after a medically disqualifying incident). All of these factors influence decisions made in both communities, and how they interact with each other. It is a dynamic process that varies between countries, individual services (e.g., Navy vs Air Force), and even between different geographical locations within the same service.</abstract>"

The MCMI personality scales of those aviators psychiatrically deemed to be free from personality pathology were compared to the scales of those aviators psychiatrically assessed to have maladaptive personalities. The MCMI personality scales reached statistical significance (p < 0.005) for identifying Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2) Cluster C (dependent or avoidant or both) maladaptive personality traits, but did not reach statistical significance for Cluster B (histrionic or narcissistic or both) traits. Military aviators are a highly selected group who have mastered numerous obstacles and who continually prove their adaptability. The prevalence of personality pathology is likely not as great in this population as would be suggested by the MCMI.

An integral part of this selection process was the psychological evaluation, according to the principles laid down in the study report 'Definition of Psychological Testing of Astronaut Candidates.' After national preselection, 59 applicants underwent the psychological evaluation, which consisted of the assessment of operational aptitudes (basic cognitive and psychomotor functions) and personality traits (motivation, social capability, stress resistance). The test program included a diverse number of tests, questionnaires, behavioral ratings, biographical data, and semi-structured interviews. About 50 scores were available for each subject. A comparison of the test scores with the original normative data, culture-fairness of the psychological selection, and discriminant functions analyzing the assessment decisions will be presented and discussed.</abstract>"

We undertook a semi-structured, diagnostic, clinical psychiatric interview with 45 Japanese astronaut applicants for the position of mission specialist-astronaut, and performed 'select-out' psychiatric evaluations according to DSM-III-R psychiatric diagnostic criteria. Two applicants (4.4%) who met Axis I or Axis II disorder criteria in DSM-III-R were evaluated as 'Disqualified.' There were 13 applicants 'Qualified with Reservation'; the majority of their diagnoses were 'hypomania.' Those applicants 'Qualified with Reservation' and 'Disqualified' were not finally selected to be astronauts. This structured interview was not only useful for 'select-out' psychiatric screening of Japanese astronauts, but also made clear the Japanese characteristics of this selection procedure.</abstract>"

Using a peer nomination format, astronauts rated their peers with whom they had either flown or trained. Factor analysis revealed two latent performance dimensions: job competence and group living. The job competence dimension measured the instrumental aspects relating to job knowledge and job performance. The group living dimension measured the interpersonal aspects relating to teamwork and desirability as a colleague on Space Station. Analyses revealed that the personality variables could explain a significant proportion of the variance in the group living performance dimension, but not the job competence performance dimension. The findings are not surprising since astronauts are highly screened on the basis of past attainment, but are not as highly screened on aspects relating to teamwork and interpersonal concerns.</abstract>"
1994,Argentina,HIV-encephalopathy: should we await a catastrophe before screening?,"<title>HIV-encephalopathy: should we await a catastrophe before screening?</title> <abstract>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-encephalopathy (formerly AIDS Dementia Complex, or ADC) is characterized by global impairment of intellectual and cognitive functions, personality and behavioral disturbances, decreased memory, inability to concentrate, and apathy. Its motor dysfunction is manifested by impaired speech, gait, and coordination, and by psychomotor retardation. Several scientific reports indicate that ADC may be the earliest, and, at times, the only evidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and may present a diagnostic challenge, particularly in the aviation context. Several aviation medicine specialists have pointed out the safety questions raised by this condition when it presents in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Since October 1985, U.S. military pilots have been tested for the presence of HIV antibody and grounded if found positive. In May 1991, the Executive Council of the Aerospace Medical Association approved a position statement that supports testing of pilots for infection by HIV, and maintains that ""individuals confirmed to be infected should be found medically disqualified for flying duties."" While bureaucrats delay in resolving HIV mandatory screening, HIV-encephalopathy may be precipitously brought to light, with symptoms involving ocular motor disorders such as dissociated nystagmus, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and impaired saccadic function and smooth pursuit, frequent signs of HIV cerebellar and pontomesencephalic dysfunction.</abstract>"
1994,United States,Psychological predictors of astronaut effectiveness,"<title>Psychological predictors of astronaut effectiveness</title> <abstract>Are the personality characteristics of astronauts related to their professional effectiveness? In order to answer this question, effectiveness and personality data were collected from 65 NASA astronauts. Several findings emerged from these data. Five personality subscales were related to effectiveness in one form or another. They were: high Negative Expressivity and Negative Communion (subordinate and gullible), low Impatience and Irritability, low Openness (to new ideas and experiences), low Negative Instrumentality (egotism) and high Agreeableness. Examining the graphs of these relationships indicated that they were not linear. This examination indicated that high levels on these undesirable personality characteristics (e.g., Impatience/Irritability) were distributed across all levels of effectiveness. Low levels of the undesirable personality characteristics were found only among the most effective astronauts. We concluded that these other-directed personality qualities will assume increasing importance in long-term spaceflight, and consequently, should be the focus of greater attention in future astronaut selection and training.</abstract>"
1993,Germany,The Construction of Personality Questionnaires for Selection of Aviation Personnel,"<title>The Construction of Personality Questionnaires for Selection of Aviation Personnel</title> <abstract>The Personality Research Form (PRF), a questionnaire for voluntary self-description, was administered to a group of applicants (N = 300) for pilot training with a major European airline. Standard psychometric statistics were computed for the PRF subscales. Comparison with information given in the test manual shows that the reliability of all PRF subscales declines in personnel selection. Strong ceiling effects, which were caused by response sets (mainly Social Desirability), were identified as the reason for this phenomenon. The Temperament Structure Scales (TSS), a questionnaire constructed for selection conditions, were presented to the same group. The computed factor-analytic results indicated that the factor structure of the TSS is very similar to that of the PRF. No detrimental downward trend could be revealed for the subscale reliabilities of the TSS. Thus, it seems necessary to construct questionnaires within specific selection conditions to make them robust with respect to the negative psychometric effects of selection. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Eveningness decreased with age (subjects aged 20-30 were more evening-type than subjects over 40). The minimum of the baseline temperature rhythm occurred earlier with age (earlier in subjects aged 30-50 than in subjects aged 20-30). The amplitude of the baseline temperature rhythm declined with age (greater in subjects aged 20-30 than in subjects over 40). Average daily percentage sleep loss during trips increased with age. Among crewmembers flying longhaul flight operations, subjects aged 50-60 averaged 3.5 times more sleep loss per day than subjects aged 20-30. These studies support previous findings that evening types and subjects with later peaking temperature rhythms adapt better to shift work and time zone changes. Age and circadian type may be important considerations for duty schedules and fatigue countermeasures.</abstract>"
1993,United States,Some personality and aptitude characteristics of Air Traffic Control Specialist trainees,"<title>Some personality and aptitude characteristics of Air Traffic Control Specialist trainees</title> <abstract>This study examined the interrelations of personality traits, aptitude test scores, and job performance self-expectations as predictors of success in the FAA Academy screening program of prospective air traffic controllers. Based on the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), men and women Air Traffic Control Specialist (ATCS) trainees exhibited less anxiety and anger than normative groups of college students and Navy recruits. ATCS pass rates for 1,284 entrants were lower within each aptitude test score level for the subjects with anxiety or anger scores above the normative levels. Analyses indicated significant relationships between self-expectations of future job performance and both anxiety and aptitude test scores. Personality factors were found to affect the predictive validity of the primary test used for determining a student's aptitude for learning air traffic control principles and procedures.</abstract>"
1993,United States,Assessments of astronaut effectiveness,"<title>Assessments of astronaut effectiveness</title> <abstract>This study examined the reliability and convergent validity of three methods of peer and supervisory ratings of the effectiveness of individual NASA astronauts and their relationships with flight assignments. These two techniques were found to be reliable and relatively convergent. Seniority and a peer-rated Performance and Competence factor proved to be most closely associated with flight assignments, while supervisor ratings and a peer- rated Group Living and Personality factor were found to be unrelated. Results have implications for the selection and training of astronauts.</abstract>"
1993,United States,Structured Interviews for Pilot Selection: No Incremental Validity,"<title>Structured Interviews for Pilot Selection: No Incremental Validity</title> <abstract>An investigation of a structured interview for the selection of U.S. Air Force pilots was conducted on a sample of 223 pilot trainees. The interview yielded seven ratings of subject attributes, including educational background, self-confidence and leadership, flying motivation, success in training, and success in flying various classes of aircraft. Two other types of predictors were also available-paper-and-pencil aptitude tests and computer-driven cognitive tests of information processing and personality. Using linear models, the validity and incremental validity of the interview as compared to the other classes of tests were evaluated. The interview was found to be valid but not incrementally so. Last, a partial test of a single aspect of the Dipboye (1989) process model of interviews was conducted. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
1992,United States,Predictive Validity of an Automated Personality Inventory for Air Force Pilot Selection,"<title>Predictive Validity of an Automated Personality Inventory for Air Force Pilot Selection</title> <abstract>A study was conducted to assess whether personality measures could contribute predictive utility to current Air Force pilot selection procedures. A personality inventory was given to a sample of 509 pilot candidates before flying training. The inventory was designed to measure five dimensions thought to be associated with flying performance. Of the five characteristics, three measures were related directly to training outcome: hostility, self-confidence, and values flexibility. However, incremental validity analyses did not provide evidence that the inventory could enhance a selection model combining currently used operational test scores with additional measures from the Basic Attributes Tests. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1992,United States,Analyzing Knowledge Deficiencies in Pilot Performance,"<title>Analyzing Knowledge Deficiencies in Pilot Performance</title> <abstract>In the last decade, knowledge deficiencies and attitudinal problems have become recognized as the primary sources of pilot performance breakdown. This article presents an introduction to the five-dimensional professional performance analysis (PPA) system for analyzing and prescribing remedies to minimize pilot error and optimize pilot performance. A detailed presentation of the knowledge dimension of the overall system is presented. The PPA system provides analyses at three levels of detail for each of the five dimensions. The PPA system is a novel combination of proven techniques and methodologies from organizational psychology, flight operations, business leadership, and the management sciences. Each of the 50-plus elements in the knowledge dimension has been validated several times in past generations. The combined process has been used successfully in accident investigations for more than 10 years. The PPA system provides an in-depth analysis tool that has proven value and is easily learned by reasonably experienced, capable leaders. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1992,United States,Success rate analysis of navy SERGRAD flight training,"<title>Success rate analysis of navy SERGRAD flight training</title> <abstract>SERGRADS are selectively retained graduates of Naval Flight Training who become flight instructors during their first tour as Naval Aviators. A perception exists that SERGRADS have more difficulties than newly designated pilots during subsequent training in the Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS). A preliminary inquiry at the F/A-18 FRS revealed that former SERGRADS appear to experience a higher rate of failure on their initial carrier qualification attempt during FRS training. This study examined the SERGRAD experience and compared their performance to trainees from other sources. Although significant differences were found between groups for Fleet Replacement Squadron flight grades and Training Command composite grades, no significant differences were found between the groups for Training Command carrier qualification grades or Fleet Replacement Squadron carrier qualification. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that SERGRADS have more problems or are poorer aviators than F/A-18 students from other sources.</abstract>"
1992,,Psychiatric diagnoses aboard an aircraft carrier,"<title>Psychiatric diagnoses aboard an aircraft carrier</title> <abstract>A descriptive study was conducted for 150 consecutive patients with a psychiatric diagnosis evaluated over 11 months by the medical staff onboard an aircraft carrier. Patients with sole diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence were excluded. Axis II diagnoses, or personality disorders, were more common (N = 120) than Axis I diagnoses (N = 46). The most common Axis I diagnoses were adjustment disorder and major depression. Axis II diagnoses were significantly more likely (OR = 7.33, 95% CI 4.45-12.16, p = 0.000) in sailors less than 23 years of age compared to ship's population. Suicide behavior was demonstrated in 68% (102/150) of the patient population. This study emphasized the requirement for extensive psychiatric training for the clinical aerospace medicine specialists providing operational support to aircraft carrier crews.</abstract>"
1992,United States,"The Canadian Forces airsickness rehabilitation program, 1981-1991","<title>The Canadian Forces airsickness rehabilitation program, 1981-1991</title> <abstract>Airsickness is a significant obstacle in the training of some student pilots. When conventional therapy fails, desensitization therapy may be indicated. Using experience gained by the RAF and USAF, the Canadian Forces (CF) began such a program in 1981. This paper reports program results from 1981-1991. Following subject identification, treatment consists of three phases: biofeedback relaxation therapy, ground-based desensitization training and in-flight desensitization therapy with a pilot-flight surgeon. Employing a definition of cure used by the RAF, success was compared with that of the RAF and USAF programs. A total of 22 student pilots have undergone rehabilitation, 17 of whom have been successfully treated for a success rate of 77%. This is comparable to success rates of other programs. It is reaffirmed that desensitization is a valid clinical tool in treatment of airsickness.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Effects of dexamethasone and high terrestrial altitude on cognitive performance and affect,"<title>Effects of dexamethasone and high terrestrial altitude on cognitive performance and affect</title> <abstract>This study examined the effects of dexamethasone and exposure to high terrestrial altitude on cognitive performance, affect, and personality. Cognitive performance was evaluated by five cognitive tasks, affect was evaluated by the Clyde Mood Scale and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, and personality was examined using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Sixteen healthy young men received either dexamethasone (4 mg every 6 h) (n = 7) or placebo (n = 9) for 34 h prior to and 52 h after ascent to 4,300 m. Subjects treated with dexamethasone correctly performed more computer interaction and addition problems than did placebo-treated subjects. They also were less sleepy, dizzy, depressed, and anxious than placebo-treated subjects at altitude. No adverse effects on cognitive performance, affect, or personality were noted after dexamethasone was discontinued on the third day at altitude. Results indicate that dexamethasone at the present dose positively influences cognitive performance and mood states at altitude, but has no residual effect on personality.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Psychosocial support for cosmonauts,"<title>Psychosocial support for cosmonauts</title> <abstract>Based on a meeting with members of the Psychological Support Group for cosmonauts, along with several referenced documents, the author summarizes the Soviet experience in dealing with psychological and interpersonal factors related to long-duration space missions. Cosmonaut selection and training procedures following the principle of ''neuropsychological resistance'' formulated by F. D. Gorbov. Inflight monitoring uses the macroanalysis of crew speech characteristics as an indicator of psychological state. Psychosocial problems include ''asthenia'' and interpersonal tension. Support efforts focus on enhancing behavioral and autonomic adaptation, planning flexible work/rest schedules, improving the space station environment, arranging relevant free time activities, and helping crews readjust to Earth postflight. Attention is paid to changes in cosmonaut preferences and sensitivities as the mission progresses. The use of support activities is believed to be positively associated with the health and performance of cosmonaut space crews.</abstract>"
1991,Switzerland,Cognitive changes at high altitude in healthy climbers and in climbers developing acute mountain sickness,"<title>Cognitive changes at high altitude in healthy climbers and in climbers developing acute mountain sickness</title> <abstract>We report the cognitive functions of 17 non-acclimatized mountaineers who ascended from low lands to an altitude of 4,559 m in 24 h and were studied there within 6 h. We found that this rapid ascent to high altitude had small, but differential effects upon cognitive performance depending upon the later development of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Subjects who developed AMS within a 24-48-h stay at high altitude were mildly impaired in short term memory, but improved in conceptual tasks, while subjects who remained healthy had a better short term memory performance but no improvement in cognitive flexibility. Possible explanations for these unexpected effects of high altitude are discussed.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Habituation of motion sickness in the cat,"<title>Habituation of motion sickness in the cat</title> <abstract>We subjected 30 female cats to a motion sickness stimulus in three series of tests. A series consisted of five tests given biweekly, weekly, or daily. Each test consisted of 30 min of stimulation followed by 1 min of rest, and series were separated by a period of not less than 14 d. Retching was the dependent variable. No habituation (reduction in the incidence of retching) was found with biweekly testing but pronounced habituation was observed with weekly and daily testing. The 30 cats were divided evenly into high and low susceptibility groups based on the results of the biweekly tests. The rate of habituation was the same for the two susceptibility groups in both the weekly and daily series.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Relationships of anxiety scores to screening and training status of air traffic controllers,"<title>Relationships of anxiety scores to screening and training status of air traffic controllers</title> <abstract>The present study assessed the relationship between anxiety, as measured by the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), and success of post-strike air traffic control specialist (ATCS) trainees at the FAA Academy and during field training. The STPI was administered to students who entered the FAA Academy between June 1984 and September 1985. Academy test scores were obtained for 1,790 students in the en route option. Criterion data included the field training status of the Academy graduates as of July 1988. Statistical analyses determined the relationships between ATCS student scores on the STPI measures and a) normative data and b) Academy screening and field training results. ATCS students reported significantly lower state (current level) and trait (proneness) levels of anxiety than did either college students or military recruits. Trainees who had relatively high scores (for ATCSs) on a combined index of the trait and state measures of anxiety exhibited significantly higher a) percentages of Academy failures/withdrawals, b) percentages of option switchers in the field, and c) overall field attrition, than did trainees with low scores. Results support the operation of some personality-related self-selection among ATCS applicants regarding anxiety and the importance of this low anxiety characteristic for ATCS job success.</abstract>"
1991,Germany,The Impact of Personality and Task Characteristics on Stress and Strain During Helicopter Flight,"<title>The Impact of Personality and Task Characteristics on Stress and Strain During Helicopter Flight</title> <abstract>A longitudinal research project on stress and strain of helicopter pilots engaged in low-altitude night flight with night vision goggles (NVG) was carried out over 3 years. An overview is given regarding the design and theoretical background of the project Psychological, physiological, and observational data were collected before, during, and after flight. In our theoretical model, stress and strain in flight result from concrete actions by specific pilots in specific objectively definable situations. Traits, such as anxiety, riskiness, and aggressiveness, are regarded as manifestations of behavior regulation styles, which appear during flight. These traits and behavior regulation patterns are determined by cognitive processes, especially the pilots perception of himself and the situation. By identifying those characteristics of the person and the environment that (in an interaction) lead to critical flight situations and stress, it is possible to deduce weak points and give recommendations in the domain of flight security. As examples for concrete interactions between personality and situational variables, the observed stress of helicopter crews, which depends on the personality characteristics of riskiness and test anxiety (worry cognitions), and situation-characteristic difficulty are introduced. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

1991,South Africa,The measurement of psychophysiological reactions of pilots to a stressor in a flight simulator,"<title>The measurement of psychophysiological reactions of pilots to a stressor in a flight simulator</title> <abstract>Seventeen Boeing 737 pilots were exposed to an acute stressor in a flight simulator: a birdstrike between V<inf>1</inf> (velocity of aircraft on take-off run at which crew is committed to take-off regardless of any incidents occurring) and V(R) (velocity of aircraft at take-off). Certain physiological variables together with state anxiety scores were measured at different stages of the simulated flight. Levels of plasma cortisol, norepinephrine, total protein, total lipid, lactate, and the haematocrit changed significantly across the test conditions. Plasma epinephrine, osmolality and glucose levels did not change significantly across the test conditions. Captains and copilots differed significantly in the profiles obtained for the state anxiety scores. The variables measured in this study demonstrated different profiles in response to the stressor. Conceptual and methodological problems need to be solved before an integrated psychophysiological approach to the reactions of pilots to stressors can be developed.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Community psychological effects following a non-fatal aircraft accident,"<title>Community psychological effects following a non-fatal aircraft accident</title> <abstract>Following a non-fatal military aircraft accident, two of the authors interviewed the crewmen involved in the accident, their spouses, fellow squadron members and their spouses, and individuals from the fire crew and control tower on duty during the accident. A total of 37 respondents completed questionnaires which reported the presence of intrusive, avoidant, depressive/anxious, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Spouses reported more symptoms after the accident than their flying husbands. Intrusive symptoms were most common. Symptoms were correlated with various perceptions and experiences occurring prior to and following the accident. Several kinds of symptoms and experiences were significantly correlated with a perception of morale decline. This study suggests that even non-fatal aircraft accidents may have important psychological effects on those involved and on the surrounding community. Implications of these findings and recommendations for helping communities process traumatic events are discussed.</abstract>"
1990,United States,Trends and individual differences in response to short-haul flight operations,"<title>Trends and individual differences in response to short-haul flight operations</title> <abstract>A survey of airline pilots was undertaken to determine normative patterns and individual differences in mood and sleep during short-haul flight operations. The results revealed that over the course of a typical 2-d trip, pilots experience a decline in positive mood, or activity, and an increase in negative mood, or tension. On layovers, pilots report experiencing sleep of shorter duration and poorer quality than at home. These patterns are very similar to those reported by Gander and Graeber (7) and by Gander et al. (8) using high-fidelity sleep and activity monitoring equipment. Examination of the impact of two personality dimensions extracted from the Jenkins Activity Survey measure of the Type A personality, Achievement Striving and Impatience/ Irritability, suggested that Impatience/Irritability may serve as a marker of individuals most likely to experience health-related problems on trips. Achievement Striving may serve as a predictor of performance in crew settings.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Influence of attitude and expectation on moods and symptoms during cold weather military training,"<title>Influence of attitude and expectation on moods and symptoms during cold weather military training</title> <abstract>The present study examined the influence of the following: 1) air temperature, 2) day into training, 3) self rating of life stress, 4) rating of relative warmth in cold weather, and 5) expectation for liking cold weather training, on 59 soldiers' self-reports of illness and mood during 3 days of training in the cold (-18° to 0°C range). Mood was assessed on six domains of the Profile of Mood States rating scale, and symptoms of illness were assessed on 5 domains of the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses showed that: 1) the most soliders expected to dislike the cold weather training, the more tense, depressed, angry, fatigued, and physically uncomfortable they were during training; 2) the more stress they perceived in their everyday lives, the more fatigued, confused, and physically uncomfortable they were during training; 3) as days into training increased the more fatigued and physically uncomfortable they became; and 4) due to appropriate clothing and training, ambient temperature was found to have no significant influence on the soldiers' moods and symptoms.</abstract>"

In 30 subjects the mean threshold for the detection of Z axis stimuli was 1.5 deg·s-1. X and Y axis thresholds of 20 subjects had mean values of 2.04 and 2.07 deg*5-1, respectively, and were significantly higher than Z axis thresholds. The mean Z axis threshold of 6 subjects, who viewed a visual target fixed to the turntable, was reduced by 8.6 dB over that obtained in darkness. Z axis thresholds were found to increase at 5.9 dB/decade as a function of stimulus duration over the range 0.9 to 20 s. The possible implication of this finding in relation to the dynamics of the sensory system mediating the perception of whole-body angular movement is discussed.</abstract>"

Members of an expedition to Mount Everest completed a series of neuropsychological tests before and after the expedition. Exposure to altitudes above 7,200 m was limited to a maximum of four consecutive nights, separated by rest periods at lower altitudes. No significant decline in performance was observed on any test. The subjects also completed a short series of tests at different altitudes during the expedition. No significant deterioration was observed at altitudes up to 7,500 m. There do not appear to be lasting harmful effects on brain function under these conditions.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Behavioral and physiological responses of stayers and quitters in underwater isolation,"<title>Behavioral and physiological responses of stayers and quitters in underwater isolation</title> <abstract>Although the tolerance of subjects (Ss) to sensory isolation has been studied over the past 35 years or so, most attention has been paid to such variables as personality characteristics and less attention to physiological measures related to endurance. Additionally, the more profound isolation environment of water immersion has been much less studied than the quiet room environment. The present study reports, for the first time, physiological data from Ss who underwent short- and long-term water immersion isolation, investigates the accuracy of time estimation, and includes psychological data on these two groups. In this study, Ss who terminated isolation in less than 3 h overestimated elapsed time, tend to be introverted and anxious and reported substantial hallucinatory activity. Those Ss who terminated after more than 3 h, and closer to 6 h, underestimated elapsed time, tend to be extroverted, and maintained a better orientation to the isolation environment. Physiological indices of the short-termers showed no differences in EKG rate, a more rapid EEG pattern, and a different breathing pattern than did the long-termers. Most of these group differences are consistent with the notion that the short-term Ss were more aroused and felt more anxiety in the isolation environment than did the long term Ss.</abstract>"

The task required a correct choice of which of two simultaneously presented matrices matched a previously presented sample matrix. The effects of task performance in cold and ambient temperatures was examined on three repeated occasions, one pair of conditions per week. Response accuracy was consistently impaired in each cold session. In addition, choice response latencies lengthened and sample response latencies decreased in all cold exposures. The data show that even moderate cold exposure that does not procude core hypothermia can impair performance of a complex cognitive task and that the magnitude of performance change is not attenuated by a brief series of cold exposures.</abstract>"
1989,United States,Adjustment of sleep and the circadian temperature rhythm after flights across nine time zones,"<title>Adjustment of sleep and the circadian temperature rhythm after flights across nine time zones</title> <abstract>The adjustment of sleep-wake patterns and the circadian temperature rhythm was monitored in nine Royal Norwegian Airforce volunteers operating P-3 aircraft during a westward training deployment across nine time zones. Subjects recorded all sleep and nap times, rated nightly sleep quality, and completed personality inventories. Rectal temperature, heart rate, and wrist activity were continuously monitored. Adjustment was slower after the return eastward flight than after the outbound westward flight. The easward flight produced slower readjustment of sleep timing to local time and greater interindividual variability in the patterns of adjustment of sleep and temperature. One subject apparently exhibited resynchronization by partition, with the temperature rhythm undergoing the reciprocal 15-h delay. In contrast, average heart rates during sleep were significantly elevated only after westward flight. Interindividual differences in adjustment of the temperature rhythm were correlated with some of the personality measures. Larger phase delays in the overall temperature waveform (as measured on the 5th day after westward flight) were exhibited by extraverts, and less consistently by evening types.</abstract>"

1989,Australia,Low temperature worsens mammalian oxygen toxicity,"<title>Low temperature worsens mammalian oxygen toxicity</title> <abstract>Oxygen toxicity was assessed in mice exposed to 5 ATA of oxygen. Central nervous system toxicity was measured as the latent period before convulsions, and lung damage estimated by wet and dry weight measurements. Our results confirmed previous findings that hyperbaric oxygen induces hypothermia in animals, and this effect is profound in mice exposed to 5 ATA of oxygen at ambient temperatures of 15°C and 5°C. However, even marked hypothermia had very little effect on the latent times to convulsions in mice. Unexpectedly, the combination of hypothermia and hyperbaric oxygen produced much more sever lung damage than either treatment alone, with a 2.7-fold increase in weight in the 5°C group (average rectal temperature of 16.1°C). These results indicate that hyperoxic-induced hypothermia cannot be considered a protective mechanism against oxygen toxicity and indeed hypothermia can markedly potentiate hyperbaric oxygen toxicity.</abstract>"

1988,United States,Mood states at 1600 and 4300 meters terrestrial altitude,"<title>Mood states at 1600 and 4300 meters terrestrial altitude</title> <abstract>Personal anecdotes suggest that ascent to high altitude can cause mood changes such as depression, apathy, and drowsiness. Observed behaviors at high altitude indicate that people can become more euphoric, irritable, or argumentative. Since there are few systematic and quantitative studies assesssing the effects of altitude on mood, this study compared moods measured at two different altitudes and times of day (morning-evening) using a standardized scale. Self-rated moods were determined twice daily in 19 males and 16 females with the Clyde Mood Scale. Baseline values were determined at 200 m; moods were then assessed at 4300 m with one group and at 1600 m with a second group. Friendliness, clear thinking, dizziness, sleepiness, and unhappiness were affected at 4300 m but only sleepiness changed at 1600 m. At 4300 m, the altered moods differed from baseline on the day of arrival (1-4 hours), differed even more after one day (18-28 hours), and returned to baseline by day 2 (42-52 hours). Morning and evening values were similar at each altitude. Therefore, changes in mood states at altitude have a distinct and measurable time course.</abstract>"
1987,United Kingdom,The nature of sensorimotor adaptation to altered G-levels: evidence from mass discrimination.,"<title>The nature of sensorimotor adaptation to altered G-levels: evidence from mass discrimination.</title> <abstract>Mass discrimination is impaired under zero G compared to 1 G. This is partly due to loss of weight information (a reduction in z-axis pressure stimulation), and probably also to incomplete adaptation to the reduced G-level. Maladaptation to an increased G-level postflight causes objects to feel too heavy and weight discrimination to be impaired. Video tapes of hand movements while shaking test objects were made before, during, and after the D-1 Spacelab mission. Movements were faster inflight than preflight, slowed down postflight and returned to baseline by about the third day. Corresponding changes in movement amplitude also occurred. Errors of weight or mass perception during the maladaptation phase may be due to both inadequate monitoring of command signals and to inappropriate scaling of afferent signals. High-acceleration shaking was found to improve mass discrimination but impair weight discrimination.</abstract>"

Sixteen subjects were selected on the basis of their response to a motion sickness history questionnaire and assigned to one of four groups on the basis of their ability to tolerate visually-induced motion (VM). One group received 10 sessions of confidence building and desensitization training (BT); a second group received 10 sessions of EMG and temperature biofeedback (FB); a third group received 10 sessions of BT and 10 sessions of FB (BTFB); and a fourth group received no treatment (C). The results indicated that the BT and BTFB groups exhibited significant increases in tolerance to VM when pretreatment measures were compared to posttreatment measures, while no significant differences in pre-post measures were observed in the FB or C groups. A similar pattern emerged from the symptomatology data.</abstract>"
1987,United States,Transfer of perceptual-motor training and the space adaptation syndrome.,"<title>Transfer of perceptual-motor training and the space adaptation syndrome.</title> <abstract>Perceptual cue conflict may be the basis for the symptoms which are experienced by space travelers in microgravity conditions. Recovery has been suggested to take place after perceptual modification or reinterpretation. To elucidate this process, 10 subjects who repeatedly experienced a visual/vestibular conflict (Purkinje) over trials and days, were then tested in a similar but not identical perceptual situation (pseudo-Coriolis) to determine whether any savings in perceptual adaptation had occurred as compared to an unpracticed control group (N = 10). The practiced subjects experienced lessening dizziness and ataxia within and over sessions. Their response to the new perceptual situation was markedly less than the control group (p less than 0.001). Assessment of ""adaptability,"" in addition to the provocative vestibular tests now in use, may improve prediction of susceptibility to the space adaptation syndrome. An adaptability trait may exist in humans which, properly measured, could be used to predict who would adapt more readily to visual/vestibular conflict and perhaps to environmental stressors in general.</abstract>"
1987,Norway,Differential neuropsychological effects of diving to 350 meters,"<title>Differential neuropsychological effects of diving to 350 meters</title> <abstract>Six divers were compressed on heliox to 350 m. Repeated neuropsychological and neurological tests were conducted during the dive. Averaged increased tremor during the compression was found. Two divers had major EEG changes, while two divers had a completely normal EEG. Memory was most impaired among the cognitive variables. At 350 m there was some normalization in the EEG, and the tremor levels returned to normal. Memory impairment, however, was sustained. Three months later nine divers performed an open sea dive to 300 m. Whereas minor fatigue effects were found for the experimental dive, examinations after the open sea dive indicated more specific cerebral aftereffects. An increased tremor, reduced hand grip strength and foot tapping speed, lowered autonomic reactivity, and memory problems were found. Some divers had unequivocal asymmetrical plantar responses and unilateral weak abdominal reflexes, accompanied by EEG changes with corresponding laterality. In three of the divers these signs were not present 1 month later.</abstract>"
1987,Russian Federation,Slow oscillations of psychophysiological parameters in human operators during monotony,"<title>Slow oscillations of psychophysiological parameters in human operators during monotony</title> <abstract>Objective estimation of the human operator's functional state is an urgent problem in applied psychophysiology. It helps to forecast the reliability and efficiency of the operator's activity. Slow (minute) changes in the functional state of 22 subjects were recorded and analysed in experiments simulating the long-term operator's activity. Spatial synchronization of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the heart-rate (HR) served as parameters. It was shown that the time of detection and identification of visual signals (geometrical figures) amid visual 'noise' in a long-term observation naturally depends on the changes in a subject's state. These changes were estimated by slow (2-3 min) components of the changes in spatial synchronization of EEG and HR throughout 3 h of the experiment. These objective parameters of the human operator's state may be used to predict efficiency. The connection between minute oscillations of electrophysiological parameters and time of reaction is absent during the first 30 min of the experiment, then appears and increases throughout further stages, becoming clearly marked in its second half.</abstract>"

In 17 cases, the CRBBB was detected in the first electrocardiogram (ECG). In 24 cases, the CRBBB appeared after normal ECGs; the CRBBB development did not change the electrical axis in 75%, and in 50% of them an incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB) appeared first, suggesting a progressive compromise of the right bundle branch. One case developed arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease, another one mitral valve prolapse, and there were two cases of non-cardiovascular diseases. The CRBBB etiology in asymptomatic individuals is uncertain. The prognosis depends on the underlying disease. Once those etiologies which by themselves imply a future risk are ruled out, they may be waivered for flying activities with periodical ECG controls.</abstract>"
1985,Australia,Back to basics: suggested solutions to some flight instruction problems,"<title>Back to basics: suggested solutions to some flight instruction problems</title> <abstract>Since 1976 a series of surveys of flight instructors and students in general and commercial aviation, and the Royal Australian Air Force, has indicated several common problems in flight instruction. These problems have provided a focus for instructor education programs described in this paper. Professional preparation of instructions in areas such as educational psychology (learning and memory, motivation, and skill acquisition) met with the approval of the participants, but no detectable change in instructional methods resulted. It is concluded that a commitment to the professionalization of flight instruction must come from within the occupational group.</abstract>"
1985,United Kingdom,The stress of work: An overview,"<title>The stress of work: An overview</title> <abstract>This paper looks at a number of potential occupational stressors found to predict job dissatisfaction and ill health (both mental and physical) in a variety of different occupational settings. Factors intrinsic to the nature of the job, role ambiguity and conflict, poor relationships at work, lack of career development, inadequate organisation structure/climate, and problems associated with the interface between work and homelife are the focal points of attention. Many of these sources of occupational stress are prevalent in the field of aviation, and may be exacerbated by the move toward deregulation and increasing commercial competition within the industry.</abstract>"

1984,United States,Motion sickness susceptibility in student navigators,"<title>Motion sickness susceptibility in student navigators</title> <abstract>Identification of individuals highly susceptible to motion sickness could be of significant benefit in managing flying personnel in training. Several studies in the past four decades with this end have been primarily aimed at pilot trainees. The following study is a prospective evaluation of airsickness in Air Force navigation students. Motion Sickness Questionnaires and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventories were given to the students at the beginning of navigator training. Airsickness was assessed by means of questionnaires and evaluation by a flight surgeon. Motion sickness among navigation trainees was found to be quite common. However, prediction of susceptible individuals by methods used was not reliable. Further investigation of airsickness susceptibility in navigation students by means of physiologic technique is suggested.</abstract>"

Symptoms should be matched against the textbook description of psychiatric disease: if the match is good, a diagnosis of psychiatric ill health is made. Subtle questioning of patients concerning psychiatric symptoms such as smoking and alcohol is required, and facial expression and demeanor comprise important diagnostic factors. The functional neuroses and psychoses and the organic psychiatric diseases, together with personality and psychomatic disorders and drug dependence, are reviewed.</abstract>"
1983,United States,"Locus of control, self-serving biases, and attitudes towards safety in general aviation pilots","<title>Locus of control, self-serving biases, and attitudes towards safety in general aviation pilots</title> <abstract>Of the three related survey studies that were conducted, two are summarized and one, which characterizes all three, is reported in detail. The studies attempted to determine how aviators compared with the general population on the personality dimension - locus of control (internal vs. external) and how this was related to aviators' attenance at FAA Safety Clinics. In addition, aviators were surveyed regarding their attituds towards safety, their flying skill, and the likelihood that they would have an accident during the remainder of their careers. Results showed aviators to be significantly more internal in locus of control than the general U.S. population and to have strong self-serving biases regarding their skill and safety levels. Pilots who attended FAA Safety Clinics tended to have a more internal locus of control than those who did not.</abstract>"
1983,,The Wright brothers: a personality profile.,"<title>The Wright brothers: a personality profile.</title> <abstract>Wilbur and Orville Wright were able, as a team, to develop the first heavier than air machine capable of sustained, controlled, powered flight while piloted by a man. This was due, very possibly, to the presence of a left hemispheric dominant personality in Wilbur Wright and a right hemispheric dominant personality in Orville Wright. They were thus able to complement each other's skills and creativity in such a way as to make this feat possible. This paper will examine this hypothesis by examining the features of cerebral dominance as now understood, and applying them to the personality profiles of these two brothers.</abstract>"
1983,United States,Neuropsychological functioning after prolonged high altitude exposure in mountaineering,"<title>Neuropsychological functioning after prolonged high altitude exposure in mountaineering</title> <abstract>This prospective study examined the possibility of long lasting CNS sequelae of high altitude exposure in mountaineering. An extensive battery of neuropsychological and personality tests was given to 22 subjects before and after Himalayan climbs above 5334m (17,500 ft). All subjects were at altitude for long periods without supplemental oxygen, but did not suffer other physical insults such as serious injury or food or water deprivation. Although several climbers experienced acute effects of mountain sickness while at altitude, their post-climb evaluations revealed no evidence of lasting cerebral dysfunction or psychological deficit. A few climbers' subjective ratings of mental functioning were worse after their expeditions, but these self-assessments were unsupported by their performances on the objective testing. It was concluded that in healthy people who do not suffer other physical insults as well, acute CNS effects of low oxygen tensions during high altitude climbs are reversible.</abstract>"

All subjects were given six Coriolis Sickness Susceptibility Index (CSSI) tests separated by 5-d intervals. Treatment Group I subjects were taught to control their own autonomic responses before the third, fourth, and fifth CSSI tests (6 h total training). Group II subjects were given 'sham' training in an alternative cognitive task under conditions otherwise identical to those of Group I. Group III subjects received no treatment. Results showed the Group I subjects could withstand the stress of Coriolis acceleration significantly longer after training. Neither of the other two groups changed significantly.</abstract>"
1982,United States,Subjective response to negative air ion exposure,"<title>Subjective response to negative air ion exposure</title> <abstract>This study investigated specific subjective or psychological effects of relatively long exposure to negative ions generated by a conventional air purification device. Subjects - 24 males matched for age, education, physical condition, and smoking habits - were divided into a control (N=12) and an ion exposure group (N=12). The groups were subjected to 6 h normal and negatively charged atmospheres, respectively. The tests used were the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS) and a self-report mood index. The analysis of TMAS change scores clearly showed no effect of negative ion exposure on anxiety. Analysis of mood index data showed significant changes in the subjective perception of both physiological state (relaxation increased) and psychological state (irritability, depression, and tenseness decreased while calmness and stimulation increased).</abstract>"
1982,United States,Relationship of personality factors and some social habits to cardiovascular risk in submariners,"<title>Relationship of personality factors and some social habits to cardiovascular risk in submariners</title> <abstract>Correlation and contingency analytical techniques were used to investigate the relationship between subtest scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in 1000 submariners. Groups of pesonality traits, both enhancing and protecting against risk of heart disease, were identified in these subjects. Personality trait patterns tending to be least associated with cardiovascular risk are tentatively identified by the three MMPI scales: psychasthenia, schizophrenia, and social introversion. On the other hand, the scales most strongly related to CHD risk in the submariner sample were denial of symptoms as measured by the K-scale, hypochondriasis, and hysteria. While the inherent inaccuracy in the prediction of CHD risk in young healthy individuals limits generalization from these findings, the potential utility of the MMPI to assist in risk detection is indicated. Comparisons of cigarette smoking, coffee drinking, and alcohol consumption with personality characteristics identified by the MMPI yielded trait clusters associated with each addictive habit. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption tended to correlate with traits positively associated with CHD risk. The correlations between those addictive habits and MMPI subtest scores were most significant for the F-scale, which measures inordinate tendencies to exaggerated emotional symptoms, and for the psychopathic deviate and hypomania scales. Significant negative correlations were found between the amount of coffee consumed and those personality traits negatively associated with CHD risk. These negative relationships were most significant for the MMPI scales schizophrenia and psychasthenia. Though the relationships were not necessarily construed to be causal, the contrasting modes through which these drug-associated habits appeared to relate to cardiovascular risk lend some support to the assumption that individuals with various specific sets of personality characteristics tend to incorporate these addictive behaviors into their behavior repertoire in very different ways.</abstract>"

This was accompanied by a sharp increase in paranoia and obsessive-compulsiveness and smaller increases in depression and hostility.</abstract>"
1980,United States,Values clarification and the post-myocardial infarction patient,"<title>Values clarification and the post-myocardial infarction patient</title> <abstract>Marked changes in an individual's attitudes and actions are frequently due to severe or prolonged conditions of stress. A stress encountered by the myocardial infarction patient is the anxiety or depression induced by the forced reduction of activities. Values clarification may be utilized to assist the patient to sort out those activities that are truly important, thus decreasing tension and anxiety. Values, developed and subsequently modified by a person's on-going experiences, give direction to life. Values clarification assists in developing an awareness of those entities a person considers important. It rests on a specific method of responding to what an individual says or does. The clarifying response is non-judgmental and encourages the individual to examine and to think about his life and ideas. The responsibility is placed on the individual to make a decision as to what he wants. Understanding a patient's values provides the nursing staff with a rational basis for his care and support.</abstract>"

1980,United Kingdom,The effect of propranolol on human psychomotor performance,"<title>The effect of propranolol on human psychomotor performance</title> <abstract>Despite their widespread usage the effect of beta blockers on human performance has been only sparsely studied and results of investigations are discrepant. This study examines the effect of one of the most commonly prescribed beta adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol, on psychomotor function. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the test method and to provide some basis for comparison, the effect of small doses of sodium amylobarbitone on psychomotor performance is also measured. Results indicate that propranolol in a single dose of 40 mg produces a small but significant decrement of performance, an effect comparable to that of 25 mg of sodium amylobarbitone. Habituation to chronic administration of propranolol at a daily dose level of 120 mg is also apparent. The clinical significance of these effects, particularly in aviation medicine, is discussed.</abstract>"
1980,United States,Minimizing the psychological effects of a wartime disaster on an individual,"<title>Minimizing the psychological effects of a wartime disaster on an individual</title> <abstract>In this paper, the psychological reactions of individuals and groups to a wartime disaster, such as nuclear explosion, are presented. The psychological literature on disasters is discussed. The presentation attempts to emphasize viewing the victims of a disaster as individuals responding in a normal way to an overwhelming experience, rather than labeling them as psychiatric patients. The various phases of a disaster are discussed with particular emphases on the preventive measures and leadership roles which may be taken by the physician. The development and treatment of situational psychoses, as well as neurotic reactions, are examined and the dynamics especially of long-lasting neurotic problems explored. The paper concludes by making specific recommendations regarding the establishment of disaster plans and training programs at each military facility. It is suggested that the use of such plans may help minimize the psychological effects of a wartime disaster on the individual.</abstract>"

Rhesus monkeys were trained to track in order to avoid shock (Method #1) to obtain food (Method #2). One animal received training under both procedures. Both techniques were effective; however, the method utilizing shock produced faster learning and more efficient performance. The possible reasons for these differences are discussed along with generality of the results. These methods should have implications for tracking research in which animal models are required.</abstract>"

They were tested and examined clinically each morning. Groups 1 and 2 had no organized sleep, whereas groups 3 and 4 got 3 and 6 h, respectively, in the middle of each course. Substantial impairment was observed in all tests, as well as clinical symptoms toward the end of the courses for groups 1 and 2. In the vigilance test, the reaction time task, the code test, and the profile of mood-state, significant impairment was observed even after 24 h. Complaints of symptoms came first. Disturbance of senses and behaviour appeared later. Group 4 had significantly better results than groups 1 and 2 in clinical symptoms and all tests, except the positive score in mood-state. Group 3 occupied an intermediate position. Corresponding results were obtained in the two separate courses. In the morning following the course, recovery after 4 h of sleep was less extensive for course II than course I participants.</abstract>"

Susceptibility to motion sickness was determined by scores on a motion sickness questionnaire (MSQ); only individuals with extreme scores were considered for inclusion in the experimental groups. The following tests were administered: Floor Ataxia Test Battery, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, Cornell Medical Index, Cornell Word Form, Eysenck Personality Inventory, Rotter Internal External Locus of Control Scale, and the 16 Personality Factors test. Each subject was tested on at least three, but not more than six, of the eight tests. Significant sex differences were obtained on the ataxia battery and the Cornell Medical Index. Susceptible subjects did not differ significantly from nonsusceptibles on the ataxia battery but did differ significantly on all personality tests except the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (administered only to women) and the Rotter Scale. The generally consistent and significant patterns of results from the psychological tests probably reflect the selection factors used in defining the subject groups; certain personality characteristics are associated with a high degree of susceptibility to motion sickness.</abstract>"

Mood states also were determined on all subjects at 4300 m (Pikes Peak, Co) and on 18 of these subjects at 1600 m (staging site). Mood state changes were not observed at 1600 m, but four of the six mood factors were sensitive to the 4300 m altitude. At 4300 m, all subjects, treatment and control, rated themselves as less friendly and clear thinking and more sleepy and dizzy. At 4300 m, the treatment strategy resulted in an improved mood on the friendly, sleepy, and dizzy factors. Altitude-induced changes in clear thinking were not altered by the treatment strategy.</abstract>"
1977,,Psychological considerations with patients on respirators,"<title>Psychological considerations with patients on respirators</title> <abstract>Illness is a subjective experience for patients and, as such, responses to illness are as varied as the patients' personalities. Special psychological considerations are necessary when delivering care to patients on respirators since they, more than others, are dependent upon people and machines for each breath of life. Providing active psychological support systems requires an awareness of the Intensive Care Unit environment, patients responses to illness and the environment, and implementation of appropriate psychological intervention. This paper reviews and discusses: the ambivalent feelings produced by the ICU environment, emotional responses of patients, complications that result from psychological responses to respirators and their management, the psychological aspects of weaning patients from respirators, the application of specific direct and indirect psychological interventions, and implications of these psychological considerations for patients being transported on respirators via aeromedical evacuation systems.</abstract>"

When administered separately, both atropine and mevinphos produced a dose related decrement in responding. The combined exposure to these drugs produced a performance decrement greater than that caused by exposure to each component drug alone. These findings suggest that prophylactic use of atropine may increase the detrimental behavioral effects of organophosphate exposure and that the atropine exposure alone may produce serious behavioral deficits.</abstract>"

1976,United States,Cross validation study of the personality aspects of involvement in pilot error accidents,<title>Cross validation study of the personality aspects of involvement in pilot error accidents</title> <abstract>Pilot error accidents have dominated accident statistics consistently from the 1940s to the present. In an earlier study the authors found that three factors from Cattell's Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF) exhibited significant differences (p<0.05) between pilot error accident groups; these were used to correctly classify 86% of the aviators tested as to their previous pilot error accident involvement. There were 66 aviators given the 16 PF in the present study in an attempt to cross validate the findings reported in the original study. The results indicate that the personality factors did not significantly discriminate between the pilot error accident groups. The primary personality differences between the present sample and the original sample were due to variations in the pilot error accident free groups. The findings indicate that individual differences in personality characteristics of the aviators prevent consistent identification of traits associated with pilot error groups.</abstract>

The study reveals that crew selection plus ongoing support by psychiatric staff permits continued function in an exotic milieu. Prediction of psychophysiologic symptoms was possible using paper and pencil tests. Trait anxiety was altered by the isolation in a psychologically healthy direction. Sudden time shifts of 8 h led to an immediate significant increase in depression, aggression, and hostility, and are accompanied by marked increases in physical symptoms. During the first free running phase of the experiment, significant shifts were found on four psychological measures. The shifts indicate that subjects became less trusting, more orderly, more routinized, less energetic and more depressed. A reducer augmenter scale predicted the number of psychophysiologic complaints reported by individual subjects while isolated. A group interaction effect on circadian rhythms was isolated but needs furhter examination.</abstract>"

Use of interrater agreement as a reliability index and 2 cutoff points for the partition of the sample resulted in the elimination of about 1/3 of the initial sample and the formation of 2 subsamples: the 'sick' (N = 45) and 'not sick' (N = 73) sailors. By using differentially weighted scores for various intensities of seasickness, it was demonstrated that 2 normally confounded aspects of seasickness can be assessed independently: physical symptoms, which constitute the apparent severity of the sickness (A.S.S.), and level of actual performance (A.P.), which reflects the individual's attempts to cope with the sickness. A.S.S. and A.P. showed differential relationships with variables such as a personality disposition of active coping, military rank, and sociometric status.</abstract>"

This study was conducted to determine the human factors causation of aircraft accidents. A review of 545 aircraft accidents revealed that over 50% were caused by human error. These errors involved supervision, limited experience, and errors in judgment. Since materiel factors in accidents have remained relatively constant, more emphasis must be placed on training and selection of our aircrews and supervisors.</abstract>"
1975,United States,Psychological characteristics of deep submergence vehicle personnel,"<title>Psychological characteristics of deep submergence vehicle personnel</title> <abstract>The personality and developmental characteristics of US Navy Deep Submergence Vehicle (DSV) personnel, including operators and crews, were documented and compared to the characteristics of US Navy divers. The results show that DSV operators (DSV Oprs) had a significantly less asocial developmental pattern than divers, while developmental experiences of DSV crews (DSV Crs) were similar to those of divers. Personality measures (EPPS) indicate that both DSV Oprs and DSV Crs are presently more sociable as adults than divers and would probably be more effective in situations involving small group interaction. The modifications which have occurred in the behavior of DSV Crs may be related to experience in the highly interpersonal DSV situation. The findings also show that DSV Oprs prefer to take fewer risks than divers, while the DSV Crs are more like divers in risk taking behavior. The implications of this research to DSV mission effectiveness are discussed. These findings indicate that divers would probably not be effective DSV Oprs, and that measures of sociability and interpersonal responsiveness may be especially useful in recruiting and managing personnel in DSV operations. The social characteristics and interpersonal behavior patterns described by these results may be among the most important factors in DSV mission effectiveness. Replication of these results on other DSV personnel, such as civilian DSV Oprs, would strengthen these conclusions.</abstract>"

Four subgroups in each were exposed to 1, 7.1, 10.2, or 13.3 ATA for 30 min once a week for 6 weeks with a seventh exposure after a 4 week hiatus. At 10.2 and 13.3 ATA, DRL 20 s response rate increased and VR 50 decreased. At 13.3 ATA, time spent responding was markedly reduced for the VR 50 animals and less so for the DRL 20 s animals. Response rate of the DRL 20 s group varied as a function of weekly exposures to pressure, but not systematically so. There was an increase in VR 50 time spent responding on the third dive which continued through the sixth and was lost on the seventh. Findings were discussed in terms of the utility of a behavioral preparation for a pharmacological analysis of nitrogen narcosis.</abstract>"
1975,United States,Personality aspects of involvement in pilot error accidents,"<title>Personality aspects of involvement in pilot error accidents</title> <abstract>The consistently high frequency of pilot error accidents in both military and civilian aviation programs does much to support exploratory research which might help alleviate the problem. Cattell's Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF), Mehrabian Achievement Scale, and a dynamic decision making task (under risk) were given to 51 Army aviators. Accident files were then examined in order to classify the aviators as to their prior pilot error accident involvement. Stepwise discriminant analyses revealed that the decision making task scores and the achievement scores were unrelated to the pilot error accident groupings while the 16 PF scores were able to correctly classify 86% of the aviators as to whether or not they had been previously listed as a cause factor in a military aviation accident.</abstract>"

1974,United States,Regularity in the control of the free running sleep wakefulness rhythm,"<title>Regularity in the control of the free running sleep wakefulness rhythm</title> <abstract>The natural tendency of humans to lengthen their sleep wakefulness cycle in environments which minimize natural cues to time of day poses problems for designing efficient work schedules. In the present experiment, rigid control over the sleep and wake up times was employed in an attempt to contain the natural rhythm to a 24 h cycle. Eight subjects were isolated from all time and social cues for 10 d. They were placed on a rigid schedule of sleep between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. The results indicate that, for practical purposes, the free running sleep wakefulness rhythm can be contained to a 24 hr cycle by rigid control of the sleep portion of the cycle. When part of the control was released by allowing the subjects to sleep beyond 7 a.m., they slept an average of 67 min longer and showed sleep latencies which averaged 73 min. From these data it is concluded that control of the sleep portion of the sleep wakefulness cycle, particularly control of the wake up time, is sufficient to contain the free running sleep wakefulness rhythm to a 24 hr cycle.</abstract>"

1973,United States,Aircraft as an instrument of self destruction,"<title>Aircraft as an instrument of self destruction</title> <abstract>Often the relationship between the pilot and his aircraft is such that the aircraft may be thought of as an extension of the pilot himself during the act of flight. If this pilot accumulates stress in his life with which he can no longer adequately cope, he may engage in self destructive acts, some of these within the context of his flying activities. The competent pilot practices and acquires skills which help him deal with the stress of demanding flight situations. However, if this individual exceeds his piloting capabilities, or is already coping with a high stress level to his maximum capacity, the additional stress of a particular flight may overload the total coping ability. Destruction of self, both psychologically and physically, will then most likely occur. Concepts and constructs of self destructive behavior, stress, coping mechanisms, competence and the myth of invulnerability are defined illustrated and related to the pilot population.</abstract>"
1973,United States,Social development of navy divers,"<title>Social development of navy divers</title> <abstract>Ninety five U.S. Navy divers and 93 fleet controls, matched for age, rate, pay grade, and the age at which they joined the Navy, were compared for several important biographical characteristics. The divers were found to be similar to controls in education, present marital status, educational level of parents, marital status of parents, number of brothers and sisters, number of moves made before joining the Navy, and size of hometown. The divers were significantly different from the fleet controls in running away from home, playing hookey, receiving traffic tickets and being arrested for nontraffic violations. These results show that divers rebelled early against the restrictions of formal social institutions, and were successful in directing this activity and aggression toward an occupation in which these characteristics may not only be useful, but necessary.</abstract>"
1973,United States,Human performance at elevated environmental temperatures,"<title>Human performance at elevated environmental temperatures</title> <abstract>A review of research on human performance at elevated temperatures is presented. The findings are analyzed in terms of 5 categories of performance measurements: time estimation; reaction time; vigilance and monitoring; tracking; and cognitive and other skilled tasks. Time estimation studies, requiring subjects to count or tap at specified rates, generally show increased speed of response with elevation of internal body temperature. Most studies of simple reaction time have also resulted in increased speed as either body or environmental temperatures are experimentally increased. Presumably both of these effects are a reflection of increased speed of neural conduction. Improvements in performance have also been found in measurements of vigilance, with optimum performance appearing at an Effective Temperature (ET) of about 80°F. For all other performance functions there appears to be a plateau, with only minor effects, up to an ET of about 85°F. As environmental temperatures exceed this value there are generally increasing performance decrements. This plateau up to 85°F ET appears to coincide very closely with the range over which the human body can compensate physiologically to elevated environmental temperatures.</abstract>"

Heart rates tend to stabilize at lower levels in zero gravity and electrical activity, except for occasional bigeminis and premature auricular and ventricular contractions (Apollo 15), is normal. Postflight, cardiac silhouette size is decreased. Reduced orthostatic tolerance is consistently found. Slight loss of bone mass has been observed as has decreased leg size and, in the 2 week Gemini flight, slightly negative nitrogen balance. Electrolyte changes parallel the time course of body weight loss and gain. Hormone changes are consistent with electrolyte changes. Growth of 'opportunistic' organisms is favored, with a resistance to antibiotics demonstrated by some. The number and distribution of microorganisms also change. Vestibular problems are minimal: adaptation appears to occur rapidly. Countermeasures to zero g effects are being explored. The use of lower body negative pressure is under investigation as a means of delaying, reducing, or preventing redistribution of the circulating blood volume in zero g. The use of medications is under investigation for, for example, cardiovascular and anti radiation protection. Vestibular preadaptation programs are being considered, particularly for non test pilot space travelers. In future, longer duration space flights, psychological variables may become increasingly significant. The effects of isolation, estrangement, and reduced privacy on crew stability are being studied. Crew composition is being reassessed with a view toward including female crew members. Improved sleeping accommodations, entertainment facilities, and food will be provided. Waste management and personal hygiene facilities, while still 'basic' by earth based standards, are being steadily improved. In the opinion of the author, 6 months of biomedical, psychological, and human factors data of the type that the Skylab program will begin to collect will be sufficient basis for predicting man's safe commitment to a Mars mission with appropriate understanding of the range of adaptational changes and use of countermeasures where they are found necessary.</abstract>"

The selection phases comprise cognitive and work sample tests, team exercises, and an interview with a final assessment by a selection board. DFS ATCO training consists of initial training (IT) and unit training (UT). For the first time, performance data from the UT were available. A validation sample of 603 ATCO trainees was used to analyze the selection and training data. Cognitive performance was predictive of IT criteria and work sample performance was predictive of both IT and UT criteria. Final selection board assessments showed predictive validity for training criteria. Overall, the validity of the DLR selection procedure was confirmed. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2025,Germany - Switzerland,The Invisible Copilot?: Assessing Task Engagement and Team Dynamics in a Virtual Flight Environment Using Eye-Tracking Metrics,"<title>The Invisible Copilot?: Assessing Task Engagement and Team Dynamics in a Virtual Flight Environment Using Eye-Tracking Metrics</title> <abstract>Gaze behavior represents a vital predictor of flight performance in pilots operating an aircraft. However, its role in collaborative settings with a copilot has been largely disregarded. Our study addressed this gap by simulating a flight environment with role division into a pilot flying (PF) and pilot monitoring (PM). Analyses of linear mixed-effects models revealed that different eye-tracking metrics significantly differed between the PF and the PM. Additionally, classification analysis revealed that these eye-tracking metrices were suitable for discerning between PF and PM with high predictive accuracy (97%) and precision (97%). We discuss implications for a role-based user state diagnosis for adaptive assistance system design in the cockpit, thereby advancing aviation safety. © 2025 The Author(s).</abstract>"
2025,France,Effect of Pilot Expertise on Visual Scanning and Precision of Flight Maneuvers in Military Aviation,"<title>Effect of Pilot Expertise on Visual Scanning and Precision of Flight Maneuvers in Military Aviation</title> <abstract>This study explored how expertise affects visual scanning strategies and the precision of flight maneuvers in military aviation. A total of 38 French Air Force pilots of three different expertise levels performed horizontal and vertical maneuvers in a flight simulator. Flight performance analysis showed that novices had larger deviations in roll, heading, and speed compared to cadets and experts, underlining the role of expertise on the precision of flight maneuvers. Eye-tracking analysis revealed that expert pilots used more efficient gaze strategies, focusing on key parameters such as pitch and power. Our results suggest that eye-tracking could significantly enhance pilot training by providing insights into expertisespecific visual behaviors. Future work will explore the use of real-time eye-tracking data to deliver immediate feedback, guiding pilots visual focus during training. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2025,France,Could Pilots and Controllers Learn to Adequately Trust Their Partners?: A First Experimental Response,"<title>Could Pilots and Controllers Learn to Adequately Trust Their Partners?: A First Experimental Response</title> <abstract>To find out whether it is possible to train pilots and controllers to adequately trust their partners, and thus modify their behavior and increase their performance, this study experimentally tested whether individuals disposition to trust is influenced by their social learning. Objective measurements related to the task to perform, collected over two successive phases, were used for two different groups of aviation staff. The results highlight a link between swift trust, supervision strategies, and time management and point to the social nature of the disposition to trust. This opens the way to a new experimental approach to the study of behaviors induced by interpersonal trust and to new pedagogical levers for optimizing the activity of ephemeral teams through training. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

2025,Australia,Pilot-Related Factors Involved in Runway Incursions: An Epidemiological Approach,"<title>Pilot-Related Factors Involved in Runway Incursions: An Epidemiological Approach</title> <abstract>Objective: This research investigates the role of pilot deviation in runway incursions, a persistent safety risk for aviation safety. Background: Despite many research efforts focusing primarily on the evaluation of advanced technical systems as mitigation solutions, there remains a significant lack of studies investigating the central figure in this issue: the pilot, as well as the underlying human factors and mitigating circumstances that contribute to runway incursions. Method: An in-depth analysis of incident and accident reports from 1993 to 2021, sourced from both Australia and the United States was employed. A comprehensive codebook was developed to capture key information for investigating significant relationships between variables. An extended taxonomy derived from the U.S. Department of Defence - DoD HFACS was used to systematically analyze pilot-related causal factors. Results: The results highlight critical causal factors from a human factors perspective, with wide-ranging issue such as miscommunication being prevalent. Statistically significant relationships were observed between the severity of runway incursions and other key factors. Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of considering pilot-related causal factors of runway incursions to gain better understanding of potential mitigation solutions. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2025,"Taiwan, Province of China",Gamification of Learning Aviation Knowledge for Improving the Efficiency of Flight Training,"<title>Gamification of Learning Aviation Knowledge for Improving the Efficiency of Flight Training</title> <abstract>Objective: The goal of the present study was to determine whether using gamification with the flexibility of board game design to prepare aviation cadets for future flight training could reduce their fatigue and stress from work overload and thereby decrease risk of human error leading to accidents. Background: Cadets need to have fully acquired aviation knowledge so as be able to access it spontaneously in decision-making when operating an aircraft and performing multi-tasks. The current tight training schedule and the need to immediately apply newly learned knowledge add considerable stress to the fatigue resulting from highly demanding physical training. Method: A board game involving specific content, rules, and contexts and incorporating competition and collaboration was designed. Results: The results showed that the learning effect of the game group was at least the same as, if not better than, traditional self-study. Both groups of cadets could retrieve their learning after two months. The game group was significantly more positive in their responses to the flow survey and expressed being in favor of learning by playing board games in the interviews. Conclusion: The findings suggest the feasibility of adjusting the current pilot training program by adopting game-based learning of aviation knowledge at an early stage for future use. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2025,Lithuania,A Comparative Study of Cognitive Abilities of Generation Y and Generation Z Pilot Candidates,"<title>A Comparative Study of Cognitive Abilities of Generation Y and Generation Z Pilot Candidates</title> <abstract>Objective: Training aviation specialists is a complex and rigorous process. According to statistics, 75% of incidents negatively impacting flight safety have been caused by human error. This article analyzes the admission process to aircraft piloting studies, which has remained unchanged over the last decade. Background: Various research results show variability between different generations’ abilities and achievements. It is unclear what differences emerge during the selection process to aircraft piloting studies. Methods: The admission process to aircraft piloting studies involves selecting the most capable young people between 18 and 20 years of age who have completed their secondary education and demonstrate that they possess the required abilities for such studies. Results: The tasks of the selection process are divided into four factors with the help of exploratory factor analysis–Initial information processing, 3D perception, 2D perception, and Level of analysis. The period analyzed includes representatives of Generation Y and Generation Z. The study results revealed statistically significant differences in the performance of the two generations. The results indicate that technology has a significant influence on the abilities of the candidates. Conclusions: Generation Y representatives excel in concentration and logical thinking, making fewer errors in such tasks. However, they demonstrate weaker performance in spatial thinking tasks. Conversely, Generation Z representatives outperform the former in spatial thinking and sequence arrangement tasks. However, they are prone to making more errors in tasks that demand high concentration and attention. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Deductive content analysis of online survey responses identified congruences with the extant literature. Commercial/financial and customer pressures were discovered as major external influences. Notably, pilots’ prior experience of similar conditions emerged as an important personal motivator that potentially leads to risk normalization. The findings underscore the interplay between multilevel influences and extrinsic/intrinsic safety motivations affecting pilots’ risk appraisal. The outcomes offer insights into the motivational orientations behind risk-taking intentions, offering an additional perspective on this complex aviation issue and contributing to efforts to reduce weather-related accidents.

2025,Iceland,Meta-Analysis of Age and Student Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) Training Outcomes,"<title>Meta-Analysis of Age and Student Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) Training Outcomes</title> <abstract>Some air navigation service providers (ANSPs) set a maximum age for entry into the air traffic controller (ATCO) occupation. Are such rules justified by empirical evidence? A recent meta-analysis of four studies reported no relationship between age at entry and training outcomes. Drawing on a larger number of studies (k = 8, N = 34,389) spanning 60 years, the age-training outcome relationship was investigated in a ""bare bones""random-effect meta-analysis (without correction for artifacts or moderator analyses). The mean correlation was = -.15 (SEρ =.04)[-.23, -.06] and was statistically different from 0 (Z = -3.39, p <.001). Overall, a small but significant negative correlation between age at entry and ATCO training outcomes was found. Practical implications for ANSPs are illustrated through utility analysis. © 2025 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2025,Netherlands - Romania,Anthropomorphic AI: Sociopathic AI Features as Predictors of Career Opportunities and Threats Perceived by Pilots in Commercial Aviation,"<title>Anthropomorphic AI: Sociopathic AI Features as Predictors of Career Opportunities and Threats Perceived by Pilots in Commercial Aviation</title> <abstract>Objective: The study aims to investigate how anthropomorphic, particularly sociopathic, features ascribed to AI affect commercial pilots’ perceptions of career threats, opportunities, and performance benefits of AI integration in the cockpit. Background: Although technology has long been an irreplaceable, valuable ally for airline pilots, artificial intelligence (AI) differs significantly from previously used technologies and pilots perceive AI not only as a tool but as an agent with human-like attributes. These anthropomorphic perceptions shape their career-related attitudes, especially as AI’s cognitive capabilities and ethical limitations challenge pilot identity. Methods: Survey data were collected from 363 commercial pilots and measures included anthropomorphic features ascribed to AI (including sociopathic AI features), perceived career threats and opportunities as well as expected performance enhancement due to AI. Regression and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. Background: Sociopathic AI features were positively associated with career threats and negatively with opportunities. Career opportunities significantly mediated the relationship between sociopathic features and perceived performance gains. Perceived career threats related to AI reduced performance expectations due to AI only when perceived career opportunities were low. Conclusions: The study offers a broad perspective on introducing artificial intelligence into the cockpit, considering commercial pilots' tendency to anthropomorphise AI. It seeks to ensure that AI can deliver operational benefits in safety and performance that meet the industry's and its end-users' needs, therefore addressing ethical concerns is critical for AI integration in aviation. © 2025 The Author(s).

2025,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",Relationships Between Pilot Gaze Patterns and Control Lapses in Challenging Instrument Approach Flight,"<title>Relationships Between Pilot Gaze Patterns and Control Lapses in Challenging Instrument Approach Flight</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates the link between pilot gaze patterns and control deviations during simulated instrument flight approaches, aiming to understand how attentional focus impacts flight safety. Background: Building on previous research that underscores the importance of situational awareness in aviation, this work delves into the specific aspects of gaze behavior as indicators of cognitive workload and attentional distribution. Unlike prior studies that broadly assessed attentional markers, this research utilizes advanced iris tracking technology to pinpoint how gaze metrics correlate with flight performance. Method: Employing a quantitative research design, the study analyzed over 45 simulated instrument flight approaches conducted by 15 pilots. Detailed metrics of gaze behavior, including fixation duration, saccade rate, scanning patterns, and gaze variability, were captured using iris tracking technology. A novel metric, exceedance autocorrelation, was introduced to assess aircraft control deviations and pilot performance. Results: Statistical analyses uncovered significant correlations: fixation duration exhibited a strong positive correlation with control quality (r = 0.684), and saccade rate correlated even more strongly (r = 0.827). Conversely, scan pattern predictability and gaze variability correlated negatively (r = −0.55) and positively (r = 0.546), respectively, highlighting their relevance under high cognitive workload conditions. Conclusion: The results confirms that specific gaze behaviors are critical indicators of pilot performance in challenging flight scenarios. These insights advance our understanding of pilot attentional mechanisms, offering valuable implications for enhancing aviation safety through improved training programs and cockpit technology design. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2025,United States,Total and Recent Flight Experience as Predictors of Pilot Instrument Performance,"<title>Total and Recent Flight Experience as Predictors of Pilot Instrument Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: The present research sought to investigate the impact of total flight time and recent flight time on instrument flight performance. Background: Studies that examined the impact of total flight time and recent flight time on pilot proficiency and have reported mixed results for both total time and recent flight time. The present study examined the impact of total and recent flight time along with vocabulary and mental rotation on instrument flight performance. Method: Thirty-nine instrument pilots were recruited from the aviation program at a midwestern university. All had successfully completed FAA approved instrument flight training. Each participant was required to conduct an instrument flight using an ELITE Personal Computer Aircraft Training Device (PCATD) to simulate instrument flight. The impact of total and recent flight time, total and recent instrument time (both actual and simulated), and recent instrument approaches along with vocabulary ability and mental rotation on instrument flight proficiency was examined using multiple regression procedures. Results: The results revealed no significant effect of any of the predictor variables on specific deviations from a perfect flight profile using several navigation measures. Pilot adherence to proper flight procedures was primarily predicted by mental rotation ability, vocabulary ability but not flight time. Mental rotation ability also predicted major flight errors. Conclusion: These results indicate that individual differences in instrument flight proficiency were predicted by vocabulary and mental rotation ability, while flight time (total or recent) had minimal impact on flight performance. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2025,United Kingdom,Single Pilot Concept of Operations: Hazard Identification and Mitigation Measures,"<title>Single Pilot Concept of Operations: Hazard Identification and Mitigation Measures</title> <abstract>Objective: This work identifies the human factors hazards associated with Single Pilot Operations (SiPO) in small jets currently certified for single-pilot operations and assesses their transferability to future airliner single-pilot concept. Background: SiPO of commercial airliners is imminent. Hazard identification of SiPO based upon an extant similar system could contribute to proving SiPO equally safe to multicrew operations (MCO). Method: The three-part study consisted of archival analysis of 47 accidents and 237 incident involving small single-pilot jets, subject matter expert (SME) interviews and an opinion survey of one hundred airline pilots. The multi-method approach provided holistic, complementary data, enabling findings to be triangulated. Results: Results identified the human factors hazards were mainly associated with the absence of a second crew member, specifically for: monitoring, workload management; situational awareness and verifying decision-making. SiPO acceptance was generally low amongst the airline pilot community. SJ pilots and airliner pilots favored a system configuration based around high levels of automation/autonomy rather than the displacement of the second pilot to the ground with on-demand availability (a distributed air/ground socio-technical system). Conclusion: In addition to the development of enabling technologies fundamental for de-crewing the need for further research into the design and development of single-pilot resource management (SRM) courses and definition of minimum flight experience for SiPO was recommended. © 2025 The Author(s).

Specifically, the consumer adoption process and the norm activation model are incorporated as the overarching theoretical model in consideration of the relative advantages of urban air mobility. Background: Urban air mobility, the next generation urban transport system, is all set to fly. Urban air mobility is a notable disruptive innovation in aviation and mobility system as a sustainable means of transportation. Method: Using a quantitative procedure, we developed the theoretical framework based on the existing theories and examined hypotheses using structural equation modeling and invariance test. Results: The findings indicate that the adoption intention toward urban air mobility is driven by problem recognition, awareness, interest, evaluation, ascribed responsibility, and personal norms. In addition, the relative advantage of urban air mobility moderates the relationships between interest and evaluation, and between ascribed responsibility and personal norms. Conclusion: Based on the empirical evidence, this study discusses the findings and subsequent implications for academia. We also address the opportunities for governmental organizations and industry to maximize the utilization of urban air mobility in order to make a city more convenient, cleaner, faster, greener, and safer. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2025,United States,"Two Theories, Two Tests, One Outcome: Indifference of the Indicator","<title>Two Theories, Two Tests, One Outcome: Indifference of the Indicator</title> <abstract>Objective: This study sought to investigate if the constructs measured by the MAB II and the MicroCog are related. The similarity of two tests designed using two theories was examined. Background: Distinctions between tests of general cognitive ability (g) versus specific abilities (s) have been investigated for over a century. The Multidimensional Aptitude Battery used the individual differences psychometric approach while the MicroCog used a brain-behavior relationships approach. The authors of the tests claim they measure differing constructs based on differing theories; individual differences versus brain-behavior relations. Methods: Both tests were administered to 10,612 participants. Correlations suggested the tests shared a common source of variance for the constructs measured. Confirmatory factor analyses established this and established a hierarchical structure with g at the apex. The test designed to measure specific abilities (MicroCog) measured a single factor, g. Results: Although different theories underlie their respective construction methods, results indicated the two tests measured much in common; that is, two theories, one outcome. Conclusions: Despite the assertions of the publishers of the two tests of differences, practitioners gain little by using both tests as they both measure the same constructs. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Beyond the visual line of sight, UAV missions require an airspace observer, who may fail to provide accurate traffic information. This work proposes a novel traffic display design that provides conflict and avoidance maneuver guidance in addition to information on surrounding traffic. In a human-in-the-loop experiment, UAV pilots perception of surrounding traffic using the novel display was evaluated against that of a perfect airspace observer (baseline condition).

2024,Brazil,"Stress, Resilience, and Organizational Climate: A Study with Pilots of the Brazilian Air Force","<title>Stress, Resilience, and Organizational Climate: A Study with Pilots of the Brazilian Air Force</title> <abstract>Organizational climate, stress, resilience, and cortisol measures were investigated in pilots of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). Studies indicate that these variables may be related to the physical and mental health, quality of life, and work of these professionals. A total of 112 FAB pilots participated in this study. A sociodemographic and professional questionnaire, the Resilience Scale, Lipps Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults (ISSL), and the Organizational Climate Scale were used. In addition, blood samples were taken to check the pilots cortisol levels. According to the ISSL, 48 (42.86%) participants were found to be stressed and 64 (57.14%) were not stressed. In addition, the results showed that the better the perception of organizational climate, the lower the level of stress; and the better the perception of organizational climate, the greater the level of resilience and the fewer the stress symptoms. Most of those who had higher values in the perception of a good organizational climate and level of resilience had cortisol levels in the normal range. There was no significant correlation between stress and cortisol levels. Actions are suggested for developing resilience and paying attention to the organizational climate, aimed at enhancing the quality of life of pilots as well as flight safety. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,United Kingdom,Competency-Based Peer Support in Aviation: A Framework for Training Peers Within Peer Support Programs,"<title>Competency-Based Peer Support in Aviation: A Framework for Training Peers Within Peer Support Programs</title> <abstract>In July 2018, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (2018) issued Regulation (EU) 2018/1042, now (EU) 2020/745, which required all commercial air transport operators to implement a support program by February 14, 2021. This was initially aimed at pilots and formed part of the recommendations made after the pilot murder-suicide crash of Germanwings flight 9525 in March 2015. Pilot peer support is now considered vital in supporting crew well-being and in promoting aviation safety, alongside other initiatives (Federal Aviation Administration, 2024). To date, there has been scant published literature on the provision of pilot peer support beyond the rationale for its inception. This In Practice paper offers guidance for a competency-based framework for training and benchmarking pilot peers and draws on the familiar framework to pilots of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) pilot competencies (ICAO, 2013). This conceptualization of peer competencies offers a framework for pilot peers in the acquisition of core peer support skills, and for those training pilot peers, a yardstick by which skills acquisition can be assessed. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,Ireland,How Pilot Fatigue Affects Operational Flight Risk in Scheduled Commercial Aviation,"<title>How Pilot Fatigue Affects Operational Flight Risk in Scheduled Commercial Aviation</title> <abstract>Pilot fatigue remains a hazard in scheduled commercial aviation, contributing to 31 aircraft accidents between 2005 and 2022, according to International Air Transport Association statistics (2023). Therefore, this study further investigated fatigue and its impact on operational flight risk in commercial aviation. More than 16,000 safety reports were analyzed using mixed methods. The results showed that fatigue-related occurrences were more likely to be reported confidentially. Factors contributing to an increased risk of fatigue included pilots personal factors, inadequate rest periods, or poor hotel environments. Fatigue was observed in 6% of all safety-related occurrences analyzed, but these events consumed 9% of the airlines risk budget. Further empirical research is required focusing on the influence of pilots personal factors on fatigue risk. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,Finland - United Kingdom,Comparison of In-Flight and Post-Flight Use of NASA-TLX,"<title>Comparison of In-Flight and Post-Flight Use of NASA-TLX</title> <abstract>The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of airborne assignment of NASA-TLX scores. A total of 21 participants flew two simulated flying missions. In both missions, the participants' task was to fly an instrument landing system (ILS) approach, followed by a stabilized climbing turn maneuver. In one mission, the participants evaluated their mental workload on the ILS approach and assigned the NASA-TLX scores during the climbing turn maneuver. In the other mission, the same tasks were conducted after the simulated flying task. The participants' NASA-TLX scores and flying performance between missions were compared. There was no significant difference in the participants' flying performance between missions. There were no significant differences in either NASA-TLX scores or overall indices between two missions. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,United States,Development and Validation of a General Aviation Risk Perception Scale,"<title>Development and Validation of a General Aviation Risk Perception Scale</title> <abstract>The aim of this study was to develop a psychometric tool for measuring pilot perceptions of risk, with a focus on risk in general aviation (GA) flying. Unlike other objective protocols that pilots adhere to (e.g., checklists), assessing and responding to risk is a subjective task, making it challenging to evaluate. Previous research has developed scales that are either too generalized or have poor psychometric properties (i.e., reliability and validity). Therefore, this effort intended to develop a validated scale utilizing psychometrically sound methods, including literature review, item generation, subject matter expert review, item pool truncation, data collection, and analysis. Results confirmed a statistically valid and reliable 15-item scale - the General Aviation Risk Perception Scale - explicitly for pilots and GA-related risk. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,Germany,Triggering Cockpit Alerts Using an Eye-Tracking-Based Measure of Monitoring Performance,"<title>Triggering Cockpit Alerts Using an Eye-Tracking-Based Measure of Monitoring Performance</title> <abstract>This study explored the potential for enhancing pilot performance via an alerting system that adapts according to an eye-trackingbased measure of monitoring. The novel measure combines gaze analysis with system state assessment to estimate the pilot's understanding of the current system state. On this basis, an alerting system was developed to direct pilot attention to unnoticed system state changes, thereby improving system state monitoring. In a flight simulator study involving 10 participants in a generic jet cockpit, we compared the adaptive alerting system with a no-assistance condition. Although alerting improved the participants' performance in two tracking tasks, it adversely impacted performance in a third task. Nonetheless, alerting resulted in a decrease in both variance and mean detection time of critical changes. Participants' subjective ratings were generally positive, yet they criticized the lack of transparency of the alerting mechanism. Alerts triggered based on eye-tracking and system state show potential for improving operator task performance. Nonetheless, for the system to reach its full performance potential, it is critical that the operator understand the principles underlying the alert triggers. False positives and alert design were identified as key areas for improvement to maintain user trust and task flow. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,United Kingdom,Development and Proof of Concept of a Predictive Model of Flight Deck Cognitive Workload,"<title>Development and Proof of Concept of a Predictive Model of Flight Deck Cognitive Workload</title> <abstract>Workload can be regarded as the 'cost' (in information processing terms) of performing a given flight task. Predictive models of workload are valuable at the early stages of system design to identify potentially excessive demands on the human operator before major system development commences. This paper describes the early development of a task-based predictive workload method. It utilizes a scenario-based timeline analysis supplemented by characterizations of the cognitive nature of the pilot's tasks using Wickens' multiple resource theory, followed by the identification of likely task conflicts and estimates of the influence of the task environment. Workload predictions were made for a manual approach, landing and roll-out scenario in a modern airliner. Predictions were compared against corresponding Bedford scale workload estimates. Results show that the predictive workload technique produced comparable estimates of cognitive workload measured using the Bedford scale. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

The arrangement included two mirrored nightshift types, with sleep and operational phases alternating once mid-shift. Sleep duration, subjective sleepiness, and fatigue as well as sustained attention, which have not been thoroughly studied to date, were examined. The findings suggest different sleep strategies. Working during the second part of the night resulted in reduced sleep duration before the shift. Subjective fatigue exhibited varying patterns depending on the shift type and time, with elevated fatigue observed at the start and middle of the shift. However, subjective sleepiness and sustained attention were primarily influenced by the passage of time. © 2024 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2024,Norfolk Island - United States,"Number of Interrupting Events Influences Response Time in Multitasking, but not Trust in Automation","<title>Number of Interrupting Events Influences Response Time in Multitasking, but not Trust in Automation</title> <abstract>Objective: The present study examined how the number of interrupting events (interruption load) influences the effect of task load on human-automation trust and resource allocation in a low-fidelity flight simulation environment. Background: Trust is one critical factor that influences successful human-automation interaction. In the previous research, operators reported lower trust scores and made fewer fixation toward an automated system, which assisted a task, when competing task in the same workspace demanded more attention from the operator. However, it is unclear whether human-automation trust is influenced by frequent shift of attention away from a task assisted by an automated signaling system. Methods: Participants concurrently performed a tracking task, a system monitoring task, and a communication task. An automated signaling system was employed to assist the system monitoring task with 70% reliability. Task load was manipulated by the difficulty of the tracking task while interruption load was manipulated by the varying the frequency of auditory messages in the communication task. Results: Results demonstrated an effect of task load on human-automation trust and resource allocation, replicating previous findings. Further, participants responded faster to an auditory message that occurred less frequently when performing a tracking task at the low difficulty level but automation trust did not vary. Conclusion: While operators reported higher trust levels to imperfect automation under lower task load, number of interrupting events does not influence their trust. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Method: This was a single-subject changing criterion design with six participants. Three target vowels and one control vowel were selected for each participant. Mono and bi-syllabic target words were selected from aviation textbooks recommended by the flight academy. Visual feedback and placement cues were provided to assist with each participant’s vowel productions. The Pierson Aviation English Questionnaire (PAEQ), a pre- and post-measure, was also administered. Results: All participants demonstrated gains in PVC at the three levels of difficulty. Participants reported decreased anxiety levels when speaking with native speakers, air traffic controllers, and flight instructors. All pilot candidates reported increased self-confidence levels when using aviation phraseology and an increase in enjoyment when speaking English. Conclusion: This investigation was the first of its kind to evaluate the effectiveness of vowel-centered accent modification in pilot candidates. It was also the first investigation to demonstrate the usefulness of skilled speech-language pathology intervention and the positive effect on improving intelligibility of second-language English speakers in aviation. © 2024 Katie R.

2024,Turkey,Effects of Aerobic Capacity on Cognitive Functions During Hypoxia,"<title>Effects of Aerobic Capacity on Cognitive Functions During Hypoxia</title> <abstract>Objective: We aimed to investigate the role of aerobic capacity on cognitive functions during hypoxic conditions. Background: Possessing a mishap risk in aviation, acute hypobaric hypoxia has some negative effects on cognitive functions. Therefore, it is important to develop hypoxia tolerance to preserve the mental functions of pilots against possible hypoxic conditions during flight. Method: A total of 25 pilot candidates were included in this study. The subjects were dichotomized into two groups as high-fit and low-fit according to aerobic capacities. Hypoxia was applied at an altitude equivalent pressure of 18,000 ft. Go/NoGo and Digit Span cognitive tests were applied in two phases before hypoxia training and during hypoxia. Results: In the low-fit group, for the Go/NoGo test parameters, the mean R-Go reaction time increased significantly during hypoxia when compared to before hypoxia training. Additionally, in the low-fit group for the Digit Span test parameters, the memory span and the sum of correct answers both decreased significantly during hypoxia. In the high-fit group, there was no significant difference between the two test parameters during hypoxia. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that physical fitness has a positive effect on the deterioration of cognitive functions during hypoxia. It could be useful to suggest regular physical exercise habits for aircrews to increase their acute hypoxia tolerance in terms of cognitive function. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Self-efficacy and safety climate are essential for the flight performance of pilots. However, the effect of self-control on flight performance has yet to be studied. In addition, high self-efficacy is always determined as an essential risk for aviation, but this reality has yet to be researched regarding the safety climate. Method: This study employs qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Data are obtained from 244 pilot candidates training in flight schools in Turkey and then analyzed. Results: There is a significant relationship between self-perceptions and flight performance of pilot candidates. Safety climate has a moderator role in the relationship between self-efficacy, self-control, and flight performance. In the second research model, it is determined that there is a significant relationship between safety climate and flight performance. Self-control and self-efficacy of pilot candidates moderate this relationship. Conclusion: Flight schools and airline companies should exert more effort to establish a safety culture within their institutions, particularly for individuals with excessive levels of self-efficacy. Excessive self-efficacy poses a significant potential risk for those who need to perceive safety culture more in their flight school. In addition, the pilot candidates’ self-control level should be considered necessary when recruiting them. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

To realize alternations in technicians’ cognition and habit in executing routine checks is vital to identify and set training principles during starting stages of type changes. Method: This study compiled possible alterations for A350XWB maintenance from senior practitioners and then conducted a comprehensive survey of China Airlines A-check crew members. A ranked pair-wise comparison (RPC) approach distinguished the priorities of gaps in crew cognition differences and habit changes. Results: Fuselage anti-collision regulation resulted in larger gaps in cognition and habits. Procedures for powering the electrical system on and off, concepts for fuselage structure and materials, and reports of visual inspection procedures after collisions were the sub-criteria with the most significant changes for all respondents. Senior technicians presented more significant cognition differences with juniors in regulations for safety ranges between ground equipment and fuselage. Crew accumulating specific working experience performed more cautiously and carefully. Conclusion: New knowledge and procedures generated alternations of the crew’s cognition and habit in implementing A350XWB A-checks than previous types. This study identified the relative gaps in practical operations. Airlines must be continuously aware of these gaps in aircraft maintenance during aircraft type changes. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: The FAS measures the anxiety levels in different flight situations, while FAM assesses the somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety or anticipatory anxiety in different flight situations. The FAS and the FAM have been adapted to different cultures and used in different studies. Method: 645 adults from different regions of Turkey participated in this study (M<inf>age</inf> = 25.58, SD<inf>age</inf> = 10.43, 59.2% women). A Socio-demographic Information Form, the Visual Analog Flight Anxiety Scale (VAFAS), the FAS, the FAM and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used for data collection. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed that the Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM had similar factor structures to the original forms. The FAS consisted of three factors and the FAM consisted of two factors with factor loadings between.56 and.85. High Cronbach’s alpha scores (.78–.97) of the FAS, the FAM and their subscales supported internal consistency reliability. Convergent and discriminant validity of the scales were supported with correlation analysis and independent samples t-test. Conclusion: The Turkish forms of the FAS and the FAM provided psychometrically sound self-report measures of flight anxiety. It is thought that these measures will be useful in clinical assessments, interventions and future cross-cultural research about flight anxiety in the Turkish community. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Live Virtual Constructive in Large Force Exercises: Perceived and Expected Training Value</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates whether and how perceived training value varies among fighter pilots participating in a large force exercise (LFE), and whether they expect Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) training to enhance training value of future LFEs. Background: LVC technology is maturing but its expected training value is under-investigated, especially regarding future LVC in LFEs. Method: Fighter pilots at a Live-flying LFE answered questionnaires, 120 responses were analyzed statistically. The questions focused on whether the sortie they just flew provided training value, generally and for specific Desired Learning Objectives (DLOs), on whether the inclusion of Virtual and Constructive entities in future LFEs would contribute to training value generally and to the DLOs specifically, and on specific LVC implementation issues. Results: Ratings of experienced training value varied across DLOs, and DLO ratings varied across Mission types. Fighter pilots were positive toward including Virtual and Constructive entities in LFEs for certain DLOs, mostly for flying a complex mission. DLOs covaried around the factors of LVC-tradeoff advantages and Live advantages, as well as temporal dimensions of planning before a mission and stages of engagement. LVC implementation lessons were extracted. Conclusion: Fighter pilots are generally moderately positive about LVC in LFEs. The measurement of perceived training value per DLO seems a relevant instrument for investigating perceived training value of an LFE and expected training value of future LVC training. © 2023 Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI.

The work of civil aviation pilots has to face pressure from families, individuals, companies and other multi-faceted sources. Therefore, it may lead to negative work behaviors and performance, and even further affect flight safety. Objective: The study investigates the relationship between role stress, emotional exhaustion, and well-being of among civil aviation pilots. Additionally, this study determines whether leisure participation moderates the relationship between emotional exhaustion and well-being. Methods: Participants were 249 Taiwanese pilots, who were administered questionnaires that measured role conflict, role ambiguity, well-being, and leisure participation. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was utilized to analyze data in this study. Results: Role stress had a significant effect on emotional exhaustion which had a significant effect on well-being among the pilots. Leisure participation moderated in reducing negative influence of emotional exhaustion on well-being. Conclusion: These findings regarding the negative impact of pilots’ negative emotional state on their work performance can serve as a reference point for informing human resource management strategies that focus on enhancing well-being among pilots. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

It is therefore important to understand how pilots interact with technology, particularly in general aviation. This study explored whether the affect heuristic influenced pilots' perceptions of the benefits and risks of five cockpit technologies available in general aviation, with a particular focus on technologies that may assist weather-related decision-making. Evidence from a series of scenario-based tasks suggests that the perceived risks and benefits of the technology were associated with pilot affect, whereby positive feelings toward a given technology were associated with a lower perceived risk, such as accidentally flying into adverse weather, and higher perceived benefits, such as helping to maintain control while completing concurrent tasks. Findings also suggest that affect and perceived risks can be manipulated by negatively framed prior information. The practical implications of the effect of the affect heuristic on the successful introduction of new technologies and the promotion of safety initiatives in general are discussed. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

Similarly, there is scarce investigation of situational awareness (SA) in a VRFS. Consequently, this paper discusses an experiment that explored presence and SA in a VRFS. Physiological responses are also captured. The results reveal that participants felt a high degree of presence in a VRFS, and felt immersed and involved. The sense of presence contributed to good SA, and physiological data identified increased stress levels. These results are an important step in the exploration of VR in the field of aviation training.

In the current study we examined fatigue perceptions and mitigation strategies before and during mission execution with questionnaires from 44 volunteers from a US Air Force air mobility squadron. Results suggest that fatigue is a serious safety-of-flight concern for the community; however, crews generally did not reference the available fatigue risk management (FRM) tool for missions. Aircrew member characteristics were associated with differences in fatigue-related perceptions and mitigation strategies. Crews used various personal fatigue mitigation strategies and had habitual stimulant and depressant consumption during missions based on daily routines.

Two groups of 20 airline pilots received stall recovery training in a moving-base simulator. The “delayed-response” group induced the stall themselves. The “immediate-response” group was presented with paused situations and had to recover immediately after unpausing. In a surprising transfer test, the pilots in the delayed-response group showed less aggressive unloading, and experienced significantly more time pressure compared to the pilots in the immediate-response group. In a stall cue recognition test, the delayed-response group performed nearly significantly better. We conclude that experiencing the progression of an aerodynamic stall during training has positive effects on pilot performance, even if this requires unprocedural behavior. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

Background: There is little research into the human factors of HEMS operations. Weather, fuel planning, fatigue, and pressure are prominent human factors found in HEMS operations globally. Method: The research methodology involves primary data through a tailored human factors survey of HEMS staff in Australia, and secondary data from historical ATSB (Australian Transport Safety Bureau) accident reports involving HEMS operations. Results: Results from a survey, as well as secondary data, show that Australian HEMS is in line with global trends, regularly encounter issues related to weather, fatigue and feelings of pressure. Weather factors were the most encountered event by most Australian HEMS crews surveyed. The likelihood of an individual committing an error or violation was increased when they felt pressure to complete the task. The cause of the pressure was found to be unique to HEMS operations with the condition of the patient being the most common. However, the source of the pressure was equally attributed to self-imposed pressure and pressure imposed by others. Years of experience in HEMS operations is identified in reducing exposure to some of the investigated hazards and human factors. Conclusion: The weather situation, fatigue and feelings of pressure were the three main human factor issues in Australian HEMS. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

This research study utilizes HFACS to classify the ASRS safety reports to identify key indicators in General Aviation (GA) non-fatal accidents and incidents. Qualitative data analysis reveals relationships between incidents and causal factors, indicating 53% of incidents to be perceptual errors, 32% decision errors, and 26% skill-based errors. Prevalent preconditions for these errors include crew resource management (53%), physical environment (32%), and technological environment (16%). The study aligns with previous research findings, suggesting that crew resource management is a common factor in both GA incidents and commercial and military aviation. While GA pilots may make different types of errors, such discrepancies are not prevalent in the voluntarily reported data. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Under the threat of COVID-19, the airline industry experienced unprecedented challenging times. Specifically, job security among airline employees was increasingly uncertain. Method: Using survey methods, we developed the theoretical framework based on the theory of planned behavior and tested it using structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis. Results: The results successfully embraced the process of volitional and non-volitional behaviors from its constituents. In addition, airline crew loyalty intention was influenced by company image and subjective well-being through attitude and job satisfaction. Lastly, perceived job insecurity moderated the relationships between variables, and the impact of employee attitude on job satisfaction and loyalty intention differed before and after COVID-19. Conclusion: The developed theoretical framework sufficiently accounted for airline employees’ loyalty intentions. As a result, the findings of this research help researchers and practitioners find efficient ways of boosting airline crews’ positive attitude and loyalty in the post-COVID-19 era. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2023,Finland - United Kingdom,Team Performance in Air Combat: A Teamwork Perspective,"<title>Team Performance in Air Combat: A Teamwork Perspective</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe a model combining taskwork and teamwork of a single-seat fighter aircraft team, or flight, during its performance episode. Background: In air combat, evaluations of team performance have focused on task performance. However, both teamwork and taskwork are required for high performance output. Attempts to address taskwork and teamwork in single-seat fighter aircraft flights have mainly settled for adopting existing models of teamwork to flights. As such, they have overlooked the unique nature of teamwork in air combat. Method: Existing models of teamwork and taskwork are reviewed and a flight’s tactical decision-making is described as an input-process-output model. A model combining flight’s teamwork, taskwork, situation awareness and transactive memory is conceptualized and operation of the model is illustrated with a case study. In the case study, the model is used to provide an alternative explanation for an air combat accident. Results: The model bridges the gap between the well-established concepts of teamwork and the unique nature of air combat. It rationalizes how the mission essential competencies, situation awareness and transactive memory interact with each other, and how they impact the flight’s performance output. Conclusions: The model helps scholars and practitioners in identifying the connection between the flight’s performance output and the underlying processes even when cause and effect are not adjacent in either time or space. © 2023 The Author(s).

2023,Hong Kong,The Effects of Aeronautical Decision-Making Models on Student Pilots’ Situational Awareness and Cognitive Workload in Simulated Non-Normal Flight Deck Environment,"<title>The Effects of Aeronautical Decision-Making Models on Student Pilots’ Situational Awareness and Cognitive Workload in Simulated Non-Normal Flight Deck Environment</title> <abstract>Objective: This paper investigates the effects of using different decision-making models on pilots’ performance while facing non-normal flight circumstances. Background: The captain must quickly make appropriate decisions once an aircraft faces emergency. Usually, human error is one primary cause of accidents, which inevitably affects the captain’s decision progress. Method: Ten participants carried out a standard non-normal scenario (cargo smoke). Each participant is equipped with simulation experience and executed three sessions using three different decision models: the DOGAM, DECIDE, and CLEAR. After each session, the situation awareness (SA) and perceived workload were assessed using the Situational Awareness Rating Technology (SART) and NASA-TLX. An in-depth interview was also completed to comprehend their subjective perception of decision-making. Results: Although the CLEAR outperformed the other models in SART and NASA-TLX scores, their performance regarding workload and SA was comparable. The fixing time of DOGAM was the longest, and the other two models were no significant difference. Subjectively, the DECIDE may require a high mental demand by simultaneously processing lots of information and measuring significant changes, whilst the DOGAM may encourage participants follow their own idea, promoting aggressive decisions. Conclusion: This paper clarifies the importance of incorporating decision models into the cockpit and investigates the relatively feasible decision-making model. Variation across our results illustrated applying different decision models to train pilots and solve problems is suggested, thereby improving flight safety. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2023,United Kingdom,It Was This Wing Wasn’t It? Identifying the Importance of Verbal Communication in Aviation Maintenance,"<title>It Was This Wing Wasn’t It? Identifying the Importance of Verbal Communication in Aviation Maintenance</title> <abstract>To place communication in context against other maintenance error promoting contributory factors and identify whether communication issues were written or verbal, a semi-structured interview schedule was used to ask 40 aircraft maintenance personnel what goes wrong when maintaining aircraft. Participants described 746 examples of contributory factors and undesired outcomes which were categorized using Dupont’s “dirty dozen.” 147 of the 746 descriptions were communication factors, of which 99 were verbal, 34 were written and 14 were general. Of 34 verbal and 19 written task miscommunication examples, 22 verbal and 10 written were accompanied by descriptions of undesired outcomes. The results suggest that commercial aircraft maintainers consider verbal and written communication as more important than other contributory factors. © 2023 The Author(s).

2023,Germany,"The Relationship between Preparation, Impression Management, and Interview Performance in High-Stakes Personnel Selection: A Field Study of Airline Pilot Applicants","<title>The Relationship between Preparation, Impression Management, and Interview Performance in High-Stakes Personnel Selection: A Field Study of Airline Pilot Applicants</title> <abstract>Objective: The present study investigates how airline pilot applicants prepare for a personnel selection procedure and how this relates to their deceptive and honest impression management (IM) in the job interview and their interview performance. Background: It is thus far unclear how preparation relates to IM in real-world and high-stakes settings. This is of particular importance for the aviation industry, because numerous commercial providers offer preparation courses for selection procedures potentially impacting selection decisions. Method: We conducted a field study of high-stakes job interviews embedded in a selection procedure for airline pilots. Data from 100 interviewees was acquired. Results: The variety of preparation strategies an applicant used was positively correlated with two deceptive IM (faking) strategies in the job interview. Moreover, low effort preparation via social media and guidebooks was positively correlated with overall faking. The variety of preparation and preparation via social media were also positively correlated with honest IM. However, neither the aforementioned preparation nor IM showed significant correlations with the interview performance. Conclusion: The effects of preparation depend on the specific preparation methods used. Certain methods of preparation are positively associated with applicants’ use of IM strategies in the job interview. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2023,Australia,"Miscommunication in Commercial Aviation: The Role of Accent, Speech Rate, Information Density, and Politeness Markers","<title>Miscommunication in Commercial Aviation: The Role of Accent, Speech Rate, Information Density, and Politeness Markers</title> <abstract>Objective: This study is specifically designed to examine the effect of accent (native or non-native English sounding), rate of speech, complexity of transmission (information density), and politeness markers on commercial pilot (mis)communication. Background: Aviation accident reports often cite miscommunication as a contributing factor. Anecdotal reports from pilots, along with limited empirical studies on pilot communication, further confirm that miscommunication remains a problem. Method: Approximately 250 ATC-Pilot transmissions from each of four international airports: Kingsford Smith, Sydney, Australia (YSSY); Hong Kong International Airport (VHHH); Los Angeles International Airport, USA (KLAX); and Haneda, Tokyo, Japan (RJTT) were analyzed. Pilot communication errors were compared between the four locations based on pilot and ATC accent alignment, rate of speech, number and order of items in transmission, and politeness markers. Results: Native English-sounding pilots committed more errors than accented pilots. Alignment of pilot and ATC language background reduced communication errors, but not when native English speakers were involved. Longer messages increased the number of communication errors. Politeness markers did not affect communication and pilots committed fewer errors when the readback order was not scrambled. Conclusion: Communication errors still occur in ATC-Pilot radio communication. These errors appear more common with native English sounding pilots than accented pilots. Hence, the origin of the problem appears to stem from proficiency in the lingua franca of Aviation English, rather than with the English language. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2023,United States,Integrated Modeling of Fatigue Impacts on C-17 Approach and Landing Performance,"<title>Integrated Modeling of Fatigue Impacts on C-17 Approach and Landing Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: The current effort develops an initial integrated model of fatigue in the context of C-17 approach and landing operations. Specifically, we integrate a biomathematical fatigue model with a task network model to estimate pilot performance degradation. Background: Fatigue risk management is a critical process in aviation and flight deck operations, given its dramatic impact on aviation safety and pilot health. Biomathematical fatigue models are useful tools in several aviation fatigue risk management programs that can be embedded in electronic device applications. However, these tools are limited in terms of identifying specific performance outcomes affected by fatigue, as well as individualizing fatigue estimates to individual pilots. Integrating computational cognitive models and biomathematical fatigue models can help address these issues. Methods: Forty-four aircrew members completed the study with 10 performing 33 landings with sets of corresponding actigraph data and C-17 performance metrics. We developed a task network model of C-17 approach and landing operations and integrated biomathematical fatigue model predictions based on actigraph data from the aircrew. We then compared predictions from this integrated model with C-17 performance metrics from the missions. Results: We successfully predicted delays in setting flaps, landing gear, and engaging the speed brake. Conclusion: After further development and validation, this integrated model can be implemented within an application to provide real-time information on pilot fatigue and expected performance on specific aircraft operations. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

2023,United States,Towards Human Objective Real-Time Trust of Autonomy Measures for Combat Aviation,"<title>Towards Human Objective Real-Time Trust of Autonomy Measures for Combat Aviation</title> <abstract>Objective: Can objective trust indicators be measured and computed in real time in a within visual range aerial combat “dogfight” scenario consisting of a manned autonomous own-ship versus an adversary? Background: Previous research has focused on human trust of automation during simulated ground combat and human trust of civil aviation automation. Those studies largely consisted of subjective measures of trust analyzed post-hoc. Human trust of autonomy in high-risk situations such as dogfighting had not yet been studied. Method: Nine evaluation pilots participated in an experiment that consisted of nine operationally relevant live-flight vignettes during which they conducted a mission manager task while simultaneously monitoring an autonomous agent controlling their own-ship in an aerial dogfight. Eye tracking, objective real-time mental workload, and mission manager task performance were all recorded. Results: Potential indicators of trust were objectively measured in real-time as a function of autonomy disengagement, human cross-check ratio of autonomy, and real-time objective mental workload, as validated by traditional subjective trust measures. Measured trust still needs to be categorized as appropriate trust, overtrust, or undertrust in future work. Conclusion: This first-ever real-time measure of objective indicators of trust in operationally relevant live-flight paves the way for determining appropriate human trust of autonomy in high-risk situations such as dogfighting. These measures could have utility in high-risk manned-unmanned teaming applications such as working with robots and automated trading. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2022,France,Time Course of Anticipation in Pilots' Beyond-Visual-Range Situation Awareness,"<title>Time Course of Anticipation in Pilots' Beyond-Visual-Range Situation Awareness</title> <abstract>The study presented here aims to objectively measure the persistence in time of situation awareness (SA) in beyond-visual-range (BVR) situations. How long does a pilot maintain SA of air traffic communicated by radio? Overall, 63 participants (non-pilot and pilot trainees) had to position air traffic on a map based on radio calls. This study presents two new findings: (1) The spatial representation developed from audioverbal information has an anticipatory component and (2) this anticipation is time-bound. These results are encouraging for the development of an objective method measuring the factors that enhance or impair the anticipation of SA such as the division of attention. This study could lead to new aeronautical rules specifying how long a BVR situation can be held. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

The selection includes paper-and-pencil tests, computer-based tests, and an interview. A total of 188 candidates participated in the validation study. The total test score predicted the results of three exams in aviation theory (r = .27-.38) and extra flying hours needed (-.22), but not mean university grade. The regression analyses indicated that all predictors (tests and interview ratings) explained 25% of the variance in aviation theory, 19% in extra flying hours needed, and 7% in mean university grade. The overall findings confirmed the predictive validity of selection tests, especially the computer-based tests. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

Test-retest data were obtained at different intervals. COR predicted time to solo (N = 119, r = -.15, p < .05) and time to the private pilot certificate (N = 51, r = -.34, p < .01). WR did not correlate with any performance measure. Test-retest reliabilities averaged across 17 months were r = .604 for COR and r = .431 for WR, with p < .0001 for both. A factor analysis of the test-retest data demonstrated that WR and COR loaded on different factors, indicating that they assess different attributes. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

This research used Boeing's Maintenance Error Decision Aid (MEDA) to categorize 138 aviation maintenance accident, incident, and occurrence report narratives. Analyses of contingency tables using Pearson's chi-square, lambda, and odds ratio statistics revealed that a modest frequency of communication was highly significantly associated with leadership and supervision, individual factors, and technical knowledge contributory factors. The results demonstrate that use of these analyses goes beyond frequency and singular associative methods to identify the presence and strength of associations between contributory factors. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

The Sycopaero interface was designed to limit the PF's workload by automatically displaying thrust and pitch values specific to aircraft configuration on the primary flight display. Participants performed a simulated flight scenario in which they lost airspeed information during take-off with and without the Sycopaero interface. Both behavioral and ocular results demonstrate that the Sycopaero interface significantly lowers the mental workload of PFs and improves their monitoring performance. Taken together, these results suggest that the Sycopaero interface may be a suitable solution to safely handle airspeed failures. © 2022 Hogrefe. All Rights Reserved.</abstract>"

Providing passengers with a pleasant acoustic environment without adding weight to the cabin structure is a field of tension that challenges cabin interior designers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether noise levels affect the comfort and physical discomfort experienced by airplane passengers, and whether control influences comfort perception. To this end, 30 participants experienced three conditions (silence, aircraft engine noise at 75 dB, and the same noise with the ability to use earplugs), and comfort and discomfort were measured using a questionnaire. It was concluded that aircraft engine noise negatively affected the airplane passengers' comfort experiences. Having the ability to control this noisy environment with earplugs resulted in the lowest reported physical discomfort. © 2022 Hogrefe. All Rights Reserved.</abstract>"

2022,United States,Technology Adoption and Acceptance of Urban Air Mobility Systems: Identifying Public Perceptions and Integration Factors,"<title>Technology Adoption and Acceptance of Urban Air Mobility Systems: Identifying Public Perceptions and Integration Factors</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aims to identify expectations and perceptions of Passenger Air Vehicles (PAVs). Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background: The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method: A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results: Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board. Conclusion: PAV manufacturers, operators, and policymakers can utilize these findings to incorporate crucial design elements needed for PAVs to satisfy user expectations. These findings identify priorities that should be targeted in relative timeframes to satisfy near-term and long-term PAV users appropriately. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2022,United States,Investigating a Computational Explanation of the Black Hole Illusion,"<title>Investigating a Computational Explanation of the Black Hole Illusion</title> <abstract>Objective: We investigated the role of Perrone’s algorithm in the Black Hole Illusion (BHI). After analyzing the algorithm and identifying two of its predictions, we empirically tested them with two on-line experiments. Background: In 1983, Perrone proved that in daylight conditions it is possible to compute the descent angle using a ratio of retinal distances corresponding to the runway and surrounding context. Using the algorithm in nighttime conditions, with just the visible runway, pilots would overestimate the descent angle, leading to the BHI. Method: Mathematical analysis indicates the algorithm predicts a large BHI; perhaps too large if there are no mitigating factors. As Perrone noted, the BHI illusion magnitude should be affected by runway width; we also found that some conditions predict a reverse BHI (pilots should underestimate their descent angle). In our experiments, participants observed a cockpit view of a runway during five seconds of steady approach. In a subsequent still image, participants indicated where they believed the plane would land if it continued its flight path. We measured the accuracy of the landing positions for various runway widths and various background contexts. Results: The experiments did not show a BHI for any conditions; so the experiments do not validate the model predictions. Conclusion: Based on our analyses, Perrone’s algorithm does not provide an adequate explanation of the Black Hole Illusion. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2022,United States,Cognitive Biases in Risk Communication during Post-Flight Debrief,"<title>Cognitive Biases in Risk Communication during Post-Flight Debrief</title> <abstract>Objective: This paper aims to identify cognitive biases in risk communication among pilots during flight debrief. We evaluate the effect of framing language, representation format, and parameter type measured on how pilots interpret flight information. Background: Advancements in technology have created an opportunity for a data-centric approach to flight instruction. The understanding of virtual debrief formats, consisting of visualizations of flight data, relies on the pilot perceiving the information displayed accurately. Cognitive biases may impact how pilots perceive the information and therefore affect how they react to it in future flights. Method: We used flight data to design ways to communicate the information and developed a display prototype for the user. We asked pilots to evaluate eight different representations through a scenario-based survey. Pilots reviewed a flight and rated how risky they thought it was and the likelihood of their debrief resulting in any behavioral changes in upcoming flights. Results: Most significantly, the graphical representation format caused pilots to report a lower risk for the same flight, compared to the numerical representation format. Conclusion: The analysis of the survey has shown that debrief representation affects risk perception, but not necessarily willingness to change unsafe behaviors. Respondents were highly motivated to change unsafe behaviors, independent of how the information was presented to them. Future work should develop specific guidelines to be followed when designing debrief products. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2022,United Kingdom,Impact of COVID-19 on Job Satisfaction: The Case of Military and Airline Pilots,"<title>Impact of COVID-19 on Job Satisfaction: The Case of Military and Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the military and airline pilots’ Job Satisfaction (JS), and identify important contributory factors to support the development of future mitigating strategies. Background: The aviation industry has undergone a series of devastating changes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the implications of the pandemic on pilots’ JS are unknown. Methods: Quantitative JS measurements were taken from 203 European and Middle Eastern pilots, during the pandemic (March, 2021), using the shortened Job Descriptive Index and Job In General validated scales. Follow-up semi-structured interviews (April 2021) were conducted with 16 participants to establish pre-pandemic JS levels and identify the degree of change due to COVID-19. Results: Significant JS differences (p < .001) were observed between military and airline pilots; the former having higher levels. Qualitative findings revealed that airline pilots’ levels decreased due to factors such as job security, pay cuts, opportunities for promotion and skill-fade concerns. Military pilots experienced an increased JS, as state-funded organizations were not substantially affected by COVID-19, which led to a feeling of appreciation and thankfulness. Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to JS of military and airline pilots. Suggested mitigation measures for the civil aviation sector comprised effective communication between pilots and managers to reduce the pandemic-induced job uncertainty. Solutions such as extra flight simulator sorties were recommended to tackle the skill-fade effect. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: The perceptual-cognitive abilities required for MOT are also important for ATC performance. The current study provides a novel examination of NeuroTracker’s utility to predict novice performance on a simulated ATC task, relative to two discrete measures of working memory (WM). Method: Forty-six participants completed computer-based assessments of MOT ability (NeuroTracker) and WM (Corsi Block Tapping, Automated Operation Span) followed by the simulated ATC task. Regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between ATC task performance and the MOT and WM measures. Results: After controlling for age and video game playing, MOT ability significantly predicted more correct detections of conflicts between aircraft, fewer false alarm responses to conflicts, and faster aircraft acceptance and hand-off. When WM measures were included in regressions, MOT was a stronger predictor of performance than WM on those outcomes, and remained a statistically significant predictor of better conflict detection, false alarm response, and hand-off performance. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the relevance of MOT ability to ATC task performance and support the potential utility of NeuroTracker for controller applicant screening and selection. Research is required to validate the findings in larger and more representative samples under more realistic conditions. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: High levels of cognitive performance in pilots is required for flight safety. Methods: Students at a military flight school in Thailand were invited to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria was positive screening for caffeine use disorder. We examined three cognitive functions required for flight performance: (1) vigilance (Mackworth Clock Test), (2) situational awareness, including memory (Corsi block-tapping test) and spatial reasoning (mental rotation test), and (3) reaction time (Deary-Liewald task). Neuropsychological tasks were performed before and 30 minutes after drinking a bottle of 220 ml coffee containing 143 mg of caffeine. Sleep quality was measured by the Thai-Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Twenty-nine healthy males without caffeine use disorder with a mean age of 25.1 years were enrolled. After low-dose caffeine intake (<3 mg/kg body weight), cognitive performance improved significantly in vigilance, situation awareness, and reaction time. Baseline cognitive performance was not different between high (HSQ) and low sleep quality (LSQ) groups. After drinking coffee, however, participants with HSQ demonstrated improvements in vigilance and reaction time, while the LSQ group had improved vigilance only. Conclusion: Low dose caffeine improved vigilance, situational awareness, and reaction time which were cognitive functions required for flight performance. The cognitive-enhancing effect of caffeine was more obvious in student pilots with high-quality sleep. © 2022 Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.</abstract>"
2022,India,Investigation of Pilot Inceptor Workload and Workload Buildup Technique Through Simulator and In-Flight Studies,"<title>Investigation of Pilot Inceptor Workload and Workload Buildup Technique Through Simulator and In-Flight Studies</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigates the relationship of pilot inceptor workload (PIW) with the workload buildup flight test technique (WBFTT) with various conditions of pilot workload, for objective aircraft handling qualities (HQ) evaluation. Background: HQ evaluation of a piloted aircraft remains an elusive area of flight testing, due to the existing subjective evaluation technique for the pilot workload. The pilot control inceptor being an important interface for a pilot with the aircraft, it is the best tool to estimate pilot workload. Method: The statistical model of this research involved 3 independent variables, namely aircraft flying qualities, secondary task, and boundary effect of WBFTT, each differently affecting the pilot workload. Two studies were undertaken on a fixed-base, variable-stability HQ research flight simulator with military test pilots. In-flight study of pilot inceptor movement was undertaken in an advanced jet trainer aircraft during high pilot-gain air-to-ground target tracking tasks. Results: The results of simulator studies validated the relationships of PIW and WBFTT with statistical significance from a wide set of data, with variations in pilot workload in terms of flying qualities and secondary task. The in-flight studies validated the effects of high pilot gain and proximity to ground (boundary), on the pilot inceptor movements, in training combat maneuvers. Conclusion: Studies manifested PIW as a simple and direct measure to estimate pilot workload and WBFTT as an effective technique for HQ stress testing with high pilot gain. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2022,Turkey,Hybrid Human Error Assessment Approach for Critical Aircraft Maintenance Practice in the Training Aircraft,"<title>Hybrid Human Error Assessment Approach for Critical Aircraft Maintenance Practice in the Training Aircraft</title> <abstract>Objective: In this study, a hybrid human error assessment (HHEA) approach is proposed to determine the probability of aircraft maintenance technician (AMT) error occurring during aircraft repair. Background: The human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) is the first-generation empirical human reliability analysis (HRA) approach. Although this technique is used in several industries, AMTs’ errors have not been assessed with HEART and interactions of error-producing conditions (EPCs) have not been considered in calculating the probability of AMTs’ errors. Method: HHEA is proposed to reduce the subjectivity of experts’ judgments by calculating assessed proportion of affect of each EPC on human error probability (HEP) integrating HEART and the analytic network process (ANP) method. The proposed model has been applied in the maintenance of the elevator, which is one of the most important primary control surfaces for the Cessna 172 Series aircraft type. Results: The HEP values of 3 subtasks are found to be higher than the average HEP value. These subtasks have the highest probability of human error due to time pressure, poor environmental conditions, and being a repetitive task. Conclusion: This study could guide other aircraft maintenance organizations using this integration of human reliability assessment approach for critical maintenance practices to enhance flight safety and minimize human error. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Corrective feedback is primarily given verbally in flight training to facilitate trainee pilot performance. Such feedback can be provided using different vocal tones (i.e., positive, neutral, negative). How the effectiveness of the feedback varies based on changes in vocal tone remains unknown. Methods: Thirty-eight student pilots completed two simulated flights, both involving a right-hand circuit. Following the first flight, the student pilots listened to prerecorded verbal feedback in either a positive, neutral or negative tone about their flight performance, in terms of mean altitude during the downwind leg. Deviation from the target altitude during downwind in the second flight was examined. Self-efficacy and self-esteem were also measured to examine their mediating effect. Results: The results revealed that student pilots who received a positive tone of feedback performed significantly worse than pilots who received neutral or negative tones of feedback. No mediating effects were found for self-efficacy or self-esteem. Conclusion: These findings provide aviation authorities and training organizations insight into the effect of tone of feedback on trainee pilots’ performance.

Background: In recent years the proportion of male cabin crew has increased, still few studies have investigated gender differences in PSYJS and MSP in this occupational group. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire concerning work-related psychosocial demands, control, social support, and MSP was answered by 107 male and 329 female cabin crew members from the three major airline companies in Norway. Binary logistic regression models were used for the analysis. Results: There were no gender differences in PSYJS, but female cabin crew reported higher levels of social support from colleagues (p = .001) and nearest supervisor (p = .006). Multi-site MSP was reported by 70%. No gender differences in prevalence of single-site or multi-site MSP were found, except from a higher prevalence of pain in feet in female cabin crew (p = .020). Both a high strain (33%) and a passive (17%) work situation were associated with significantly higher risks of most single and multi-site MSP. Conclusion: Even though few gender differences were found, both male and female cabin crew reported high prevalence of MSP and high PSYJS. Attention should be given to create a healthier psychosocial work environment for this occupational group, with a special emphasis on support at work for male cabin crew. © 2021 The Author(s).

2022,Indonesia - United States,Why do Controllers Choose the Conflict Resolution Maneuvers that They Do?,"<title>Why do Controllers Choose the Conflict Resolution Maneuvers that They Do?</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to reveal the causal reasons for maneuver preferences on the basis of the objective measures. Background: Although the effects of conflict geometry have been well documented in previous literature, empirical evidence on the influence of conflict geometry on the operator’s workload, maneuver choice, and success is still lacking. Methods: hirteen undergraduate students with air traffic control (ATC) knowledge were requested to complete ATC tasks and resolve six different conflicts that were generated by manipulating two geometric features, namely, lateral (i.e., crossing, converging, and overtaking) and vertical (i.e., level and nonlevel) conflicts. Results: Crossing (p < .01) and converging (p = .05) conflicts resulted in higher workload than overtaking conflicts because of the higher geometric dimensions involved. Workload (p < .01) and performance (p < .03) were worse during nonlevel conflicts than during level conflicts. Notably, vertical maneuver led to a higher workload than other maneuver choices despite the higher preference for this maneuver. These findings were associated with visualization load. Conclusion: We failed to confirm that the resolution maneuver was chosen because of its good performance and low workload. Instead, predetermined rules (i.e., altitude, speed, and heading) were used, regardless of the workload, and the safety of the chosen maneuver for a particular conflict geometry was verified. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2022,Philippines,"Effect of Fatigue in Air Traffic Controllers’ Workload, Situation Awareness, and Control Strategy","<title>Effect of Fatigue in Air Traffic Controllers’ Workload, Situation Awareness, and Control Strategy</title> <abstract>Objective: To illustrate how fatigue affects the workload, situation awareness, and control strategy of air traffic controllers. Background: As air traffic control becomes more complex and demanding due to the increasing number of aircraft movements in major airport hubs, the need to particularly look into the interplay of performance shaping factors has also intensified. Despite the previous efforts of scholars to understand the framework of air traffic control based on factors on workload and situation awareness (SA) and its impact to shift in control strategy, the role of fatigue in such factors is ignored notwithstanding its relative impact on air traffic controllers as tasks are carried out in varying workload and work shift. Methods: A case study is conducted in an actual tower control center in the Philippines to demonstrate the hypothesized relations among fatigue, workload, SA, and control strategy. Questionnaires based on SPAM, SASHA, Samn-Perelli fatigue scale, and visual attention self-report are deployed to measure air traffic controllers’ fatigue levels, SA, and control strategy. Results: Fatigue has an inverse relationship with workload and has a significant effect on SA. Furthermore, fatigue is also found to have a significant relationship with some areas of interest including visual display terminal. Conclusion: Such results underpin the resource allocation decisions of stakeholders in the commercial aviation industry geared toward fostering the welfare of air traffic controllers. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,United States,An Examination of Pilot-Reported Trust and Response to Information Conflicts Experienced on the Flight Deck,"<title>An Examination of Pilot-Reported Trust and Response to Information Conflicts Experienced on the Flight Deck</title> <abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine how pilots respond to conflicting information on the flight deck. In this study, 108 airline, corporate, and general aviation pilots completed an online questionnaire reporting weather, traffic, and navigation information conflicts experienced on the flight deck, including which information sources they trusted and acted on. Results indicated that weather information conflicts are most commonly experienced, and typically between a certified source in the panel and an uncertified electronic flight bag application. Most participants (a) trusted certified systems due to their accuracy, reliability, recency, and knowledge about the source, and (2) acted on the certified system due to trust, being trained and required to use it, and its indicating a more hazardous situation. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2021,Australia,The Impact of a Legally Defined Just Culture on Voluntary Reporting of Safety Information,"<title>The Impact of a Legally Defined Just Culture on Voluntary Reporting of Safety Information</title> <abstract>The aim of the present study was to examine commercial pilots' reporting behavior and confidence in their airlines' just culture. In pursuit of this aim, 539 European-based pilots participated in the study by answering an online questionnaire. The results are compared with an earlier study comprising Australian-based pilots. The results reveal that 84% and 57% of the European and Australian pilots, respectively, trust their airlines' just culture. When comparing reporting behaviors, it was found that 53% of the Australian pilots and 33% of the European pilots stated they had failed to report, or had under-reported, safety information in their airlines' safety management system. A distinct difference with the aviation regulatory backdrop that the two pilot groups operate within is the legal legitimization of just culture in European law. It is unknown whether this difference influences confidence in just culture or has an effect on reporting behavior. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

2021,United States,Situational Awareness and General Aviation Accidents: An Analysis of 94 US Accident Reports,"<title>Situational Awareness and General Aviation Accidents: An Analysis of 94 US Accident Reports</title> <abstract>Situational awareness is a concept increasingly used in aircraft accident investigation reports. We analyzed 94 general aviation accidents in which situational awareness was mentioned by the National Transportation Safety Board investigator to determine factors that are significantly more often associated with fatality. We found a consistent use of the situational awareness concept, mainly applied to situations in which aircraft inadvertently collided with each other, with other man-made objects, and with various kinds of terrain. A significantly higher proportion of fatal accidents occurred during nighttime, in instrument meteorological conditions, or low visibility conditions. In addition, flights occurring during the cruise phase or in combination with spatial or geographical disorientation proved most often fatal. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2021,Germany,Why Commercial Pilots Voluntarily Report Self-Inflicted Incidents: A Qualitative Study with Aviation Safety Experts,"<title>Why Commercial Pilots Voluntarily Report Self-Inflicted Incidents: A Qualitative Study with Aviation Safety Experts</title> <abstract>Voluntary incident reports by commercial pilots provide essential data for airline efforts in learning from incidents (LFI). Because LFI is frequently limited by pilots not reporting incidents voluntarily, we interviewed seven commercial aviation safety experts in a focus group to derive factors influencing the voluntary reporting behavior of pilots' self-inflicted incidents. As a result, we derived 36 factors and integrated them into a motivational framework by van den Broeck et al. (2019). Pilots pursue various goals when voluntarily reporting incidents, such as enabling safetyrelated change or organizational learning. This behavior is influenced by personal antecedents, such as shame, and contextual antecedents, such as feedback. Our work expands the understanding of motivational aspects of voluntary incident reporting and discusses practical interrelations. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

This study aimed at identifying learning issues related to ab initio flight training and exploring the potential of augmented reality in tackling them. A survey was conducted with 43 pilots (31 men, 12 women) and seven flight instructors (six men, one woman). The results show the contents of the ab initio flight course that were most difficult to learn according to the pilots' and instructors' experience. In addition, the participants assessed the training conditions they experienced. After familiarization with typical use cases of augmented reality, the pilots and flight instructors indicated flight training elements that could benefit from augmented reality. The results are used to specify a research agenda for developing augmented reality applications for future ab initio pilot training. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2021,France,Display on Demand Method Increases Time Spent Looking Outside the Cockpit: Testing a Training Method during Visual Flight Rules Flights,"<title>Display on Demand Method Increases Time Spent Looking Outside the Cockpit: Testing a Training Method during Visual Flight Rules Flights</title> <abstract>Modern on-board instrumentation can lead to distraction, particularly by absorbing attention inside the cockpit, which reduces air safety. The display on demand (DoD) method tested here aims to impede that problem for glider and visual flight rules (VFR) pilots. In total, 21 students were assigned to either an experimental or a control group in a pre- and post-test design. In the experimental group, the cockpit instruments were displayed on the participants demand to allow for the orientation of visual attention out of the cockpit. Three types of basic exercises were tested. Skills acquisition was measured while evaluating the ability to follow flight indications given by the instructor such as airspeed, and visual attention was measured by an eye tracker. All participants improved their performance after training. Compared with classic training, the DoD method allows participants to spend more time looking outside the cockpit without any impact on the subjective workload. This is a promising method for ab initio flight training. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

Although prior studies established the importance of three specific cues, they failed to rank-order their importance. This exploratory paper presents two studies, with different methodologies, that examine the effect of these pictorial cues on depth perception. In both studies, participants experienced simulated scenarios and attempted to initiate the landing flare 10–20 ft above ground level. Study 1 included 121 and Study 2 included 141, naïve participants with no prior flight experience. Combined, the findings suggest that flight instructors, training literature, and airport architects should emphasize the runway above all other pictorial cues. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

Qualitative interviews with commercial airline pilots explored the relationship between work-related stress and well-being. Participatory workshops involving pilots were conducted. The methodology of this action-based research involved a blend of person-centered design approaches; specifically, stakeholder evaluation and participatory design. The findings further support the hypothesis that pilot well-being is being negatively affected by the nature of their work. The biopsychosocial model of the lived experience of a pilot, as presented in this paper, provides a useful structure to examine pilot well-being, and to identify and scope potential coping strategies to self-manage health and wellbeing issues associated with the job of being a pilot. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2021,Germany,Why Learning Opportunities from Aviation Incidents Are Lacking: the Impact of Active and Latent Failures and Confidential Reporting,"<title>Why Learning Opportunities from Aviation Incidents Are Lacking: the Impact of Active and Latent Failures and Confidential Reporting</title> <abstract>The rising trend of fatal aircraft accidents since 2018 suggests a limited safety capability of airlines in terms of learning from incidents (LFI). We evaluated 2,208 voluntary incident reports from commercial European pilots using qualitatively driven mixed methods to investigate LFI bottlenecks. The results showed that the report frequency depends on the type of pilots active failure causing the incident (performance-based errors, judgment and decision-making errors and violations). Learning opportunities were lacking, especially for incidents caused by pilots inadequate decision-making. Confidential reporting has positive effects on LFI, as these reports contained more information about latent failures. Furthermore, we identified several latent failures that are risk factors for certain unsafe acts. Our results may support airlines in various LFI activities. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2021,Malta - Turkey,Modeling of Aircrew Rostering Problem with Fatigue Risk Management Approach,"<title>Modeling of Aircrew Rostering Problem with Fatigue Risk Management Approach</title> <abstract>Objective: In this study, the aircrew rostering problem is evaluated in conjunction with fatigue factors. Background: In the mathematical models developed for crew rostering problems, the fatigue level of aircrew members is evaluated only within the scope of the flight and duty time limitations defined by the civil aviation authorities. In this study, a new model is developed in which the fatigue risk factors such as the number of flight legs, additional workload, circadian rhythm, and consecutive flights are added to the crew rostering problem. Method: A linear mathematical programming model was developed for the aircrew rostering problem. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used in the solution of the model. The problem is solved and the effects of the fatigue risk factors on crew rostering problems are examined by using the weekly and monthly real flight data of a Turkish air carrier. The results obtained are demonstrated in Gantt charts. Results: Although the results obtained are within the limits of flight and duty time defined by civil aviation authorities, it is found that many flight duties exceed the limits considering the fatigue risk factors. Conclusion: The model proposed can be used to minimize human error, predict the fatigue risk in various duties, and increase productivity and safety. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,United States,Pilots’ Willingness to Operate in Unmanned Aircraft System Integrated Airspace,"<title>Pilots’ Willingness to Operate in Unmanned Aircraft System Integrated Airspace</title> <abstract>Background: Considerable research is underway on how to integrate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) safely and securely into the National Airspace System (NAS). While there is some ongoing research on public acceptance, privacy concerns, and consumer willingness to fly in autonomous aircraft, little literature exists on pilots’ perceptions about operating to/from airports and in airspace with UAS integrated operations. Objective: The goal of this exploratory research study was to assess the effect of airspace classification, type of UAS integration, and type of UAS operation on pilots’ willingness to operate with UAS integrated operations. Method: Pilots’ attitudes about flying in UAS integrated airspace were collected using hypothetical scenarios in a factorial survey experiment and qualitative perspectives through open-ended and multiple-choice questions. Results: Results from the mixed analysis of variance indicated a significant two-way interaction between airspace classification and type of integration and a significant main effect for airspace. Differences were observed for all classes of airspace except Class B and Class C for segregated operations and Class D and Class E for integrated operations. Conclusion: The effect size for the two-way interaction was small, and overall airspace had a significant influence on willingness with the highest score for Class B operations and the lowest score for Class G operations. Results from the study are expected to support the development of better policies, procedures, and training methods. © 2021 The MITRE Corporation.</abstract>"
2021,United States,Cognitive Task Analysis of Unmanned Aircraft System Pilots,"<title>Cognitive Task Analysis of Unmanned Aircraft System Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) pilots must possess a variety of cognitive skills in order to successfully perform diverse missions. They must accurately assess situations, make judgments and decisions, understand cues that may not be immediately obvious, and develop effective solutions. How may we gain perspective on how UAS pilots make decisions when higher order cognitive skills are needed to solve problems and accomplish their missions? Background: Previous UAS task analyses, both behavioral and cognitive, have seldom examined experienced, high-hour UAS operators. It is important to know how these pilots address and solve problems to improve training and design. METHOD: The Applied Cognitive Task Analysis method (ACTA) was utilized to define and examine a sampling of the cognitive task requirements of operating a civilian UAS. The task analysis included sixteen UAS journeymen and expert pilots who had between 240 and 2000 + hours of experience. Tasks such as communication, search and rescue mission planning, coping with equipment malfunction, and developing situational awareness of their environment were analyzed. Result: The analysis produced six task diagrams, which identified key cognitive considerations, captured pilot insights after flying simulated missions, and documented examples where pilots used their expertise to solve operational problems. Conclusion: This ACTA method and resulting products may contribute to the design of new training courses/programs for novice UAS pilots. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Understanding pilot factors in weather-related diversions is integral to reducing the phenomenon of visual flight rules flight into meteorological conditions. Method: Thirty-six general aviation pilots flew a cross-country flight in a Cessna 172 simulator where they encountered an ATC-directed diversion due to deteriorating weather. Path analyses quantified effects in a two-stage model based on criteria specified by aviation regulations. Results: In stage 1, low cognitive flexibility and fewer recent pilot-in-command hours were associated with greater likelihood of ignoring the diversion instruction. Low cognitive flexibility was also associated with errors in locating the alternate aerodrome and incorrect procedures at the alternate. At stage 2, there were significant positive paths from a diversion efficiency variable to all aspects of pilotage. Pilotage positively predicted awareness of ownship and traffic, and was associated with fewer altitude violations. Conclusion: We provide empirical evidence for the association between the cognitive factors related to continuation bias and high-risk responses to diversion instructions. Using a two-stage model to conceptualize pilot performance illuminates the impact of cognitive factors in weather-related diversions. Highlighting the pivotal human factors at two clear junctions of an unexpected diversion can more fully prepare pilots to safely manage these risk-laden events. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: The Computerized Pilot Aptitude Screening System, more commonly known as COMPASS is a widely used selection test for ab-initio pilots. However, a literature search failed to uncover any research examining its predictive validity. Method: Thirty-five trainee pilots completed COMPASS, along with a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator to obtain an objective flight performance measure. Hours to flying milestones, including first solo and Recreational Pilot License, along with more subjective measures such as performance ratings by flying instructors were also compared to COMPASS. Twenty non-pilots also completed COMPASS. Results: The results revealed COMPASS to be effective in distinguishing between trainee pilots and non-pilots. However, there was no relationship between COMPASS scores and the various flight performance measures. Conclusion: These results should aid decision-makers when considering the viability of pilot selection tests, and reiterate the importance of using multiple methods/tools when attempting to select appropriate candidates for a specific role. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

While similar AR use and research in university education exists, this study piloted a comparative method assessing knowledge retention and transfer. Background: AR technology is a popular tool used in technical education. But learner behaviors observed like game play and exploration during this study could impact future learning strategy design as AR use increases. Method: 36 university undergraduate students enrolled in a university aeronautical engineering technology program were divided into AR and paper-based groups and compared on first-time task execution times for starting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing times for task completion was used. Results: Learner task times using AR were consistently faster, replicating similar AR studies, compared to learners using paper-based. However, AR test subjects also took longer interacting with the technology, including gaming-style “play” and exploration of the digital twin AR flight deck environment. This is believed to enhance learner innovation, knowledge retention and transfer, warranting further study. Conclusion: AR users had significantly reduced task execution times. Pre-task “gamification and play” were also observed among the AR users, which could impact how educators and the industry assess and leverage learning strategies when using AR for job task training. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: mindfulness-based training (MBT) have been used as a personal stress management tool in stressful working environments, including military aviation. There is little knowledge about the interpersonal mechanisms involved when engaging in MBT. Method: Adhering to Grounded Theory (GT), we conducted post-intervention interviews with 42 programme participants. We selected 30 interviews with evidence of interpersonal effects for in-depth analyses to build a theoretical model of the pathways through which interpersonal effects might develop. Results: The majority of the interviewees (30/42 = 71%) experienced significant interpersonal effects from MBT. The in-depth analyses revealed an increase in the common theme “Sense of Fellowship” (SOF). SOF comprised three primary change processes: “Attention to others,” “Self-observation” and “Reflection.” In addition, five behavioral changes emerged: “Direct communication,” “Increased patience,” “Decreased anger expression,” “Calmness,” and “Acceptance.” Finally, four contextual factors appeared to have particular importance for the development of SOF: “Plenary sessions,” “Sharing experiences,” “Doing something new together,” and “Sitting in silence.” Conclusion: These findings indicate that MBT has prosocial effects in a military aviation setting, and the constructed model contributes theoretically by suggesting how these psychosocial effects may arise and develop. © 2021 The Author(s).

Background: Fatigue is a pervasive safety hazard in aviation affecting several aspects of flight crew members’ ability to perform their job. Fatigue in aviation and its consequences has been researched across military and commercial operations, but until now Part 141 collegiate aviation pilots have been neglected. Method: Data were collected using an online survey questionnaire self-report questionnaire (N = 122) consisting of items investigating fatigue identification and management by Part 141 collegiate aviation pilots. Results: Sixty percent of the participants usually experience the mental and physical symptoms of fatigue during flight activities. A finding of concern was that 43% of the participants indicated they had not received any training in fatigue identification and management during ground and flight activities. Conclusion: The safety management of fatigue in a Part 141 collegiate aviation environment is a safety issue that warrants further research, and training and education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Currently, problems exist with a myriad of native language accents and phraseology interfering with cognitive reflexes especially for aircrews and air traffic controllers to safely do their work. Executives from four Brazilian airlines proactively implemented a 14-month LDP focused on English language fluency and leadership enhancements collectively for leaders within their firms. Method: Blended learning as proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization provided the experiential and heuristic framework of the LDP suitable for an empirical analysis of participants’ language and leadership improvements. Results: Research outcomes indicated Interaction Ritual Theory and Social Contagion Theory moderating entrained behaviors, emotions, and modes of LDP participants, upskilling their English language fluency and leadership competencies. LDP participants with no prior relationships progressed through the LDP wholly as a collective group prioritizing their language and leadership proficiencies. Conclusion: Optimization of English language fluency for aviation leaders can be accomplished in a lengthy customized leadership development program. Upskilling language proficiency for leaders assists them with transferring and motivating English language knowledge and fluency to their teams and organizationally. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,Australia - United Kingdom,Feedback and Student Learning: Matching Learning and Teaching Style to Improve Student Pilot Performance,"<title>Feedback and Student Learning: Matching Learning and Teaching Style to Improve Student Pilot Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: The present research investigated the relationship and the efficacy of two different modalities in which feedback is provided, namely “visual” and “auditory” on student pilot learning. Background: Pilot training has remained relatively unchanged for over thirty years. The syllabi for flight training contains little information about specific educational techniques or instructions that may assist the flight instructor in his/her role. Matching the learning style of the student, to that of the teaching style of the educator/instructor has the potential to improve learning outcomes. Method: Eighteen trainee pilots were divided into either visual or auditory learners based on the VARK learning styles model and asked to complete three test flights involving a left-hand circuit using a flight simulator. After each flight, pilots received feedback (control–no feedback, visual, auditory) about a different aspect of their flight performance (actual compared to target). Results: The results revealed when the modality in which the feedback was provided matched the preferred learning style of the pilot, improvements in performance resulted. When there was a mismatch between the two, adverse effects were evident for auditory learners only. Conclusion: From a theoretical perspective, the results provide clear evidence of the link between learning and teaching styles. From an applied perspective, these results highlight the potential benefits of aligning teaching and learning styles in flight training. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,China,Visual Improvements after Perceptual Learning Transfer from Normoxia to Hypoxia,"<title>Visual Improvements after Perceptual Learning Transfer from Normoxia to Hypoxia</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to evaluate vision improvement in hypoxia following normoxic perceptual learning. Background: Visual functions are important for flight safety. However, the potential of perceptual learning to compensate for hypoxic vision damage is unclear. Method: Seven observers enrolled in this study and were exposed to a hypoxic (11.5% O<inf>2</inf>) and a mesopic (3 cd/m2) environment. Visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity function (CSF) were evaluated in normoxia and hypoxia before and after the 8 daily training sessions. All observers trained in a monocular sine-wave grating detection task near their individual cutoff spatial frequencies while breathing normoxic gas. Results: The contrast sensitivity (CS) at the trained spatial frequency, the area under the log CSF (AULCSF) and VA decreased in a hypoxic environment. Additionally, all visual performances (i.e., CS, AULCSF and VA), regardless of whether they were measured in the normoxic or hypoxic condition, improved following normoxic perceptual learning. The degree of visual improvement did not differ between normoxia and hypoxia, indicating that visual improvement is completely transferable from normoxia to hypoxia. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that visual improvement remains even under environmental changes, and perceptual learning may be a noninvasive way to compensate for vision decreases in hypoxia. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Extant research exploring the effects of grading formats on evaluator performance focused on pen and paper modalities. This research investigated how a contemporary iPad-based grading format affected airline evaluator performance. Method: Forty-five evaluators from a major U.S. airline graded a Boeing 767 (Boeing is a wordmark of The Boeing Company, registered in the U.S. and other countries) flight crew experiencing an engine failure during takeoff. Three grading formats were used: pen and paper, a paper-based equivalent of the iPad grading format designed to replicate the function of the iPad, and the iPad. The effects of the grading formats were measured using the following dependent variables: recorded technical criteria, recorded non-technical criteria, and correlation and inter-rater agreement with a referent score. Results: Members of the iPad paper-based equivalent and iPad groups recorded significantly more technical and non-technical criteria compared to participants using pen and paper (p <.001). Members of the iPad paper-based equivalent and iPad groups had significantly higher correlation (p =.01) and inter-rater agreement levels (p <.01) compared to participants using pen and paper. Conclusion: The results of the study failed to support the iPad as a superior grading format. Research outcomes suggested structured grading may be a more important factor in predicting airline evaluator performance than the type of grading format used. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,Spain,Effects of Stress on Performance during Highly Demanding Tasks in Student Pilots,"<title>Effects of Stress on Performance during Highly Demanding Tasks in Student Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: To study how stress affects the performance of student pilots under highly demanding conditions, during flight simulator sessions. Background: Pilots usually suffer stress under highly demanding conditions. This can affect performance to such an extent that the human factor is the main cause of aviation accidents. Stress has not been studied recently in student pilots. Method: We used a wristband to record in real-time the Electrodermal Activity (EDA, a reliable indicator of stress) of student pilots during several flight simulator sessions. Experienced flight instructors graded their performance during these flights. The sessions were split into different tasks to focus only on performance and EDA in Highly Demanding Tasks (HDTs). Results: We found that students have higher EDA when correctly performing an HDT. Furthermore, we observed low EDA in students who perform well on the session as a whole but perform poorly on one particular HDT. Conclusion: The study indicates that high levels of stress are related to high performance at high levels of demand. We also observe that students (although they may perform well on the session as a whole) poorly performed a highly demanding task, during which they showed low levels of stress. We suggest that this could be due to fatigue, a lack of motivation, level of skills, or even overconfidence, all of which are variables that should be assessed in future work. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,Colombia - Spain,Aviation-Associated Spatial Disorientation and Incidence of Visual Illusions Survey in Military Pilots,"<title>Aviation-Associated Spatial Disorientation and Incidence of Visual Illusions Survey in Military Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: The lack of information on active military pilots has led to the present study, which aimed to analyze the sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation and the incidence of visual illusions of fighter and transport military pilots through a post-flight survey. Background: The advance of aeronautics has led to further aircraft developments, increasing heights and speeds which increase the psychophysiological demands, thus leading to greater incidence of spatial disorientation and visual illusions. Methods: 60 male pilots with large professional experience (1012 h ± 250 accumulated flying hours) between 7 and 18 years in their respective units and experience in international missions in the current conflict areas as Lebanon, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq, were subjected to a post-flight visual experience questionnaire. Results: Our findings suggest that transport pilots tend to present significant higher disorientation situations than fighter pilots, while fighter pilots presented greater sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation but experimented more visual illusions. Conclusion: These differences are related with the demands of the different aircrafts used by each pilot, thus specific, individualized and larger simulated training sessions in simulated environments are suggested. Further research should focus on the analysis of peripheral and central fatigue as constructs that may help to the appearance of greater spatial disorientation and visual illusions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2021,Canada,Investigating Offshore Helicopter Pilots’ Cognitive Load and Physiological Responses during Simulated In-Flight Emergencies,"<title>Investigating Offshore Helicopter Pilots’ Cognitive Load and Physiological Responses during Simulated In-Flight Emergencies</title> <abstract>Objectives: This study was designed to explore pilots’ emergency response performance by collecting real-time physiological and cognitive workload data during pre-defined offshore helicopter scenarios in a flight simulator. Background: Qualification processes require helicopter pilots to complete scheduled simulation training to ensure competency in areas that would otherwise be too dangerous to practice while flying the actual helicopter. Unfortunately, little is known about how effective this simulation training is in regard to cognitive and physiological responses. Methods: Ten qualified pilots completed six flight simulations while real-time eye tracking and physiological data were collected. The pilots were assigned to one of two groups based on their regular flying position (First Officer (FO) or Captain). Results: The findings indicated that there is a significant difference in maximal Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA<inf>max</inf>) and maximal heart rate (HR<inf>max</inf>) values between the two groups while completing the same in-flight emergency scenarios. Conclusions: Results suggest that FOs found the sessions more cognitively demanding and also indicated they would benefit from learning how Captains conduct their radial scan of instruments. Therefore, it is recommended that visual search patterns are included in initial training, all flight simulator training includes eye tracking, heart rate data are collected, and that future longitudinal research follows new pilots through their training/upgrading process. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,Assessing Person-Job Fit for Careers as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Sensor Operators,"<title>Assessing Person-Job Fit for Careers as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Sensor Operators</title> <abstract>Objective: Recent US Air Force occupational surveys indicated that while job satisfaction is high for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Sensor Operators (SO), a high percentage do want to reenlist. The objective was to assess factors that affect their job satisfaction and retention. The results will help guide development of Realistic Job Preview (RJP) videos for new recruits considering an RPA SO career. Background: Despite burgeoning demand and insufficient manning for RPAs to conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities, research on the factors that contribute to operator job satisfaction and retention has been limited. Method: One hundred ten RPA SOs were surveyed to assess factors thought to affect person-job fit. Thematic content analysis by independent raters was done to provide insight into factors that (1) may make the RPA career field a good or poor fit, (2) unique challenges and rewards of the career field, (3) misconceptions about the career field, and (4) job characteristics influencing retention decisions. Results: A high level of agreement (mean Cohen’s kappa = 0.73) occurred across pairs of raters. The strongest content themes indicated having a direct effect on the battlefield was rewarding (65.1%), adjusting to shift work was challenging (64.7%), and the job entailed a high level of responsibility (56.3%). Conclusion: Qualitative data may provide insight regarding factors affecting person-job fit and guide development of selection tools such as RJPs. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

2020,South Africa,Visual Analysis as a Predictor of Performance in Air Traffic Control Trainees,"<title>Visual Analysis as a Predictor of Performance in Air Traffic Control Trainees</title> <abstract>Objective: To examine visual analysis as a construct and to determine its contribution to performance during the training of ab initio trainee air traffic controllers. Background: Controllers are heavily reliant on visual information and visual analysis is an ability that could assist them in this role. If visual analysis is related to training results, the selection and training of people with good visual analysis abilities could reduce training expenses and time. Method: Three visual analysis instruments were administered to 54 pre-selected trainees during their first training course, and scores were compared with their training course results. Twenty-five qualified controllers also completed the visual analysis instruments for comparison with trainees. Results: The visual analysis instruments correlated with the course average and 13 of the 15 course subjects and predicted up to 23% of variance on course subjects. Trainees who passed all subjects at first attempt performed significantly better on two of the visual analysis instruments than those who failed at least one subject or withdrew from the course. Qualified controllers obtained better scores on two of the visual analysis instruments than trainees. Conclusion: Selection procedures could benefit from assessing visual analysis abilities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United Kingdom,Is It All about the Mission? Comparing Non-technical Skills across Offshore Transport and Search and Rescue Helicopter Pilots,"<title>Is It All about the Mission? Comparing Non-technical Skills across Offshore Transport and Search and Rescue Helicopter Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: The research objective of the current study was to examine and compare the non-technical skills utilized by search and rescue and offshore transport helicopter pilots. Background: Non-technical skills encompass the interpersonal and cognitive skills necessary for safe and efficient team performance in high-risk environments. There is a lack of research investigating non-technical skill use during helicopter flight or assessing differences in skills according to mission parameters. Method: The current study comprised 28 semi-structured qualitative interviews based upon the critical incident technique (16 offshore transport pilots, 12 search and rescue pilots). Interviews were thematically coded to identify, and compare, non-technical skills. Results: All key non-technical skills were reported across both pilot groups. Differences were identified at the element level of skills across the groups (e.g., while both groups reported utilizing situational awareness, elemental sub-components were based upon different attentional factors). A category for cognitive readiness was identified specific to search and rescue—this category encapsulated the elements necessary for a swift, effective response to emergencies. Conclusion: The results indicate helicopter pilots’ non-technical skills vary according to mission parameters, suggesting specific flight goals require different nuances of non-technical skills for mission achievement. We suggest that non-technical skills training should be tailored to the mission focus of helicopter pilots in order to further error mitigation strategies, enrich training relevance, and enhance effectiveness. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,Australia,Exploring the Association between Communication Satisfaction and Trust in the Aviation Maintenance Environment: An International Study,"<title>Exploring the Association between Communication Satisfaction and Trust in the Aviation Maintenance Environment: An International Study</title> <abstract>Objective: Is there any association detectable between communication and trust in the aviation maintenance sector? Background: Effective communication can have a positive contribution to safety in the aviation maintenance industry. In concert with trust, communication can also influence the detection of failures during the practice of maintenance in a civil and military aviation environment. Method: This study explores the association between three factors: communication satisfaction, interpersonal trust and trust toward aviation maintenance maintenance software. To this end, a survey was conducted to diverse set of aviation maintenance professionals. A quantitative analysis was performed on the data collected, to identify possible interrelations among the three factors examined. Results: For managers and subordinates, results showed that a substantial proportion of their communication satisfaction was explained by their levels of interpersonal trust. Differences in the communication satisfaction and software trust, between military and civil employees were also observed. The results of civil employees exhibit higher mean scores than that of military for all three factors. Overall, communication satisfaction was found to have a stronger association with interpersonal than with software trust. The mean scores of communication satisfaction and interpersonal trust increased across various levels of experience, with the differences between less and more experienced employees being statistically significant. Conclusion: This study identifies a positive association between communication and trust in aviation maintenance. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,"Work, Gender, and Sexual Harassment on the Frontlines of Commercial Travel: A Cross-Sectional Study of Flight Crew Well-Being","<title>Work, Gender, and Sexual Harassment on the Frontlines of Commercial Travel: A Cross-Sectional Study of Flight Crew Well-Being</title> <abstract>Background: The scale and scope of experience of sexual harassment at work among male and female flight attendants was examined. Flight attendants are a predominantly female workforce with an occupational heritage of female and male sexualized stereotypes. Method: Data represented perception and prevalence of sexual harassment related to hostile work environment among 8,700 North American (U.S. and Canada) and 1,887 United Kingdom (UK) flight attendants in the Flight Attendant Health Study. Results: Sexual harassment, mostly from passengers, pilots, and coworkers, was reported by 26% of North American flight attendants and 11% of UK flight attendants. Yet, 61% of UK flight attendants experienced unwanted sexual behaviors, pointing to possible underreporting of the sexual harassment problem. Sexually offensive behaviors received variable labeling as sexual harassment depending on gender of the victim and perpetrator profile. Conclusion: Sexual harassment is a potentially underreported workplace problem for flight attendants with underreporting resulting from gender-specific differences in individual perceptions. Understanding these differences is vital to addressing sexual harassment and the concomitant health risks. Traditional client and customer attitudes might lead to rose-colored victims’ judgment, especially in the case of customer service jobs involving emotional labor. Our results provide new information to guide future research regarding well-being of this understudied group of service employees. © 2020 The Author(s).

2020,Netherlands,The Effectiveness of a Mnemonic-Type Startle and Surprise Management Procedure for Pilots,"<title>The Effectiveness of a Mnemonic-Type Startle and Surprise Management Procedure for Pilots</title> <abstract>Background: Mnemonic-type startle and surprise procedures were previously proposed to help pilots cope with startle and surprise in-flight, but effects on performance after procedure execution have not yet been investigated. Objective: Thus, we tested the effectiveness a new mnemonic-type procedure in a moving-base simulator with a non-linear model of a small twin-propeller aircraft flown single-pilot. Method: An experimental group of twelve line pilots was trained to use a four-item procedure: 1. Calm down: take a deep breath, sit up straight and relax shoulders and hands. 2. Observe: call out the basic flight parameters. 3. Outline: formulate a hypothesis about the problem. 4. Lead: formulate and execute a plan of action. A control group of twelve line pilots received a control training. Next, all pilots performed four scenarios with startling and surprising events. Data were obtained on pilot performance, stress, procedure application and evaluation. Results: Application of the procedure in the test scenarios was high (90.0% full, 100.0% partly), and pilots evaluated the procedure positively (median: 4 on a 1–5 point scale). There was significantly superior decision-making in the experimental group, but immediate responses were significantly less optimal. Pilots sometimes applied the procedure at inappropriate moments. Conclusion: The results of the tested mnemonic-type procedure were promising. The procedure may benefit, however, from modifications to reduce complexity and to stimulate application at the appropriate moment. © 2020 The Author(s).

2020,Turkey,Framing Effect in Safety Risk Probability Assessment: A Prospect Theory Approach,"<title>Framing Effect in Safety Risk Probability Assessment: A Prospect Theory Approach</title> <abstract>Objective: To understand the relationship between the presentation of risk expressions in terms of loss/gain and safety personnel’s evaluation of risk probability in the context of prospect theory. Background: One of the major topics of behavioral economics is the issue of decision-making under uncertainty, and prospect theory is the most prominent theory in the field. This theory claims that individuals’ perceptions of losses are more severe than their perceptions of gains, and thus, the utility–value function is not symmetrical. Method: Two studies (N = 39 and N = 49) were performed in which business aviation safety professionals were asked to assess several risk expressions. In each study, subjects were divided into two groups. One group assessed unframed risk events, while the other assessed positively framed ones. Average probability values of each group were compared to each other, in order to understand whether framing caused a shift in risk assessment. Results: Positively framing the risk expressions caused risk assessors to focus on threats instead of existing measures and to show “risk aversion” for two out of five risks–notably, the two related to human factors. Conclusion: These results show that prospect theory predictions regarding decision-making under uncertainty may not be limited to financial decisions and can be extended to safety risk assessment. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,Adversity in Aviation: Understanding Resilience in the Workplace for Female Pilots,"<title>Adversity in Aviation: Understanding Resilience in the Workplace for Female Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: This study measured the resilience of female pilots using the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Background: Adversity in the workplace causes occupational stress, influencing resiliency, and reducing job performance and wellness. This can lead to burnout and attrition. Female pilots in male-dominated work environments experience adversity, resulting in occupational stress. Resilience may be a mitigating factor for coping with occupational stress. Women in male-dominated professions remain the extreme minority. Further, a severe pilot shortage magnifies the need to recruit and retain pilots from underrepresented groups. Method: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to validate the use of the CD-RISC for measuring resilience in female pilots. Inter- and intra-group resilience score comparisons of the 1,302 female pilots were analyzed. Results: An abridged version of the CD-RISC was found applicable to measuring resilience in female pilots. Age and work experience of the female pilots imply that they may influence higher resilience. A significantly lower resilience score was found in the sample in comparison to a national sample average resilience score. Conclusion: Female pilots’ resilience is likely influenced by workplace adversity, which may lead to increased occupation stress, greater attrition, and fewer pilot entrants. Interventions aimed at increasing the resiliency of female pilots are critical to solving the pilot shortage. The findings provide insight into the recruitment, retention, and development of women in male-dominated occupations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,Predictive Validity of the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) for Pilot Performance: A Meta-Analytic Investigation at the Subtest Level,"<title>Predictive Validity of the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) for Pilot Performance: A Meta-Analytic Investigation at the Subtest Level</title> <abstract>The Air Force Qualifying Test (AFOQT) has been the primary selection test battery for officer candidates in the US Air Force since 1953. Despite a wealth of literature on the validity of the AFOQT in predicting pilot performance, there is less evidence on its validity generalization. This study investigated the predictive validity of 16 AFOQT subtests and its Pilot composite via psychometric meta-analytic procedures. Based on 32 independent samples from 26 studies, results indicated that pilot performance is best predicted by subtests indicative of perceptual speed, aviation-related aptitude and knowledge, and quantitative ability constructs, and least predicted by subtests indicative of verbal ability construct. Evidence for validity generalization of AFOQT subtests is presented, and implications for practical use are discussed. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

GA is a high-risk area of aviation with many GA accidents considered to be the result of pilot performance rather than mechanical failure. Pilots (n = 101) were presented with 12 go/no-go take-off decision scenarios across four risk categories (compromised performance, environment, faulty equipment, missing equipment). Scenarios depicting a missing checklist, missing sunglasses, and stress were considered less risky than illness, a faulty airspeed indicator (ASI), and a broken seatbelt. Pilots weighed their take-off decisions against mitigating factors, protective measures, and flight parameters. Situation awareness training and a focus on pre-flight planning may help to enhance flight safety within this group. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2020,United States,An Alternative Method for Identifying a Failed Engine in Twin-Engine Propeller Aircraft,"<title>An Alternative Method for Identifying a Failed Engine in Twin-Engine Propeller Aircraft</title> <abstract>Twin-engine propeller aircraft accidents occur due to mechanical reasons as well as human error, such as misidentifying a failed engine. This paper proposes a visual indicator as an alternative method to the dead leg-dead engine procedure to identify a failed engine. In total, 50 pilots without a multi-engine rating were randomly assigned to a traditional (dead leg'dead engine) or an alternative (visual indicator) group. Participants performed three takeoffs in a flight simulator with a simulated engine failure after rotation. Participants in the alternative group identified the failed engine faster than the traditional group. A visual indicator may improve pilot accuracy and performance during engine-out emergencies and is recommended as a possible alternative for twin-engine propeller aircraft. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2020,Sweden,Effects of Fatigue on Cognitive Performance in Long-Duration Simulated Flight Missions,"<title>Effects of Fatigue on Cognitive Performance in Long-Duration Simulated Flight Missions</title> <abstract>Fighter pilots may be exposed to extended flight missions. Consequently, there is increasing concern about fatigue. We investigated the effects of fatigue and cognitive performance in a simulated 11-hr mission in the 39 Gripen fighter aircraft. Five cognitive tasks were used to assess cognitive performance. Fatigue was measured with the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Index. Results showed that performance in the nonexecutive task degraded after approximately 7 hr. Fatigue ratings showed a matching trend to the performance in this task. Performance in tasks taxing executive functions did not decline. We interpreted that fatigue can be overridden by increased attentional effort for executive tasks but not for non-executive components of cognition. Participants underestimated their performance and metacognitive accuracy was not influenced by fatigue. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"

2020,United States,Fatigue in Aeromedicine: A Validity Study of the Flight Risk Assessment,"<title>Fatigue in Aeromedicine: A Validity Study of the Flight Risk Assessment</title> <abstract>Objective: A validation study was conducted on the Flight Risk Assessment (FRA), a unique self-report fatigue measure for flight medics on duty. Background: Air medical professionals face unique challenges above and beyond the difficulty of working in a hospital setting or prehospital ground medicine. Providers frequently work multiple 24-hour shifts, resulting in circadian rhythm disturbance and cumulative sleep loss. The plane environment and the effects of flight are also contributory to fatigue; however, air medics must engage in emergent, time-sensitive, life-saving procedures despite these challenging circumstances. Although the aeromedical industry has rapidly expanded in the past several decades, the field of flight medicine lacks validated tools to evaluate fatigue levels, and many companies rely on flight providers’ recognition of fatigue to prevent work-related mistakes. Method: To establish construct validity, scores on the FRA were compared to scores on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), an objective measure of fatigue. Results: The results indicate that a total of five questions on the FRA was significantly and strongly correlated with mean reaction time on the PVT (r =.60, p =.001). Perceived fitness for duty was poorly correlated with fatigue levels as measured by the FRA (r <.01) suggesting medics may have difficulty recognizing when they are fatigued and fit for duty. Conclusion: The air medical industry is rapidly expanding, and valid and reliable measures are indicated to assess fatigue levels among providers. Initial findings suggest the FRA is an efficient tool to objectively measure the fatigue levels of air medics through a self-report measure. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,Israel,Does Specific Flight Experience Matter? The Relations Between Flight Experience of Commercial Aviation Aircrews and Missed Approach Incidents,"<title>Does Specific Flight Experience Matter? The Relations Between Flight Experience of Commercial Aviation Aircrews and Missed Approach Incidents</title> <abstract>Objectives: This study examined the relations between flight experience of commercial aviation aircrews consisted of a captain (CAP) and a first officer (FO) and their relative representation in unsafe missed approach incidents. Background: This study follows an earlier study where 59 official safety reports of unsafe missed approach procedure (MAP) events were analyzed. Method: The current study utilized these reports to explore the relations between the aircrew’s specific flight experience (SFE) on the aircraft’s type rating that was involved in the incident and the aircrews’ performance during MAP safety incident. Results: There were significantly more incidents involving CAPs with intermediate level of SFE than incidents involving CAPs with high or low SFE. Furthermore, the interrelation between the SFEs of the CAP and the FO of the same aircrew showed that the number of incidents involving FOs with low SFE was significantly higher than that involving FOs with higher SFE. Furthermore, there were significantly more MAP events when the FO took the role of pilot monitoring compared to pilot flying. Discussion: It is suggested that CAPs with an intermediate SFE might feel that they have sufficient skills to operate the airplane, but in fact, they are not yet skilled enough. We further discuss the possibility that issues of authority and hierarchy inside the cockpit play a role and affect the aircrew’s performance. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,A Comparative Evaluation of Hypotheses to Explain the Black Hole Illusion,"<title>A Comparative Evaluation of Hypotheses to Explain the Black Hole Illusion</title> <abstract>Objective: This study comparatively evaluated seven hypotheses to explain the Black Hole Illusion. Background: Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Black Hole Illusion (BHI), with differing predictions. The Constant Visual Angle hypothesis predicts that short runways should cause greater BHI. Meanwhile, several other hypotheses predict that longer runways should cause more severe BHI. In addition, there is debate whether lack of ground cues promotes BHI via autokinesis or by biasing pilots’ perception of the runway. Method: Nineteen qualified pilots flew 27 simulated nighttime approaches in a fixed-base flight simulator. Participants flew under different combinations of runway length, starting distance from the runway, and starting altitude. We analyzed glideslope error, defined as a weighted sum of the error above or below a prescribed 3° glideslope, as well as RMSE around the approach path. Results: We found that pilots tended to demonstrate worse BHI effects during approaches to longer runways and when starting at low altitudes compared to high altitudes. Daylight and nighttime flights showed a similar variance around the glideslope. Conclusion: The constant visual angle hypothesis is not supported by our findings. We observed consistent glideslopes across starting locations and similar variance during day/night conditions, leading us to favor biased perception of the runway over autokinetic effects to explain the influence of contextual features on BHI. ©, The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Navy, Department of Defense, nor the U.S. Government.

2020,Poland,Susceptibility to Flight Simulator-Induced Spatial Disorientation in Pilots and Non-Pilots,"<title>Susceptibility to Flight Simulator-Induced Spatial Disorientation in Pilots and Non-Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether pilots and non-pilots differ in their susceptibility to spatial disorientation (SD) during a flight in various disorienting scenarios, and in coping with SD. Background: Pilot selection is relevant in assessing pilots’ susceptibility to SD. However, SD-related accidents indicate that it may not be fully effective. Method: A set of 12 flight sequences (six containing an SD conflict, three with vestibular and three with visual illusions) was flown by military pilots (N = 20; age: M = 31.6; SD = 8.22) and non-pilots (N = 20; age: M = 30.95; SD = 7.72) in a flight simulator specially designed for SD research and training. The number and mean magnitude of control reversal errors (CREs) were calculated along with the effects of SD conflict on flight performance. Results: With two exceptions, in all SD-conflict flights, the mean number of CREs increased. For mean magnitudes of CREs, the same effects were not observed. Pilots and non-pilots differed in disorientation conditions (M = 4.5 ± 1.95 vs M = 2.6 ± 2.41) only in one profile (shape constancy illusion). In the other two (false horizon and leans illusions), the applied SD cues significantly affected their flight performance. Conclusion: Although the effects of SD cues on flight performance were observed, the applied disorientation scenario would not be useful in the pilot selection procedure. To provide the criteria to select pilot candidates, other disorientation scenarios, or even a different flight simulator should be considered. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2020,United States,Preliminary Support for the Line Bias Illusion as a Contributor to Black Hole Effects,"<title>Preliminary Support for the Line Bias Illusion as a Contributor to Black Hole Effects</title> <abstract>Objective: We tested the plausibility of the hypothesized Line Bias Illusion to explain a spatial disorientation phenomenon known as the Black Hole Illusion (BHI): in the absence of a visible horizon, pilots misjudge an implicit horizon from the convergence point of parallel runway edge lines. Background: BHI occurs when impoverished visual conditions at night cause pilots to fly too low on landing approaches. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain BHI, without clear consensus in the literature. Method: We conducted multiple experiments in which participants judged the intersection point of dotted lines on a computer screen. In Experiment 1, participants placed a horizon line where they believed two converging dotted line segments should intersect. In Experiments 2A and 2B, participants estimated the intersection point of single dotted line segments with a separate solid line. Results: Participants in Experiment 1 tended to place the intersection point of two converging lines too low on the computer screen. Participants in Experiments 2A and 2B tended to respond as if the stimulus lines were more horizontal than actually presented. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pilots misjudge the location of an implicit horizon based on the runway edge lines. In the context of a visual spatial strategy that assumes a stable horizon, such a misperception may cause pilots to adopt a low flight path. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,Canada - United States,Multisensory Cues for Encoding Urgency of System Hazards: Effect of Operator Experience on Perceived Urgency,"<title>Multisensory Cues for Encoding Urgency of System Hazards: Effect of Operator Experience on Perceived Urgency</title> <abstract>Objective: This study evaluated sonification and tactification for encoding urgency of system health status presented in the ground control station (GCS) visual interface of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and the observer’s perception of urgency. Background: The barrage of data in the GCS visual interface has the potential to isolate the operator from detecting system hazards that threatens the ability of the operator to operate the UAS effectively. Method: The pitch of the UAS’s engine revolutions per minute was mapped to a sonification, and excessive attitude upset of the UAS was mapped to a tactification in order to present a continuous awareness of the system’s health without being invasive and obtrusive. Participants with and without flying experience were required to monitor system health, while carrying out a secondary task. Results: Regardless of flying experience, sonification enhanced hazard detection compared to a visual-only GCS interface, but tactification did not aid performance. Conclusion: While multimodal displays have been studied in remotely piloted vehicles, this is the initial effort to demonstrate that sonification can influence perceived urgency leading to greater warning compliance. Further research is warranted to develop guidelines to ensure that non-visual signals can convey different levels of urgency for a continuous awareness of a system’s health, and thereby permit the operator to establish the appropriate level of priority to address the alarmed condition. © 2019, © 2019 Crown Copyright.</abstract>"
2019,China - United States,Timestamp Representative of Weather Radar Images in the Cockpit,"<title>Timestamp Representative of Weather Radar Images in the Cockpit</title> <abstract>Objective: The experiment reported here evaluated what a type of timestamp is an easy way for pilots to perceive and quickly assess the length of delay in NEXRAD mosaic radar images. Background: Data-linked mosaic NEXRAD images can be more than 14 min delayed by the time they reach the cockpit for use by pilots. The NTSB issued a safety alert to warn that the NEXRAD “age indicator” can be misleading. Unfortunately, research has indicated that pilots may not be fully aware of the delay and that it can adversely affect their decision-making and performance. Method: The three types of timestamps were “direct age”, “clock”, and “UTC” with three levels of time delay (short, medium, and long). Twenty-one participants read and compared two radar images, via timestamps, to determine the length of delay and which one was more recent. Results: The results indicated that the type of timestamp and the length of time delay significantly affected participants’ response time and accuracy. “UTC” timestamp with a long-time delay was associated with the longest response time and low accuracy. The “direct age” timestamp led to the highest accuracy and shortest response time for all manipulated levels of time delay. Conclusion: Although “UTC” format is commonly used in many weather products, we found the “direct age” format to be the superior method to support perceptions of time delay. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,Turkey,Structuring Risk Assessment Process with Tallying in Aviation Safety Management,"<title>Structuring Risk Assessment Process with Tallying in Aviation Safety Management</title> <abstract>One of the bounded rationality approaches is fast-and-frugal heuristics framework which is demarcating between risk and uncertainty concepts. The risk approach of the ICAO Safety Management System is completely based on the “risk” concept only and it recommends a risk assessment method not considering that some events can be described as uncertainty rather than risk because of insufficient data. Uncertainty conditions are complex and not-calculable events so the risk evaluation process may be error-prone due to the subjectivity of experts. This paper suggests using “tallying checklists” which are based on unit weight additive linear model, for making the probability and severity value assignments more consistent. Moreover, two checklists were created for a business jet operator and the twenty recent risk assessments of the operator were re-evaluated by using these checklists. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,New Zealand,Perceived Workload Is Associated with Cabin Crew Fatigue on Ultra-Long Range Flights,"<title>Perceived Workload Is Associated with Cabin Crew Fatigue on Ultra-Long Range Flights</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aimed to determine whether on ultra-long range (ULR) flights, perceived workload is an independent predictor of cabin crew fatigue at top-of-descent (TOD) and if so, to what degree it is associated with cabin crew fatigue relative to sleep-related factors. Background: Current ULR scheduling for cabin crew is predominantly based on flight crew data. However, cabin crew workload is very different in nature to that of flight crew. Method: Fifty-five cabin crew wore an actigraph and completed a sleep/duty diary to monitor sleep during a ULR trip. At TOD, crewmembers completed a 5-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), rated their sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and fatigue (Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check), and after landing their workload (NASA Task Load Index). Results: When workload was perceived as higher, crewmembers felt more sleepy and fatigued and had more PVT lapses at TOD. The effect of workload on sleepiness was larger (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.27) than the duration of wakefulness (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.14), but the effect of workload on fatigue (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.17) was smaller than the duration of wakefulness (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.24). Lapses were not associated with sleep history, whereas workload had a small effect (Cohen’s ƒ2 =.14). Conclusion: Workload as a fatigue factor for cabin crew warrants ongoing monitoring. This can be achieved by including a workload question in fatigue reports as an essential component in Fatigue Risk Management Systems. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,United States,Laser Eye Protection and Color Recognition and Discrimination in Aviation,"<title>Laser Eye Protection and Color Recognition and Discrimination in Aviation</title> <abstract>The number of reported laser strikes on aircraft has increased over the years. Laser strikes pose a threat to safety and pilot health. Laser eye protection (LEP) is one mitigation method available to pilots; however, LEP can affect a person's color vision. This exploratory study investigated the effect of LEP on color recognition and discrimination of four colors - red, blue, green, and amber - using a sample of 90 participants. When using the LEP, most participants were still able to identify the correct color, but color discrimination between different shades of the same color proved to be less accurate. Of the investigated colors, results suggested that color recognition of amber was the most affected by LEP. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2019,South Africa - United Kingdom,The Role of Peer Support and Its Contribution as an Effective Response to Addressing the Emotional Well-Being of Pilots: A Qualitative Study of South African Stakeholders,"<title>The Role of Peer Support and Its Contribution as an Effective Response to Addressing the Emotional Well-Being of Pilots: A Qualitative Study of South African Stakeholders</title> <abstract>The provision of pilot peer support in commercial aviation is a recent recommendation following the Germanwings pilot suicide?murder crash in 2015. Conducted in a South African aviation context, this study explored the phenomenon of peer support and its role and contribution as an effective response to addressing the emotional well-being of pilots. A qualitative phenomenological research design was followed using Rubin and Rubin?s in-depth, semi-structured interview technique to understand lived experiences of peer support. Nine interviews were held, six with airline pilots - a combination of peers and flight operations managers - and three with mental health professionals (MHPs). Braun and Clarke?s thematic analysis (TA) method elicited themes in relation to peer support and the mental health and well-being of pilots. Four themes emerged relating to (a) the conceptualization of peer support, the role of the peer, and the principles on which the process is founded; (b) pilots? experience of their workplace as emotionally ""unsafe"" and deficient in acknowledging the nature of different emotional stressors; (c) the well-being of pilots and medical certification of fitness for duty; and (d) the multidimensional contribution of peer support and factors critical to integrating successful and sustainable peer support. This study underscores the importance of developing a more integrated definition of safety in aviation that incorporates supporting the mental health and well-being of pilots. This paper addresses the role and contribution of peer support and considers some of the challenges to its integration as a safety initiative. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2019,Germany,Attitude Indicator Format: How Difficult Is the Transition between Different Reference Systems?,"<title>Attitude Indicator Format: How Difficult Is the Transition between Different Reference Systems?</title> <abstract>A simulator study investigated the consequences of a transition between two alternative formats of the attitude indictor in aircraft cockpits, the moving-horizon and moving-aircraft format. Two groups of novices practiced performing two flight tasks (flight-path tracking and recovery from unusual attitudes) with one attitude-indicator format for six practice sessions, before transitioning to the other format. The results show that, after practice, participants were able to perform both tasks equally well with both attitude-indicator formats. However, the number of reversal errors in the recovery task increased considerably when transitioning from the moving-aircraft to moving-horizon format. No such effect emerged for the other direction. This suggests that the former transition is more difficult and represents a possible risk for flight safety. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2019,United Arab Emirates - United Kingdom,Passenger Attitudes to Flying on a Single-Pilot Commercial Aircraft,"<title>Passenger Attitudes to Flying on a Single-Pilot Commercial Aircraft</title> <abstract>There is little specific research on people's opinions of single-pilot commercial airline operation and whether they are willing to fly by this means. This study examines passengers? attitudes to help determine their willingness to fly on an aircraft of this type. Part 1 involved four focus groups providing their views on the matter. In Part 2, an online survey was developed from the output of the focus groups that gathered passenger perceptions of single-pilot operations. The feedback from the focus groups highlighted distrust in technology, concerns about pilot health and workload, and the need for more information on single-pilot operations but also that if there were substantial savings passengers may be willing to fly on such an aircraft. The results of the survey suggested three main dimensions to passenger opinion on the subject: state of the pilot; trust in the technology; ticket price and reputation. Responses on these scales could determine with some certainty passengers? willingness to fly or not to fly on a single-pilot airliner. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2019,Australia,An Investigation into the Factors that Affect Miscommunication between Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers in Commercial Aviation,"<title>An Investigation into the Factors that Affect Miscommunication between Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers in Commercial Aviation</title> <abstract>Objective: The present research sought to investigate the communication performance of both native English sounding pilots and accented commercial pilots in two different phases of flight, the approach and departure phase of flight. Background: English language proficiency requirements, standardized phraseology, and readbacks are some of the proactive measures which the aviation industry employs to ensure effective communication. However, despite these efforts, errors in communication still occur, and anecdotal evidence suggests that factors such as language background and phase of flight increase the likelihood of communication errors. Method: Eighteen hours of air-ground communications at Kingsford Smith International Airport, Sydney, Australia, were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that accented pilots committed more communication errors than native English sounding pilots and more specifically that these errors were mistakes rather than omissions, and involved words rather than numbers. Communication performance was similar in the approach and departure phases of flight regardless of language background. Conclusion: These results provide detailed information about the type of communication errors which occur in commercial aviation, their prevalence and the context in which they occur, which helps guide where resources should be directed to further improve safety. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,China,An Evaluation Model Based on the Fuzzy AHP for Teleoperation Performance,"<title>An Evaluation Model Based on the Fuzzy AHP for Teleoperation Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: This study is to construct a model composed of multiple indices to measure astronaut teleoperation performance. Background: Teleoperation is a key operation during spaceflight. Comprehensive scientific evaluation techniques for teleoperation performance are important for astronaut selection and training. Method: Four categories of indices, i.e., completion performance, safety performance, subjective cognitive performance and physiological parameters, were adopted in this model. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to compute the weight coefficients of the indices to construct the linear performance model. Sixty-four male subjects were recruited to complete three teleoperation tasks, including point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance, in simulated environments. Their performance was rated by the researchers after the tasks. Results: The safety performance index had the highest weight coefficient (0.5274) of the first level indices, and the weight coefficient of the collisions index (0.8227) was the highest of the second level indices for safety performance. The linear performance model was constructed to calculate comprehensive performance values. Conclusion: Safety considerations are the most important factors for astronauts to consider in teleoperation. The collision of the robotic arm is the most vital safety index. The comprehensive value derived from the model was significantly related to overall performance. The validity of our model was verified, and it is anticipated that the model will be used to evaluate the performance of remote robotic arm operations. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,"Taiwan, Province of China",Design Factors of Guiding Aircraft Through Continuous Descent Operations: Pilot and Controller Perspectives,"<title>Design Factors of Guiding Aircraft Through Continuous Descent Operations: Pilot and Controller Perspectives</title> <abstract>Objective: This survey identifies the design factors needed to guide aircraft through continuous descent operation (CDO) procedures. Background: Three possible alternatives for CDO at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) in Taiwan are presented: (a) open path-radar vectoring-based CDO, (b) open path-time control-based CDO, and (c) open path procedure permitting CDO to downwind. Method: One hundred and twenty surveys were distributed and 61 pilots and 49 controllers responded. Eight pilots and 25 controllers had experience implementing CDOs. Results: All respondents ranked altitude control as the most important design factor. Pilots with CDO experience preferred to reduce the frequency of communication in the procedure, whereas experienced controllers expected to know the approach path as early as possible. Conclusion: Altitude control is the highest priority design factor for improving the current CDO procedure at TPE. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,United Kingdom,How Do General Aviation Pilots Choose Their Route When Flying in Complex Airspace?,"<title>How Do General Aviation Pilots Choose Their Route When Flying in Complex Airspace?</title> <abstract>Objective: This study is an analysis of the planning of general aviation (GA) pilots and its impact on airspace infringements. Background: Past studies identified the contribution of inadequate flight planning to airspace infringements in Europe, but without any discussion relating to the processes involved and their shortcomings. This article, therefore, examines the flight route decision making of GA pilots. Method: Twenty-seven recreational GA pilots who flew an airplane, glider, or ultralight aircraft were interviewed using semistructured interviews in Finland, Norway, and the United Kingdom. These nations experienced a relatively high number of reported airspace infringements. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The results showed that GA pilots planned a route near controlled or restricted airspace especially in areas with small uncontrolled airspace. This decision was typical for GA pilots who were based in the capitals of the European nations. The selected flight path and altitude were influenced by factors related to the pilot (e.g., risk management) and the airspace design (e.g., low lower boundary of controlled airspace). Pilots who were aware of the risk of straying into airspace while flying such a route considered mitigation measures, such as cross-checking the aircraft’s position frequently. Conclusion: Such findings can address airspace infringements by encouraging pilots to take mitigation actions while flying such a route, including flying at a greater distance from the airspace. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2019,Canada - Slovakia - United Kingdom,Assessing Locus of Control in Pilots: Psychometric Evaluation of a Self-Report Measure,"<title>Assessing Locus of Control in Pilots: Psychometric Evaluation of a Self-Report Measure</title> <abstract>The present study systematically assessed the factor structure, internal consistency, and construct validity of the Aviation Safety Locus of Control scale (ASLOC) on 476 European pilots (4.6% female). Independent confirmatory factor analyses showed a strong correlation between the latent factors of Internal and External LOC, justifying proceeding with a one-factor solution (assessing internal LOC after reversescoring items). This model achieved adequate fit with excellent internal consistency, after refining with structural equation modeling. Furthermore, flight hours significantly predicted Internal LOC after controlling for age, suggesting that pilots' work experience can enhance internal attributions of control. This has implications for safety-related behaviors and protection against accidents. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2019,Germany - Ireland,Workload Perception of Air Traffic Control Officers and Pilots during Continuous Descent Operations Approach Procedures,"<title>Workload Perception of Air Traffic Control Officers and Pilots during Continuous Descent Operations Approach Procedures</title> <abstract>The paper examines the workload perceived by air traffic control officers (ATCOs) and pilots during continuous descent operations (CDOs), applying closed- and open-path procedures. CDOs reduce fuel consumption and noise emissions. Therefore, they are supported by airports as well as airlines. However, their use often depends on pilots asking for CDOs and controllers giving approval and directions. An adapted NASA Total Load Index (TLX) was used to measure the workload perception of ATCOs and pilots when applying CDOs at selected European airports. The main finding is that ATCOs' workload increased when giving both closed- and open-path CDOs, which may have a negative impact on their willingness to apply CDOs. The main problem reported by pilots was insufficient distance-to-go information provided by ATCOs. The workload change is important when considering the use of CDOs. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2019,United Kingdom,The Impact of Work on Pilots' Personal Relationships: A Qualitative Study,<title>The Impact of Work on Pilots' Personal Relationships: A Qualitative Study</title> <abstract>This study investigates how pilots perceive the way in which their work and shift patterns may impact upon their personal relationships. It also examines the way in which pilots cope with frequently having to form and then put on hold relationships both at home and at work. Three hundred pilots were surveyed by questionnaire to examine the impact of working in the airline industry on personal relationships. Participants were recruited over a 4-year period between 2012 and 2016 on a university's Master's program in Air Transport Management. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis (TA). The study found that that partner support was key in managing the demands of shift work and that having an understanding partner was the key to the relationship working. This study is representative of a single sample of mostly male pilots flying for more than 2 years. Future research may seek to use a more diverse sample. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>
2019,United States,Design of a Primary Flight Display to Avoid Decelerating below the Minimum Safe Operating Speed,"<title>Design of a Primary Flight Display to Avoid Decelerating below the Minimum Safe Operating Speed</title> <abstract>Analysis of recent airliner accidents and incidents identified a class of events in which structurally, mechanically, and electronically sound aircraft decelerated through the minimum safe operating speed for the phase of flight to the stick-shaker activation speed. Despite the differences in the sequences of events, a subset of the incidents and accidents had one thing in common - the automation was no longer actively controlling to the airspeed target. This article describes the accident scenarios and design of a modification to the airspeed tape on the primary flight display to explicitly annunciate the absence of active speed control. An experiment to evaluate the efficacy of the enhanced airspeed tape showed faster pilot response time but no differences in correct pilot response. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.</abstract>"
2018,Canada,Flight Experience and Mental Representations of Space,"<title>Flight Experience and Mental Representations of Space</title> <abstract>Objective: This study investigated whether increased flight experience as a pilot was associated with improved small-scale spatial skills and the ability to form a cognitive map of a novel ground-based virtual environment. Background: Early-career civil aviation pilots have been shown to form more accurate cognitive maps of a novel virtual environment than nonpilots. We sought to extend this finding to determine whether cognitive map accuracy was also associated with pilot flight experience. Method: Pilots completed small-scale spatial ability tasks, including assessments of perspective taking and spatial working memory, and then traveled along 4 routes in a virtual environment. Subsequently, they completed 2 tests that assessed their memory for the layout of landmarks in the virtual environment. Results: Pilots with more flight experience did not have more accurate cognitive map representations of the environment than pilots with less flight experience; however, increased flying experience was associated with better performance on a perspective-taking test. Conclusion: Perspective taking has been proposed as central to navigation awareness during flight, and the data reported here suggest it improves with experience. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2018,Sweden,Fit for Flight? Inappropriate Presenteeism Among Swedish Commercial Airline Pilots and Its Threats to Flight Safety,"<title>Fit for Flight? Inappropriate Presenteeism Among Swedish Commercial Airline Pilots and Its Threats to Flight Safety</title> <abstract>Objective: The purpose of this cross-sectional survey study was to investigate the prevalence of presenteeism, attending work when ill, among Swedish commercial airline pilots and how presenteeism relates to mental health and flight safety. Background: Pilots are regulated to refrain from duty when their mental or physical state could endanger safety. Still, the human factor is the greatest contributor to aviation accidents, and mishaps are attributed to human unfitness (physical or mental state of the operator), suggesting that pilots might engage in presenteeism. Presenteeism and its consequences have been studied across several occupational groups, but until now pilots have been neglected. Method: Data were collected using an online self-report questionnaire (N = 1,133) consisting of items investigating presenteeism, mental health, and self-reported error rates. Results: Results demonstrated that 63% of the pilots exhibited acts of inappropriate presenteeism in the past year. Inappropriate presentee pilots and pilots with poor recovery in terms of feelings of rest, physical and mental tiredness, and work-related worry, were also more likely to report committing 5 or more errors when on flight duty in the past 12 months. This relationship was not mediated by mental health, as shown in previous research. Conclusion: This study indicates that pilots operate in states that could jeopardize flight safety and that current regulations might be insufficient to ensure safe flight operations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2018,China,Working Memory: A Criterion of Potential Practicality for Pilot Candidate Selection,"<title>Working Memory: A Criterion of Potential Practicality for Pilot Candidate Selection</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this research was to examine how candidates’ spatial working memory (WM) and visual perspective taking (VPT) skills could predict their training success. Background: To make pilot selection more effective, a body of research has focused on selection criteria. WM and VPT might be highly relevant to pilot training. However, very few studies have directly addressed their roles in training success. Method: Two hundred participants completed the computerized WM and VPT tasks individually at the beginning of flight training. Those who succeeded in the primary phase entered the advanced phase. Logistic regressions were done to determine the associations between WM and VPT and success or failure of training. Results: WM was positively correlated with training success in both primary and advanced phases. After controlling the covariates, WM still had a unique predictive effect on training success in the advanced phase. Conclusion: It could be beneficial to add spatial WM to procedures of pilot candidate selection. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Preflight safety briefings are required prior to every commercial flight. To meet this requirement, airlines often use prerecorded briefings, in the form of audio or video, which can sometimes be supplemented with a live demonstration. Method: One hundred and sixty-two participants were randomly divided into 5 groups—control (no briefing), audio only, audio plus live demonstration, video only, and video plus live demonstration—and exposed to a prerecorded safety briefing. Recall performance in terms of key safety messages was analyzed postbriefing, as well as changes in mood from pre- to postbriefing. Results: Recall of certain key safety information is related to both cabin crew members and the medium in which the safety material is delivered. Native English speakers also recalled more information than their non-native counterparts. Participants' mood was adversely affected in the video condition. Conclusion: These results highlight the limitations associated with the way many airlines presently deliver their preflight safety briefing. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2018,Poland,Selective Attention and Working Memory Under Spatial Disorientation in a Flight Simulator,"<title>Selective Attention and Working Memory Under Spatial Disorientation in a Flight Simulator</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to test the effects of visual and vestibular spatial disorientation on the cognitive performance of military aviators while they were piloting a flight simulator. Background: Spatial disorientation (SD), the inability to correctly determine the position and orientation of the aircraft in relation to the ground, poses a serious threat in aviation and can impair the cognitive performance of pilots while flying. More evidence is needed on the effects of visual and vestibular SD on cognition in flight simulators. Method: Pilots performed an auditory selective attention (duration discrimination) task (Experiment 1, N = 16) or an auditory working memory (N-back) task (Experiment 2, N = 16) while completing 6 different flight profiles in the disorientation and control conditions in the GYRO-IPT flight simulator. The flight scenarios included 3 visual illusions (false horizon, shape constancy, size constancy) and 3 vestibular illusions (somatogyral illusion, Coriolis effect, the leans). Results: In both experiments the cognitive performance (task accuracy) decreased for flight profiles with the leans illusion. Also, the flight performance (measured as the number of control reversal errors) was worse for the false horizon illusion and for the somatogyral illusion in both experiments. Conclusion: The results suggest that SD, particularly the vestibular illusion of the leans, can impair selective attention and working memory processes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Background: Manual flying skills erode due to an extensive use of automation and rare opportunity to practice these skills. Method: One hundred and twenty-six randomly selected pilots of a European airline took part in this experiment, performing a simulated manual raw data precision approach. All of the pilots were allocated to 1 of 4 groups according to their fleet and rank: first officers and captains on short haul, as well as first officers and captains on long haul. A new method to analyze flight-path control strategies by differentiating between constant and variable flight-path errors was proposed. Time-domain measures were taken into account to evaluate sidestick inputs. Results: We distinguished between 2 different flight-path control strategies; both differed in the deviations achieved. In addition, the pilots who predominantly used 1-dimensional sidestick inputs also had smaller deviations from the ideal flight-path. Conclusion: Pilots showed a relationship between manual fine-motor flying skills and recent flight practice, especially in long-haul fleets. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Assessing General Aviation Pilots’ Understanding of Aviation Weather Products,"<title>Assessing General Aviation Pilots’ Understanding of Aviation Weather Products</title> <abstract>Objective: The objective of this article was to develop a written examination to assess general aviation (GA) pilots’ understanding of aviation meteorology products. Background: Although the number of accidents in GA flight continues to decrease over time, one troubling situation is when pilots encounter hazardous weather. Although research has approached this topic from a variety of perspectives, prior research has not offered a detailed inspection of GA pilots’ knowledge about weather concepts and phenomena, weather products, and the implications of weather concepts and products to flight—knowledge that is fundamental for pilots to develop higher order cognitive skills in aviation weather. A valid and reliable assessment tool to measure pilots’ knowledge of weather is not available. Method: A multidisciplinary research team developed a 95-item, multiple-choice aviation meteorology test. The questions were based on Federal Aviation Administation guidance on aviation weather and written according to guidelines for assessment instrument development. Initial validation was done with data collected from 204 GA pilots. Results: The results showed that the test had high internal consistency, had varying degrees of item difficulty, and discriminated between pilots with differing levels of expertise. Conclusion: Findings from this study indicate that a written test on the aviation weather concepts necessary for safe flight has promise for use in both research and practice. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,United States,General Aviation Weather Alerting: The Effectiveness of Different Visual and Tactile Display Characteristics in Supporting Weather-Related Decision Making,"<title>General Aviation Weather Alerting: The Effectiveness of Different Visual and Tactile Display Characteristics in Supporting Weather-Related Decision Making</title> <abstract>Objective: This research analyzed the effects of weather technology interface characteristics on the quality and timeliness of weather-related decision making via mental workload and situational awareness (SA) metrics using flight training devices (FTDs) and follow-up in-flight validation testing. Background: A significant number of fatal general aviation (GA) accidents are attributable to pilots flying into instrument meteorological conditions without the necessary certification for safe operation. Even when takeoff conditions are clear, they can degrade in flight. Pilots might consult in-flight  weather technologies to inform flight-plan-related decisions. Method: GA pilots flew 2 scenarios in FTDs while receiving weather notifications (referred to here as alerts) via complex graphical or smart-watch-based visual displays and under different vibrotactile cuing conditions. In-flight testing examined if vibrotactile cuing effects found in simulation were present in real flight. Results: Results suggest the quality and timeliness of weather-related flight decisions and flight-related SA are better supported when displays use vibrotactile cues and embed alert text within maps rather than present it separately on a smart watch. In-flight data confirmed that pilots can reliably perceive vibrotactile cues in real aircraft. Conclusion: Vibrotactile cues improve the reception of notifications and can reduce cognitive demands while flying. Visual weather information should be displayed on larger screens that are positioned to reduce pilots’ postural reorientation. These findings can inform the design of weather technologies for supporting pilot in-flight decision making. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,Australia,The Variability in Risk Assessment Between Flight Crew,"<title>The Variability in Risk Assessment Between Flight Crew</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this research was to investigate the assessment of situational risk among commercial flight crew, and examine the accuracy with which factors such as experience (i.e., rank, flight hours, license type, recency) and age predict accurate situational risk assessment. Background: Accurate risk assessment by flight crew is critical for safe and efficient air transport operation. Method: The study contained 2 stages. In Stage 1, 6 subject-matter experts rated and categorized the risks involved in 9 aviation-related scenarios, resulting in 3 distinct scenarios, 1 for each of the following risk points: low, medium, and high. In Stage 2, 270 commercial pilots rated the risk in each of the 3 scenarios. Results: The results revealed a consistent overestimation of risk in the low- and medium-risk scenarios. In the medium-risk scenario, pilots who were younger and had fewer flight hours rated the risk consistent with the subject-matter experts. The more experienced and older pilots, however, were more conservative in their risk estimates. Conclusion: Risk assessment varies among flight crew, with the highest variability in situations involving low or medium levels of risk. Demographic variables such as flight experience (i.e., hours) and age were related, in part with accuracy of risk assessment. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Barriers and Facilitators to Voluntary Reporting and Their Impact on Safety Culture,"<title>Barriers and Facilitators to Voluntary Reporting and Their Impact on Safety Culture</title> <abstract>Objective: Determine barriers and facilitators to effective voluntary reporting system (VRS) operation. Background: As human error accounts for a larger portion of accidents and incidents in high-risk industries, federal agencies that define regulations and guidelines promote various safety management techniques, including more robust safety data collection. VRSs aim to identify and address “near misses” (errors identified before resulting in negative outcomes) through employee disclosure of committed errors and violations. Despite their value, VRSs are underutilized. Method: A literature review was conducted to understand successful safety management practices and challenges, and define reporting requirements for accidents, incidents, and near misses (which rely on voluntary disclosure). Variations in the policies, processes, and utility of several VRSs were explored, and common themes were identified. Interviews were then conducted with VRS developers, users, and managers to further explore these themes. Results: The literature review narrowed the focus to confidential, nonpunitive VRSs for process and product safety concerns, such as the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). Common themes exposed 8 categories of barriers and facilitators to effective VRS operation, participation, and use of report data. The literature review verified and elaborated on these barriers, and offered solutions (facilitators) based on personal observations and experiences. Conclusion: Consistent themes associated with effective and ineffective VRS operation can be used to improve VRS participation and the effectiveness of error prediction and prevention capabilities. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Predictive Validity of Spatial Ability and Perceptual Speed Tests for Aviator Training,"<title>Predictive Validity of Spatial Ability and Perceptual Speed Tests for Aviator Training</title> <abstract>Objective: To present a multistudy examination of spatial ability and perceptual speed tests as predictors of Air Force aviator academic and flying training outcomes. Background: Whereas verbal and math tests are commonly used in academic and pre-employment selection, spatial ability and perceptual speed testing are less common. Spatial ability and perceptual speed tests have been a mainstay in U.S. Air Force aviation training selection batteries for decades, as part of the process for selecting aviation training candidates. Method and Results: Factor analysis (Study 1) of spatial, perceptual speed, and academic aptitude tests shows a 2-factor solution. Meta-analysis results (Study 2) of the predictive validity of spatial and perceptual speed tests relative to verbal, math, and technical knowledge tests show spatial ability, aviation knowledge, and perceptual speed tests are better significant predictors of aviator flying performance, whereas academic aptitude best predicts classroom performance. Incremental validity analyses (Study 3) of spatial and perceptual speed above academic and technical knowledge for academic and pilot trainee flying performance were performed. Although spatial ability lacks incremental validity over academic and technical aptitude, perceptual speed has incremental validity above academic and technical aptitude for predicting pilot trainee flying performance. Conclusion: Perceptual speed, an aspect of spatial ability, can provide incremental predictive validity beyond academic and technical knowledge measures alone for applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields like military aviation. ©, This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.</abstract>"

Background: Prior research identified the costs of such 3D perspective hazard displays, presented from an exocentric perspective, because of their ambiguity in presenting spatial relations in an unstructured 3D space. Research also supported the advantage of display overlay, particularly when both databases (traffic and weather) need to be integrated to make hazard avoidance judgments. The two variables had not been examined in conjunction. Method: Seventeen certified flight instructors flew a series of hazard avoidance maneuvers in a part-task simulator, with four displays, created by the combination of 3D versus 2-dimensional (2D) perspective and separate versus overlay hazard formats. Positioning of traffic and weather that would make it necessary to avoid hazards was designed to allow the study of both the strengths of overlay and weaknesses of 3D integration. Results: The data clearly indicated that hazard avoidance was worse with the 3D perspective display, for both traffic and weather hazards, and pointed to ambiguity as the cause. Display overlay was better than separation, but only when the task required consulting both databases. Conclusion: 3D perspective displays are not advised for hazard presentation on the flight deck. Overlays can be helpful, as long as clutter issues are addressed. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,United States,Perceptions of Cockpit Configurations: A Culture and Gender Analysis,"<title>Perceptions of Cockpit Configurations: A Culture and Gender Analysis</title> <abstract>Objective: With the advancement of technology in recent years the topic of autonomous, pilotless cockpits have emerged. The rhetoric of this article revolves around passenger perceptions and their willingness to fly on board such aircraft. Background: Although studies have been conducted to gauge similar consumer perceptions, this study compared 3 different 2-pilot configurations based on pilot gender to that of the autonomous or automated cockpit. These configurations included 2 male pilots, 1 male and 1 female pilot, and 2 female pilots. Method: 433 participants from India and the United States were recruited using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and responded to questions designed to measure consumer perceptions on the topic at hand. The study used Rice, Mehta, et al.’s (2015) willingness-to-fly scale to collect the data. Results: The results suggested that all participants were more willing to fly on board all 3 types of 2-pilot configurations as opposed to the autonomous cockpit. However, Indian male participants showed a decrease in willingness to fly on board the 2-female-pilot configurations as opposed to the other 2-human-pilot configurations. Additionally, U.S. participants were much less willing to fly on board the autonomous configuration as compared to their Indian counterparts. Conclusion: The findings suggest that all participants were least willing to fly on aircraft flown completely by an autopilot. Differences were also noted based on pilot gender. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,Netherlands,The Influence of Surprise on Upset Recovery Performance in Airline Pilots,"<title>The Influence of Surprise on Upset Recovery Performance in Airline Pilots</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to test if performance of airline pilots, in performing an aerodynamic stall recovery procedure, decreases when they are surprised, compared to when they anticipate a stall event. Background: New flight-safety regulations for commercial aviation recommend the introduction of surprise and startle in upset prevention and recovery training. This calls for more evidence on the effects of surprise on pilot performance, as well as methods to effectively induce surprise in training simulators. Method: The study took place in a motion-base simulator with a poststall aerodynamic model. Using a within-subjects design, the recovery performance of 20 pilots was tested in 2 conditions: 1 anticipated condition, and 1 surprise condition. In addition to flight parameters, subjective and physiological data relating to surprise and startle were measured. Results: Pilots had significantly more difficulties with adhering to the recovery procedure in the surprise condition compared to the anticipation condition. The subjective and physiological measures confirmed that the manipulation mainly increased surprise, and to a lesser extent also startle. Conclusion: The results suggest that pilots have more difficulty in managing an upset situation (i.e., an aerodynamic stall) when this situation is presented unexpectedly, underlining that upset prevention and recovery training should include elements of surprise. ©, © The Authors.

2017,United States,Multimodal Information Presentation in Support of NextGen Operations,"<title>Multimodal Information Presentation in Support of NextGen Operations</title> <abstract>Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of visual, auditory, tactile, and redundant auditory-visual information presentation in the context of a medium-fidelity ‘Next Generation Air Transportation System’ (NextGen) flight simulation. Background: Data overload, especially in the visual channel, and associated breakdowns in monitoring represent a major challenge in aviation. These problems are expected to worsen with NextGen, which will require pilots to manage increased amounts of data and adopt new responsibilities. The introduction of multimodal interfaces (interfaces that distribute information across multiple sensory channels) has been proposed as a means to offload the overburdened visual channel and thus address data overload. Method: Experienced commercial airline pilots completed 2 scenarios using a medium-fidelity flight simulator. For each scenario, NextGen tasks and events were presented either using technology that is currently available (visual and auditory displays) or technology proposed as part of NextGen design concepts (i.e., tactile and redundant displays). Performance was measured based on response time and accuracy. Results: Faster responses were observed for redundant displays, compared to either vision or audition alone. No significant benefit of redundancy was found for accuracy and workload did not mediate redundancy effects. For traffic events, there were faster response times with tactile displays, but higher response accuracy with auditory displays. Conclusion: The findings from this research add to the knowledge base in multimodal information processing and can inform the design of displays for NextGen operations. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2017,France - United States,Pilot Flying and Pilot Monitoring’s Aircraft State Awareness During Go-Around Execution in Aviation: A Behavioral and Eye Tracking Study,"<title>Pilot Flying and Pilot Monitoring’s Aircraft State Awareness During Go-Around Execution in Aviation: A Behavioral and Eye Tracking Study</title> <abstract>Objective: Examination of the performance and visual scanning of aircrews during final approach and an unexpected go-around maneuver. Background: Accident and incident analyses have revealed that go-around procedures are often imperfectly performed because of their complexity, their high time stress, and their rarity of occurrence that avails little time for practice. We wished to examine this experimentally and establish the frequency and nature of errors in both flight-performance and visual scanning. Method: We collected flight-performance (e.g., errors in procedures, excessive flight deviations) and eye-tracking data of 12 flight crews who performed final approach and go-around flight phases in realistic full-flight transport-category simulators. Results: The pilot performance results showed that two thirds of the crews committed errors including critical trajectory deviations during go-arounds, a precursor of accidents. Eye-tracking analyses revealed that the cross-checking process was not always efficient in detecting flight-path deviations when they occurred. Ocular data also highlighted different visual strategies between the 2 crew members during the 2 flight phases. Conclusion: This study reveals that the go-around is a challenging maneuver. It demonstrates the advantages of eye tracking and suggests that it is a valuable tool for the explicit training of attention allocation during go-arounds to enhance flight safety. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2016,United Kingdom,Investigating Non-Technical Skills in Scottish and English Aircraft Maintenance Teams Using a Mixed Methodology of Interviews and a Questionnaire,"<title>Investigating Non-Technical Skills in Scottish and English Aircraft Maintenance Teams Using a Mixed Methodology of Interviews and a Questionnaire</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the non-technical skills used by aircraft maintenance crews. Background: Aircraft maintenance is a vital aspect of aviation, with failures in aircraft maintenance linked to one third of aircraft malfunctions. Research within other high-risk industries indicates the importance of non-technical skills in ensuring effective performance and reducing the risk of error. Method: A mixed-methods approach was used: Aircraft maintenance workers from 2 locations (Scotland and England, n = 24) were interviewed using the critical incident technique. A short survey was then distributed (n = 31) to further explore worker perceptions of non-technical skill usage across different organizational locations. Results: The interviews identified team-based non-technical skills as Situation awareness, decision making, leadership, teamwork and communication, and task management. Lone worker non-technical skills were identified as Situation awareness, decision making, and task management. The questionnaire study indicated that perception of task management was significantly more negative than for situation awareness, leadership, teamwork, and communication. Moreover, participants from Scottish units were significantly more positive about situation awareness and teamwork than their English counterparts. Conclusion: The results indicate that non-technical skills are an important aspect of aircraft maintenance workers’ work performance and safety, mirroring the findings reported within other high-risk industries. Variance across organizational units suggests future training programs must be tailored to fit each team. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2016,Canada,Exposure to Disturbance Motion During Practice in an Analog of a Flight Task Influences Flight Control of Naive Participants,"<title>Exposure to Disturbance Motion During Practice in an Analog of a Flight Task Influences Flight Control of Naive Participants</title> <abstract>Objective: This article examines whether strategies and performance differed depending on whether naive participants were exposed to motion disturbance during practice of a tracking task. Background: Despite several decades of research, there is still debate regarding whether physical motion during flight simulation training improves later performance. Evidence suggests that presence of disturbance affects the utility of motion on transfer of training studies. Therefore, an important question is whether performance with disturbance motion (e.g., wind gusts) at test depends on whether participants practice with disturbance motion. Method: Naïve participants flew through a series of suspended rings in a motion-based simulator. Practice was with or without correlated (joystick control) and random motion (disturbance). The task was an analog of a flight task, modified to accommodate nonpilots. A quasi-transfer design included two practice blocks followed by two test blocks that incorporated both correlated and random motion. Results: No differences were detected in accuracy, but groups who practiced without disturbance made smaller joystick movements during both practice and test phases compared to those who practiced with disturbance. Conclusion: Practice without disturbance resulted in adoption of a different (possibly more efficient) joystick control strategy compared to practice with disturbance. The results suggest that during training, some control elements should be learned under relatively easy conditions, subsequently increasing in difficulty (e.g., add disturbance) at an optimal point in training. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2016,United States,Current NEXRAD Cannot Reliably Enable Safe Flight Around Heavy Weather,"<title>Current NEXRAD Cannot Reliably Enable Safe Flight Around Heavy Weather</title> <abstract>Objective: We wished to assess whether current-generation in-cockpit looping Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) can reliably enable safe flight around severe (“heavy”) convective weather. Background: Numerous studies suggest that estimating the closest point of approach (CPA) to heavy weather is difficult, and that current in-cockpit NEXRAD may be intrinsically inadequate for the task. Method: To investigate theoretically, we first examined the visual information present in looping NEXRAD. This predicted inherent task difficulty. Next, to investigate empirically, we developed a mathematical model of an “ideal storm,” generated a looping NEXRAD-type part-task simulation, and tested 21 general aviation (GA) pilots to measure effects of weather system depth (19 vs. 40 nm), and the opening and closing of gaps at various closure rates between cells (14, 7, 0, 7, 14 kt). Results: For the values tested, weather system depth had no significant effect on clearance from heavy weather (>40 dBZ reflectivity). However, weather movement greatly degraded safety. Moreover, it did not seem to matter if movement was as slow as 7 kt, nor whether gaps were opening or closing. Any weather movement made an already difficult task more so. Conclusion: Analysis suggests the necessity of adding future-predicted weather plus a range ring. Without these two key elements, judgment of CPA will clearly remain difficult. Training is also necessary to improve performance, but is unlikely to be sufficient. © , This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.</abstract>"
2016,Australia,The Use of Simulation in Ab Initio Pilot Training,"<title>The Use of Simulation in Ab Initio Pilot Training</title> <abstract>Objective: This article examines the practical impacts of integrating simulation-based training into an ab initio pilot-training course. Background: As flight simulation technology has become more advanced, and the associated costs have been reduced, there has been a corresponding increase in the use of flight simulation during ab initio phases of pilot training. Subsequently, important questions have arisen regarding the utility of simulation-based training to develop students’ rudimentary piloting skills. Method: The progression of 29 students completing a course consisting of 25% simulation is compared to a baseline sample of 62 students (sourced from historical data) completing the same course prior to the integration of additional simulation-based training. Results: The integration of simulation was found to have 2 primary impacts. Although a small decrease in aircraft training hours was evident, there was also a significant increase in the overall training time once simulation-based training was incorporated. Conclusion: Simulation will always provide significant safety and risk-reduction benefits to flight training; however, when considering the practical implications of integrating simulation-based training, the current data provide a cautionary tale that positive outcomes for training efficiency and cost-effectiveness are not always guaranteed. More targeted inquiry is still needed to assist flight schools to properly operationalize the findings from the research literature to effectively integrate simulation into their flight-training curriculums. © 2016 Crown Copyright.</abstract>"
2016,United States,Human Performance Risks and Benefits of Adaptive Systems on the Flight Deck,"<title>Human Performance Risks and Benefits of Adaptive Systems on the Flight Deck</title> <abstract>Objective: Human performance risks and benefits of adaptive systems were identified through a systematic analysis and pilot evaluation of adaptive system component types and characteristics. Background: As flight-deck automation is able to process ever more types of information in sophisticated ways to identify situations, it is becoming more realistic for adaptive systems to adapt behavior based on their own authority. Method: A framework was developed to describe the types and characteristics of adaptive system components and was used to perform a risk–benefit analysis to identify potential issues. Subsequently, eight representative adaptive system storyboards were developed for an evaluation with pilots to augment the analysis results and to explore more detailed issues and potential risk mitigations. Results: Analysis identified the principal drivers of adaptive “triggering conditions” risk as complexity and transparency. It also identified the drivers of adaptations risks and benefits as the task level and the level of control versus information adaptation. Conclusion: Pilots did not seem to distinguish between adaptive automation and normal automation if the rules were simple and obvious; however, their perception of risk increased when the level of complexity and opacity of triggering conditions reached a point where its behavior was perceived as nondeterministic. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2016,United States,"Effects of NextGen Concepts of Operation for Separation Assurance and Interval Management on Air Traffic Controller Situation Awareness, Workload, and Performance","<title>Effects of NextGen Concepts of Operation for Separation Assurance and Interval Management on Air Traffic Controller Situation Awareness, Workload, and Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: Determine how combinations of NextGen-automation concepts for separation assurance and spacing affect air traffic controller (ATCo) situation awareness, workload, and performance. Background: In previous research, situation awareness was not measured with valid and reliable instruments. Previous work also evaluated separation assurance and spacing concepts individually, and did not examine weather. Method: Retired ATCos worked en route and transitional sectors. Four operating concepts for separation assurance and spacing were tested based on whether automation or ATCo was responsible for each function. Standard methods for assessing workload and situation awareness were used; performance measures included safety and efficiency. Results: Workload was lowest when both functions were automated; however, situation awareness depended on operating concept and sector. In the en route sector, the highest levels of situation awareness were found for ATCo-managed separation assurance and automation-managed spacing. In the transitional sector, the highest situation awareness occurred when ATCos performed both functions. The numbers of loss of separation were highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance; sector complexity depended on weather, but only for automation-managed separation assurance. Spacing efficiency was highest for ATCo-managed separation assurance, but more communications were required. Conclusion: In air traffic management, separation assurance and spacing functions interact with each other in determining ATCo workload, situation awareness, and performance, depending on sector characteristics and weather. Therefore, evaluations of NextGen-automation solutions must include multiple concepts of operation, and involve different sectors and environmental conditions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2015,Denmark - Japan - Norway,Impact of Mindfulness Training on Physiological Measures of Stress and Objective Measures of Attention Control in a Military Helicopter Unit,"<title>Impact of Mindfulness Training on Physiological Measures of Stress and Objective Measures of Attention Control in a Military Helicopter Unit</title> <abstract>Objective: This study sought to determine if mindfulness training (MT) has a measurable impact on stress and attentional control as measured by objective physiological and psychological means. Background: Periods of persistent, intensive work demands are known to compromise recovery and attentional capacity. The effects of 4-month MT on salivary cortisol and performance on 2 computer-based cognitive tasks were tested on a military helicopter unit exposed to a prolonged period of high workload. Methods: MT participants were compared to a wait list control group on levels of saliva cortisol and performance on a go–no go test and a test of stimulus-driven attentional capture. Participants also reported mental demands on the go–no go test, time of wakeup, sleep duration, quality of sleep, outcome expectancies, physical activity level, self-perceived mindfulness, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: The results from a mixed between–within analysis revealed that the MT participants compared to the control group had a larger pre to post increase in high- and low-cortisol slopes, and decrease in perceived mental demand imposed by the go–no go test. Conclusion: MT alleviates some of the physiological stress response and the subjective mental demands of challenging tasks in a military helicopter unit during a period of high workload. © 2016, Anders Meland, Kazuma Ishimatsu, Anne Marte Pensgaard, Anthony Wagstaff, Vivianne Fonne, Anne Helene Garde, and Anette Harris.</abstract>"
2015,United States,Airdrop Guidance Display Format for Precision Airdrop Application on an Auxiliary Display Equipped Aircraft,"<title>Airdrop Guidance Display Format for Precision Airdrop Application on an Auxiliary Display Equipped Aircraft</title> <abstract>Objective: To evaluate a new display format for Airdrop Guidance intended to enhance precision-flight capability for high-altitude single-pass airdrop profiles. Background: Operational military environments are demanding that airdrops are increasingly precise while simultaneously protecting Air Force assets through high-altitude drops. Efforts are underway at the Air Force Research Laboratory to minimize the negative effect of human performance variability on high-altitude airdrop accuracy. Precision guidance to the calculated air release point, as presented through the new display, offers potential reduction in flight performance variability. Method: Four U.S. Air Force pilots, current in the C-17, participated in a within-subjects evaluation of the airdrop guidance display. Each pilot was scheduled to fly a total of 16 trials. The out-the-window scene (presented or blanked) effects were also assessed. Results: Results suggest improved performance over existing methods of airdrop guidance as measured by both aircraft position at green light and the comparison between actual and optimal flightpaths. Conclusion: The airdrop guidance display format, tested for precision flight, could significantly reduce flight performance error associated with high-altitude airdrop missions. Additionally, implementation of the display shows potential for increasing overall airdrop accuracy. © © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2015,Australia - Canada,Flight Examiners’ Methods of Ascertaining Pilot Proficiency,"<title>Flight Examiners’ Methods of Ascertaining Pilot Proficiency</title> <abstract>Objective: To determine how flight examiners reason and which methods they use when assessing the competencies of pilots for continued accreditation purposes and type-rating training. Background: Early work on pilot performance assessment focused on measurement models, including the accuracy and reliability of the scores attributed to the human factors variables included. More recent studies investigated the nature of the evidence that flight examiners used. No previous studies were found on how flight examiners assess line pilots’ performance during flight training and examination. Method: This study employed methods typical for cognitive anthropology, combining ethnographic observations of debriefings and interviews, stimulated recall concerning debriefing, and modified think-aloud protocols of assessment of flight episodes. Twenty-three flight examiners from 5 regional airlines were observed and interviewed in 3 contexts. Results: The data revealed that flight examiners used the documentary method, where initial observations are treated as documentary evidence of underlying phenomena (e.g., situational awareness, decision making) while presupposing these phenomena for making and categorizing the observations. Flight examiners, using a variety of techniques, actively create situations for obtaining additional observations that further substantiate the presupposed underlying phenomena. Conclusion: Even when flight examiners use rating scales, their assessment method is based on categorization of facts and, therefore, shares similarities with medical diagnosis. Suggested quality improvement measures include increasing awareness of diagnostic error, developing diagnostic tools, and developing means to measure diagnostic errors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2015,Germany,Interrater Reliability at the Top End: Measures of Pilots’ Nontechnical Performance,"<title>Interrater Reliability at the Top End: Measures of Pilots’ Nontechnical Performance</title> <abstract>Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze influences on interrater reliability and within-group agreement within a highly experienced rater group when assessing pilots’ nontechnical skills. Background: Nontechnical skills of pilots are crucial for the conduct of safe flight operations. To train and assess these skills, reliable expert ratings are required. Literature shows to some degree that interrater reliability is influenced by factors related to the targets, scenarios, rating tools, or the raters themselves. Method: Thirty-seven type-rating examiners from a European airline assessed the performance of 4 flight crews based on video recordings using LOSA and adapted NOTECHS tools. We calculated r<inf>wg</inf> and ICC(3) to measure within-group agreement and interrater reliability. Results: The findings indicated that within-group agreement and interrater reliability were not always acceptable. It was shown that the performance of outstanding pilots was rated with the highest within-group agreement. For cognitive aspects of performance, interrater reliability was higher than for social aspects of performance. Agreement was lower on the pass–fail level than for the distinguished performance scales. Conclusion: These results suggest pass–fail decisions should not be based exclusively on nontechnical skill ratings. We furthermore recommend that regulatory authorities more systematically address interrater reliability in airline instructor training. Airlines as well as training facilities should be encouraged to demonstrate sufficient interrater reliability when using their rating tools. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2015,Israel,Grip Force as a Measure of Stress in Aviation,"<title>Grip Force as a Measure of Stress in Aviation</title> <abstract>Objective: We conducted an exploratory investigation of whether grip force could be an indicator of stress in aviation. Background: Pilots might experience stress when anticipating failure to meet task demands and therefore, higher levels of stress can be used as a trigger for engaging automatic assistance. An unobtrusive measure of stress in aviation might be the grip force pilots exert on the control stick that could increase due to the intensified muscle tonus that characterizes psychological stress. Method: Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group and performed tracking tasks. Participants in the experimental group were told that as of the second half of the experiment their compensation for the experiment would partly depend on their performance. No such conditioning existed for the control group. Grip force was then measured using a sensor on the control stick. Results: Grip force significantly increased in the second half of the experiment in the experimental group, but decreased in the control group. Similar interaction between experimental group and experimental half was also evident with self-reported stress and galvanic skin response (GSR), yet increases within the experimental group were not significant. Grip force also moderately correlated with GSR, possibly suggesting that they responded to the same construct. Conclusion: Findings provided a preliminary indication that grip force could be used to measure stress in aviation, meriting further research exploration. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2015,Netherlands,Stall Recovery in a Centrifuge-Based Flight Simulator With an Extended Aerodynamic Model,"<title>Stall Recovery in a Centrifuge-Based Flight Simulator With an Extended Aerodynamic Model</title> <abstract>We investigated the performance of 12 airline pilots in recovering from an asymmetrical stall in a flight simulator featuring an extended aerodynamic model of a transport-category aircraft, and a centrifuge-based motion platform capable of generating enhanced buffet motion and g-cueing. All pilots had difficulties in applying the correct recovery template, as their initial response was to counter the wing drop rather than to unload the aircraft. Reproduction of actual g-loads led to significantly longer recoveries, more secondary stick-shaker events, lower maximum load factors, larger altitude loss, and higher speeds. It also resulted in higher workload. We conclude that the extended simulator envelope is useful for demonstrating stall characteristics of transport aircraft. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2015,United States,Flight-Deck Surface Trajectory-Based Operations,"<title>Flight-Deck Surface Trajectory-Based Operations</title> <abstract>The results of three piloted simulations investigating flight-deck surface trajectory-based operations (STBO) are presented. Commercial transport pilots were given taxi clearances with time and speed components on the primary flight display and were required to taxi to the departing runway or intermediate intersections. Results show that when pilots were provided with speed-only taxi clearances, pilots either had poor required time of arrival (RTA) conformance with acceptable estimates of attentional distribution and safety, or had good RTA conformance with unacceptable attentional distribution and safety estimates. A flight-deck error-nulling algorithm/display allowed pilots to conform accurately with taxi RTA clearances while maintaining safety. Results are discussed in terms of pilot multitasking in the busy airport surface operations environment. © 2015, This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.</abstract>"
2015,United States,VFR Into IMC: Using Simulation to Improve Weather-Related Decision-Making,"<title>VFR Into IMC: Using Simulation to Improve Weather-Related Decision-Making</title> <abstract>Safety-related training policies restrict pilots from encountering challenging weather during flight training. This potentially inhibits the development of critical decision-making skills. To identify gaps in weather-related flight training, high-fidelity weather-simulation was developed to re-create historical weather events. Sixteen visual-only pilots and 16 instrument-rated pilots flew a simulated cross-country flight under visual flight rules in marginally visual weather that encountered instrument conditions. Procedural performance and experience-related demographic factors were analyzed to identify key flight skills and experience that contributed to safe weather-related decisions. Previous experience with actual instrument weather was found to be the only statistically significant demographic predictor of safe performance. Pilots who performed more safely were more likely to use in-cockpit weather information during the flight to detect and avoid instrument weather. Implications of this study and opportunities for future research are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

No objective measures of performance were included in this study. Subjective measures of mindfulness, mental skills, and performance-related anxiety were administered before and after the intervention, including a semistructured interview at the study’s conclusion after the intervention. Qualitative feedback and measures of mindfulness were collected via e-mail at 12 and 24 months during follow-up. During posttraining, there was a reduction in somatic anxiety related to performance and improvements in self-perceived skills associated with mindfulness, attention regulation, and arousal regulation. Mindfulness scores remained higher throughout the follow-up. Time-consuming plenary sessions and the amount of recommended, out-of-class training were found to be potential drawbacks of MT. Overall the findings indicate that MT might be a viable complement to existing mental training for high-performance populations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2014,United States,Comparative Analysis of Procedures for Dual and Triple Closely Spaced Parallel Runways,"<title>Comparative Analysis of Procedures for Dual and Triple Closely Spaced Parallel Runways</title> <abstract>This article provides a comparative analysis of 2 experiments on procedures to increase the capacity of closely spaced parallel runways under low-visibility conditions. The common goal for both studies was to achieve visual meteorological capacity under instrument meteorological conditions, when landing aircraft on parallel runways 750 ft apart. Using a high-fidelity flight deck simulator, both studies investigated procedures related to breakout maneuvers on final approach during off-nominal conditions. The first study investigated procedures for 2 parallel runways (involving a leading and trailing aircraft) and the second study examined 3 parallel runways separated by 750 ft, investigating procedures for 3 simultaneously arriving aircraft (leading, center, and right aircraft). In both studies, off-nominal events were introduced during the approach. In some cases the wake of the leading aircraft drifted too close to the aircraft behind. In others, the leading aircraft deviated off its course and blundered toward the trailing aircraft. Statistical analysis examined the effects of approach echelon (2-runway vs. 3-runway), breakout cause, and breakout location on the dependent measures of breakout trajectory cross-track error, breakout trajectory track angle error, pilot workload, and pilot situation awareness. Although revealing differences between the study conditions, results also show accurate cross-track and track angle error levels (i.e., high levels of breakout trajectory accuracy), manageable pilot workload, and high levels of pilot situation awareness across all conditions in both studies. Results suggest possible avenues of future adaptation of dual and triple parallel runway operations (e.g., improving pilot training) and also show potential promise of the concept. © 2014, Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2014,New Zealand,"Effect of Mild Hypoxia on Working Memory, Complex Logical Reasoning, and Risk Judgment","<title>Effect of Mild Hypoxia on Working Memory, Complex Logical Reasoning, and Risk Judgment</title> <abstract>Mild hypoxia, typically equivalent to a pressurized aircraft cabin altitude of 2,438 m (8,000 ft), does not generally affect well-learned cognitive, vigilance, and perceptual-motor performance. Learning and novel and complex cognitive tasks involving multiple demands, however, might be impaired. This study evaluated whether complex cognition-as assessed by complex reasoning, multiple memory, and risk judgment-was impaired during mild hypoxia. Using a normobaric single-blind crossover design, 25 healthy nonsmoking male participants breathed normoxic (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.206) or hypoxic air (F<inf>i</inf>O<inf>2</inf> = 0.143) equivalent to 2,438 m for 2 hr and performed the following tasks at baseline, 30 min, and 90 min: (a) a complex logical reasoning task that assessed accuracy, response time, and a reasoning quality index for easy (nonconflict valid), difficult (nonconflict invalid), fairly difficult (conflict valid), and very difficult (conflict invalid) syllogisms; (b) a multiple memory test that assessed sentence judgment error, working memory span, and prospective memory; and (c) a simple vigilance psychomotor task that assessed the frequency and mean time that a disc was outside a target area and braking reaction time. They also completed a self-perceived risk judgement questionnaire near the end of each exposure. After 90 min, the mean change in working memory span for mild hypoxia (M = 0.9, SD = 4.6) was significantly less than for normoxia (M = 4.4, SD = 7.2). The reasoning quality index for conflict invalid syllogisms for mild hypoxia (M = 0.22, SD = 0.29) was marginally significantly less than for normoxia (M = 0.39, SD = 0.35). The chances of these findings occurring by chance cannot be discounted, but are small. Although this study suggests that mild hypoxia might impair working memory and complex logical reasoning involving difficult conflicts, further studies using more discerning tests of cognition are warranted. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2014,United States,Improving the Pilot Selection System: Statistical Approaches and Selection Processes,"<title>Improving the Pilot Selection System: Statistical Approaches and Selection Processes</title> <abstract>Pilot selection systems traditionally use one of three statistical approaches to model candidate performance: multiple linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression. This article reviews the literature comparing selection decisions using these three approaches and compares the classification accuracy of linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression to the results from two Monte Carlo simulations. Methods for adjusting to a pilot shortage are described for each statistical approach. In the second half of the article, we describe a selection system using a progressive process, rather than the traditional single- or multistage process. We discuss how system operators can adjust each of the processes to deal with a pilot shortage. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

2014,France,Why Aircraft Maintenance Technicians Sometimes Do Not Use Their Maintenance Documents: Towards a New Qualitative Perspective,"<title>Why Aircraft Maintenance Technicians Sometimes Do Not Use Their Maintenance Documents: Towards a New Qualitative Perspective</title> <abstract>The aim of this article is to present an exploratory study aiming to understand the use of maintenance documentation by the technicians in the aircraft maintenance context and why they do not systematically use it. We seek to establish a global model based on the results. Previous studies can provide us with an understanding of why aircraft maintenance technicians sometimes do not follow the requisite procedure. Here we use these empirical data and psychological models as a framework, and consider the use by an aircraft maintenance technician of a document specifically as an information-seeking task and as a secondary task. A qualitative survey involving 13 maintenance technicians was conducted, with observations and semidirected interviews. The survey gives preliminary results about why, when, and how technicians use their maintenance documents, and why they sometimes do not use them although they are required to do so. Thus, the decision by an aircraft technician to use or not use a prescribed document in a maintenance operation should be viewed in terms of a conflict among 3 priorities: safety, legality, and efficiency. However, the explorative nature of the study involves the need to deal with the issue in depth. It could allow to validate or not the conflict of the three priorities. The results presented here could be the basis for further study to this purpose. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2014,Germany,The Role of the Helicopter Pilot in Terms of Relevant Requirements for Helicopter Takeoff,"<title>The Role of the Helicopter Pilot in Terms of Relevant Requirements for Helicopter Takeoff</title> <abstract>Currently, the German Aerospace Center performs research on assistance systems for helicopters that help pilots to perform their missions even in bad weather conditions. One part of the assistance system is the navigation system with automatic flight path planning. The objective of this article is to clarify if pilots perform the planning of flight paths in the same way. An interview with 68 participants was conducted to evaluate essential differences between the pilots' cognitive processes and build a basis for the user-centered design of the navigation system. The interview assessed user-specific requirements that can be used as input for the path planning algorithms. The results recommend the usage of individual pilot requirements for path planning applications. With individually adjusted navigation systems, the potential mismatch between pilots' expectations and the actually computed flight paths is expected to be minimized. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.

During a flight simulation, 10 3-member aircrews were confronted with 2 events associated with low risk level (technical failure) and high risk level (threat to flight safety). In high-risk decision situations, low-flexible crews expressed their personal opinions more frequently than high-flexible crews, but they tended to argue by recalling procedures, whereas high-flexible crews more frequently argued by describing the context of the situation. However, overall, the frequency of dissent and argumentation was low, suggesting an impact of cognitive cost of these activities in risky situations. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2013,New Zealand,Barriers to Intra-Aircraft Communication and Safety: The Perspective of the Flight Attendants,"<title>Barriers to Intra-Aircraft Communication and Safety: The Perspective of the Flight Attendants</title> <abstract>Failures of communication and teamwork between cabin crew and flight deck crew have been implicated in a number of fatal accidents involving commercial aircraft. This study was designed to identify perceived barriers to effective teamwork and communication between pilots and flight attendants in airline operations. The nominal group technique (NGT) was used to gather data from 18 flight attendant focus groups involving 100 flight attendants operating on both narrow-bodied and wide-bodied jet aircraft from a major air carrier. The NGT focus group methodology generated both barriers and solutions to communication from the flight attendant perspective in the following key areas: the locked flight deck door and interphone protocols; ""sterile cockpit"" standard operating procedures (SOPs); preflight briefings; knowledge of basic aircraft terminology; debriefings after incidents; and contractual differences in hotels, meals, and allowances. An emphasis on joint crew resource management (CRM) training between pilots and flight attendants provides the most appropriate way to address these perceived barriers. The solutions generated should be written into CRM and emergency procedures (EP) course content. Training opportunities should be provided to allow both flight deck and cabin crew a better understanding of the other's role and workload patterns. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2013,Canada,Effects of Lighting and Distraction on the Black Hole Illusion in Visual Approaches,"<title>Effects of Lighting and Distraction on the Black Hole Illusion in Visual Approaches</title> <abstract>Two possible causes of the black hole illusion (BHI), lighting and distraction, were examined using distance estimations in nonpilots. In a computer-simulated cockpit environment, participants estimated distance across 2 lighting conditions and 3 levels of distraction. Participants significantly underestimated distance at night and overestimated distance during the day (p =.004). An interaction between lighting and distance from runway (p =.040) was suggestive of the BHI. Current findings help support the idea that lighting plays a significant role in the accuracy of distance estimation, possibly contributing to the BHI, and that BHI might result from a disruption of optic flow. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2013,United States,Functional Allocation of Roles Between Humans and Automation for a Pairing Tool Used for Simultaneous Approaches,"<title>Functional Allocation of Roles Between Humans and Automation for a Pairing Tool Used for Simultaneous Approaches</title> <abstract>Aircraft operations on parallel runways continue to motivate research into tools that can improve capacity safely by defining and automating procedures. However, there is no formal process or automation tool today to assist the air traffic controller with pairing aircraft for simultaneous approaches. To address this need, a controller-based aircraft pairing tool to assist controllers in pairing and aligning aircraft for simultaneous arrivals to parallel runways 750 ft apart was developed. Two simulation studies conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center evaluated different stages of evolution of this tool. The respective roles of the controller and the automation tool were adjusted in the second experiment based on the results of the first experiment. Results indicate improvement on all dependent variables in the second study and suggest an implementation in a broader sense in light of the benefits provided by ""adaptable"" automation (Scerbo, 2001) where changes in the levels of automation are evoked by the user's actions. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Meyer's (2001, 2004) compliance-reliance model indicates that false-alarm-prone and miss-prone automated aids affect operator behavior differently. This study integrates system-wide trust theory with Meyer's compliance-reliance model. Participants monitored 8 gauges, each augmented by an automated aid. Aid 1 was either 100% or 70% reliable (either false alarm- or miss-prone), whereas the other aids were perfectly reliable. Participants generally employed a system-wide trust strategy, but this effect was stronger for false alarms compared to misses. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2013,United States,Pilot-ATC Communication Conflicts: Implications for NextGen,"<title>Pilot-ATC Communication Conflicts: Implications for NextGen</title> <abstract>In the planned NextGen aviation operations, it will be critical to ensure shared situational understanding and cooperative problem solving between aircrews and air traffic controllers (ATC). A first step in predicting how future changes will impact flight crews and ATC is to examine the current system and to pinpoint problematic areas that could be ameliorated or exacerbated by advanced automation and heavier traffic density. In this study, we coded Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports identified as having communication conflicts between pilots and ATC. Results describe types of conflict, operational context, phase of flight, operator states, and situations conducive to communication conflicts, risk perception differences, and inappropriate resolution strategies. Reports suggest that high workload approach and landing phases are conducive to communication conflicts, that different interpretations of the same information might lead to conflict, and that operator state could impact communication and collaboration between flight crews and ATC. A specific problem was noted when reporters felt that the affective response of the other party was not appropriate to the situation. Although this study reflects the limitations inherent in ASRS data, it can provide insights into potential problem areas and conflict triggers in NextGen operations. This research will enable us to better predict NextGen aircrew-ATC communication breakdowns and conflicts resulting from specific situations or operator states. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Archival data were analyzed for 300 Canadian pilot candidates who attempted entry-level military pilot training and 150 candidates who completed intermediate-level training on fixed-wing aircraft. Cognitive ability predicted aviation-related job knowledge but not flying performance at either early or later stages of flying performance. Both previous flying experience and the simulation predicted success in early flying performance but only the simulation predicted success at the more advanced levels of pilot training. Previous flying experience moderated the results from the simulation; the simulation was a much stronger predictor of advanced flying performance for those candidates with no previous flying experience. The results suggest developing different selection protocols for those candidates with previous flying experience. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The measure used in this study was detection performance on the X-Ray Competency Assessment Test (X-Ray CAT) and performance on this measure was obtained on an annual basis. Between tests, screeners performed varying amounts of training in the task of prohibited item detection using an adaptive computer-based training system called X-Ray Tutor (XRT). For both XRT and X-Ray CAT, prohibited items are categorized into guns, knives, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and other prohibited items. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the training and test data were performed. Both types of analysis revealed a strong improvement of X-Ray CAT performance as a result of XRT training for all 4 item categories. The results of the study indicate that screener competency in detecting prohibited items in x-ray images of passenger bags can be greatly improved through routine XRT training. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

A stepwise (for logistic regression and discriminant analysis) and sensitivity (for neural networks) selection procedure identified spatial visualization, eye-hand-foot coordination, and concentration capacity as significant predictors. Performance on the first few flights of the screening program was also retained as a significant predictor of final score. Regarding the accuracy of predictions, logistic regression showed the highest accuracy (77%), with high sensitivity (92%) but low specificity (31%). Discriminant analysis had high sensitivity (77%) and high specificity (64%). However, it had the second lowest accuracy (74%). The best performing neural network type was the multiple layer perception, which showed high sensitivity (85%), the second highest specificity (47%), and high accuracy (76%). Radial basis networks and probabilistic networks both fail to predict correctly the candidates who fail on the flight screening program (0% specificity). © 2013 Copyright 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Three ADI display formats were examined: (a) conventional MH; (b) perspective-view aircraft symbol (PAS), which replaced the conventional miniature aircraft symbol with a pictorial moving aircraft symbol; and (c) command, which presented the appropriate direction for recovery using the pitch or roll arrow. Twenty-two participants (10 unmanned aircraft operators, 12 nonoperators) performed a series of trials in a low-fidelity ADI simulator in which they attempted to recover from a series of unusual attitudes. The results revealed that the combination effect differed according to display format. The command display expedited initiation of the roll input regardless of reference frame. The conventional display showed better performance in the MA reference frame. The PAS display improved the total recovery time and pitch input time of nonoperator participants in the MA reference frame. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

These concepts allocated responsibility for conflict detection and resolution to either pilots, air traffic controllers, or an automated, ground-based, conflict detection and resolution agent. Probe queries were developed to fit in 1 of 3 categories: traffic conflicts, aircraft or airspace status, or commands and communications. We determined that pilot situation awareness of conflict information was highest when the pilot was responsible for separation assurance; workload was minimally affected. Moreover, the changes in pilot awareness of task-specific information can be determined using this online probe technique. Evidence for the reliability and validity of our probe technique is also provided. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2012,United States,Pilots as Weather Briefers: The Direct Use of Aviation Weather Products by General Aviation Pilots,"<title>Pilots as Weather Briefers: The Direct Use of Aviation Weather Products by General Aviation Pilots</title> <abstract>When planning a flight, pilots have traditionally consulted with trained weather briefers who gather, select, review, and to some extent interpret aviation weather products for them. Today, pilots can directly access these same weather products from their own computers, aircraft cockpits, and mobile devices, and choose to skip the services offered by weather briefers. A sample of 191 general aviation pilots completed a survey designed to determine how frequently they directly access weather products, how frequently they still consult with weather briefers, and which weather products pilots use and why. We identified a subset of surveyed pilots who usually or always rely solely on directly accessed weather products (approximately 25%). Although these self-briefing pilots trend toward holding higher grades of pilot certificates and make greater use of cockpit weather systems, they do not differ from other pilots in the weather products they review, and they prefer simple weather observations to more complex forecasts and descriptions of larger weather systems such as fronts and pressure regions. We explore the reasons why self-briefing pilots choose to review the products they do, and how the next generation of pilots might best be trained and supported. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The objective of this research was to investigate techniques for measuring subjective perceptions of clutter and to model the predicted impacts of clutter on pilot performance within the context of advanced flight deck technologies. Six commercial pilots flew simulated approaches under varied workload conditions with low-, medium-, and high-clutter head-up displays, rating the perceived clutter and subjective mental workload associated with each display configuration. Results revealed that high-clutter displays produced elevated reports of perceived clutter and workload due to information density or redundancy, whereas low-clutter displays were perceived as less cluttered but challenging to use due to lack of relevant information typically used during flight. A multidimensional measure of clutter was found to be more sensitive to display differences than an overall perceived rating of clutter, and low-level visual display properties were successful in predicting clutter perceptions and pilot performance. Finalized products of this research could support optimized display design through the identification of clutter thresholds and the implementation of clutter alerts, decluttering mechanisms, or both, and could be used to support display certification and acquisitions processes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2012,United States,An Accessible Cognitive Modeling Tool for Evaluation of Pilot-Automation Interaction,"<title>An Accessible Cognitive Modeling Tool for Evaluation of Pilot-Automation Interaction</title> <abstract>Various cognitive modeling techniques and tools have been developed to support description and prediction of human behavior in complex systems. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules) modeling methods have been used in human-computer interaction (HCI) analysis for many years and are considered easy to learn. GOMS has several limitations, including representing only expert behavior in tasks and not supporting detailed modeling of visual and motor operations or parallel processing. Another limitation is that operation time estimates are deterministic. This research developed an enhanced GOMS language and computational cognitive modeling tool to address the existing GOMS limitations to aid cockpit automation designers in assessing the potential for automation-induced pilot performance problems. Output of the tool for a specific flight and automation use scenario was compared with experiment data for validation purposes. Results demonstrated significant correlations of model-based pilot performance and cognitive workload predictions with observations on pilots using a flight simulator. The new enhanced cognitive modeling approach is expected to provide accurate explanations and predictions of user behaviors during the design of complex systems and interfaces in various domains involving interactive task performance. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The aim of the training was to enhance the participants' awareness of the cognitive processes that they used in a given situation, and to strengthen reflective processes. Cadets were assigned to a training group or to a control group. In-flight performance, stress-management mode, anxiety, and mood were measured. A significant pre- to posttraining improvement in in-flight performance was observed for the lowest ranked cadets in the training group. Anxiety and mood scores did not differ significantly between the training and control groups. However, trained cadets reported changing their stress-management mode. On the whole, these results indicate that cognitive-adaptation training of the type used in this study can enhance both cognitive and emotional adaptation skills. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Three moderator variables were investigated: experiment design, task type, and subjects' experience. Due to the large heterogeneity of the included experiments, we used a random-effects model. Correction for measurement error was applied. The results revealed an overall transfer effect in favor of motion (d = 0.51). Effects were weaker in true transfer (d = 0.10) than in quasi-transfer with different (d = 0.73) and identical (d = 1.19) motion, stronger for helicopter (d = 0.86) and disturbance tasks (d = 0.84) than for maneuvering fixed-wing aircraft (d = 0.07), and stronger for subjects without flight experience (d = 1.57) than for pilots with intermediate (d = 0.53) and expert (d = -0.01) experience. In conclusion, motion seems important for flight-naive individuals learning tasks with external disturbances or control of vehicles with low dynamic stability, but not for experts learning fixed-wing aircraft maneuvering tasks. Effects are attenuated in true transfer as compared to quasi-transfer. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Based on a survey with a sample of 182 Korean Air pilots, the results show that a perceived leader's trust in a subordinate is positively related to the subordinate's trust in that leader, and that a subordinate's trust in his or her leader mediates the relationship between the leader's trust in subordinate and the subordinate's trust in the organization. A summary of the contributions and implications of this research are discussed, as are suggestions for future research. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

An SBT intervention instructed pilots in the knowledge and skills necessary for parachute use. The control condition training was a combination of lecture and computer-based training. After training, participants performed emergency scenarios in a flight training device. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that participants in the SBT performed significantly better than did participants in the control condition on several performance measures. Although additional research is needed, these results likely indicate that SBT is an effective method for training emergency parachute use. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The researcher used regression analysis of student training records to see whether the amount of time a student needed to solo could predict the time needed to earn a private pilot license or the ability to pass the private pilot checkride on the first try. Results showed a strong relationship to the time needed to earn the certificate, but not to checkride results.

2012,Greece,Refresher Training for Air Traffic Controllers: Is It Adequate to Meet the Challenges of Emergencies and Abnormal Situations?,"<title>Refresher Training for Air Traffic Controllers: Is It Adequate to Meet the Challenges of Emergencies and Abnormal Situations?</title> <abstract>An observational field study was carried out to examine the degree that refresher training in air traffic control can account for the demands of real-world emergencies. The refresher-training exercises of 21 teams of en route controllers were observed and a number of real incidents were analyzed at a major European Area Control Centre. Expert controllers were observed handling 53 simulated emergencies and abnormal situations during their annual refresher training and their companion team resource management course. The training curriculum was found to be technically oriented. Responding to emergencies was practiced in scenarios less representative of real situations where the controllers do their job in the context of many interruptions, flight crew deviations, and unrecovered errors. Results indicated a substantial gap between formal training requirements and operational demands. An advanced safety training course is proposed on the basis of cognitive task analysis to increase the cognitive fidelity of simulations and focus on cultivating taskwork and teamwork skills. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

In item response theory the measurement precision of a test score can be evaluated by its degree of information. We investigated whether the maximum of test information corresponded to the cutoff zone for 10 cognitive ability tests of the current French civil air transport pilot selection (n = 577). An item response theory model was fitted to the data. The 6 adequately fitted tests' test information curves were generally maximal in the cutoff score zone. Several ways to improve the absolute level of precision of tests in pilot selection situations are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

In a scenario, SA was hampered by introducing a system malfunction in the form of a fuel leak that resulted in a fuel imbalance. Twelve airline pilots participated in the experiment. An eye tracker was used to track the pilot's visual scanning behavior across the areas of interest (AoIs) in the cockpit. Differences in attentional focus and scanning entropy were observed when the crews searched for the malfunction. The results provided insight into the use of fixation rates and dwell times as information acquisition indicators (Level 1 SA), and the use of entropy as an indicator of new information acquisition activities (Level 3 SA). These findings contribute to the further development and exploration of eye movement analyses as an objective indicator of SA in a civil aviation cockpit setting. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2012,New Zealand,Effects of Pilot Experience on Recall of Information From Graphical Weather Displays,"<title>Effects of Pilot Experience on Recall of Information From Graphical Weather Displays</title> <abstract>Good weather-related decision making is critical for the safe conduct of general aviation flights. A number of tools have been developed in recent years to help pilots visualize the actual and forecast weather for their planned flight. In this study we compare the effectiveness of a graphic weather visualization tool designed for preflight decision making with conventional coded reports and plain English translations. Qualified pilots from several aero clubs were asked to view 4 hypothetical cross-country flights. Departure and destination weather reports (METARs) were provided for each flight in 1 of 4 formats-code, plain English, graphic, or both graphic and plain English. Following a short interference task, the pilots were asked to recall as much of the weather information as possible. Results showed that pilots correctly recalled most information from the dual graphic and plain English display but this was largely attributable to the additional time required to process the 2 displays. Although the formats were rated as equally interpretable, experienced pilots were able to recall much more from the traditional coded METARs than less experienced pilots. Implications for the design and acceptance of novel display formats of meteorological information for pilots are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

This study applied the job demands-resources model to explore burnout and work engagement among cabin crew and investigate the possible antecedents and consequences, using a sample of 305 Taiwanese flight attendants. The health problems caused by heavy workloads under specific working environments and significant rates of turnover intention were noted. Using structural equation modeling to test the conceptual model, the results reveal that job demands positively relate to burnout, whereas job resources positively relate to work engagement but negatively relate to burnout. In addition, health problems directly induce turnover intention and mediate the relationship between burnout and turnover intention. Elevating the levels of work engagement might be effective in reducing cabin crew's turnover intention. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

However, a variable error measure has worked well as a performance measure in highway driving. Twenty novice participants were recruited to participate in a study that tested flying performance in a simulator criterion trial following simulated flight training. The data were analyzed first using a common root mean square error measure (combined error). The same data were subsequently analyzed using a variable error measure and the results were compared and contrasted. Results indicated that the variable error approach was sensitive, precise, and efficient when measuring pilot performance. Explanations for why this is a particularly suitable approach in an aviation context are provided. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Fourteen controllers were asked to judge the risk of conflict for aircraft pairs varying in geometry and vertical separation. A cluster analysis revealed individual differences in how judgments of conflict risk changed with increased vertical separation. There were no individual differences in conflict risk judgments when vertical separation was 0 ft. However, as vertical separation increased to 2,000 ft and 4,000 ft, some controllers made progressively lower judgments of conflict risk than others. These findings have implications for the design of automation tools and for training. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The complementary information distribution is intended to foster a complementary mental model that promotes each team member's access to information according to his or her immediate tasks. The hypothesis-that the complementary information distribution would improve performance and team interaction-was tested in a high-fidelity military helicopter flight simulator with 20 Army aviators. The complementary information distribution was found to have no effect or a positive effect (and no negative effects) on measures of individual's task performance and error rates, with greater positive effects on most measures in off-nominal compared to nominal flight conditions. In addition, measures of team communication and awareness of fellow crewmembers' information needs and workload also found only no effect or positive effects with a complementary information distribution. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2011,Ireland,Assessing the effectiveness of bridge resource management training,"<title>Assessing the effectiveness of bridge resource management training</title> <abstract>Bridge resource management (BRM) is the maritime equivalent of crew resource management (CRM), and has been used in the civilian maritime industry for over a decade. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the U.S. Navy's BRM training was carried out by assessing the attitudes toward, and knowledge of, the human factors that contribute to accidents in high-risk organizations. A comparison was made between surface warfare officers (SWOs) who had and had not attended BRM training. The responses of the SWOs were also compared to CRM-trained U.S. Naval aviators. It was found that BRM training did not have a significant effect on the attitudes and knowledge of SWOs. Further, naval aviators were significantly more knowledgeable, and generally held attitudes toward the human factors that are causal to accidents in high-risk organizations than did SWOs. It was concluded that the Navy's BRM training is not having the impact on knowledge and attitudes that is typical of the CRM training reported in the literature. It is proposed that the main reason for the lack of effectiveness of the BRM program is that the content of the training was not based on a needs assessment carried out within the surface warfare community.</abstract>"

2011,United States,Hazardous events and accident involvement by military and civilian pilots,"<title>Hazardous events and accident involvement by military and civilian pilots</title> <abstract>The Hazardous Events Scale (HES), a measure of involvement in potentially dangerous situations in aviation that do not lead to accidents, has been used as a surrogate for actual accident involvement in studies of risk taking and hazardous attitudes. However, no correlation between the HES and actual accident involvement has previously been published. In this research effort we developed an Army-specific version of the HES and administered it, over the course of 4 separate surveys, to a large sample of U.S. Army aviators. We then computed Army-HES scores that we correlated with self-reported accident involvement. We also reanalyzed data from 4 separate civilian studies in which the civilian version of the HES was administered to compute a correlation between HES and self-reported accident involvement. We hypothesized that a positive correlation would be obtained between the HES and accident involvement. That hypothesis was supported by the results. Positive, significant correlations were obtained for the Army sample (r = .15), and each of the 4 civilian studies (r = .23, r = .32, r = .24, r = .30) between the HES and self-reported accident involvement. The use of the HES as a surrogate measure for accident involvement and indicator of pilot accident risk for both individual pilots and organizations is discussed. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Their confidence levels on SA were also elicited to derive overconfidence scores. The pilots had the lowest accuracy and highest overconfidence in their answers to prediction questions (Level 3 SA). The cognitive abilities associated with prediction were different from those associated with the lower levels of SA, in which a math aptitude (reasoning) test was highly associated with prediction. Through regression analysis, we found that both prediction and overconfidence bias were significant predictors of pilots' performance measured by mission survivability.</abstract>"

A trajectory planned prior to takeoff, might, however, require in-flight revision. To support the flight crew in their task of accurately replanning a flight plan up to a metering fix, in 4 dimensions, a dedicated planning interface has been designed, adopting a cognitive systems engineering approach. The interface allows direct manipulation of the ground track and the descent profile. Constraints on trajectory planning are mapped onto alternative waypoint locations, highlighting the possibilities for acceptable ground track geometry in the horizontal situation display. In the vertical situation display, these constraints are mapped onto candidate top- and bottom-of-descent locations. It is hypothesized that the designed interface enables pilots to efficiently plan suitable 4D trajectories, while allowing for adaptive behavior and supporting situation awareness, even under high workload conditions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Many proposed schemes include shifting the task of maintaining safe distances between aircraft to ground-based automation and assigning air traffic controllers a supervisory role. This research investigated air traffic controller performance using advanced ATM concepts for the task of conflict resolution. Performance using a medium fidelity air traffic control simulator was investigated across 2 proportions of free-flying traffic and 3 types of decision support. Conflict resolution performance was significantly degraded when free-flying aircraft failed to negotiate a conflict and controllers had to intervene. Conflict resolution performance varied across the aiding condition and was superior when negotiation information was provided. However we did not find any differences in performance across proportions of free-flying traffic.

To explore how directive leadership is manifested in military helicopter cockpits, communications of 52 military pilots, flying a realistic simulator scenario in crews of 2, were analyzed. Based on information from general leadership research and theory, we focused the analyses on flight experience and organization goals. Pilots were assigned to 3 different groups, based on their experience level. Transcripts of communications from 3 portions of the flight were analyzed: from take-off to the first problem; from identification of the first problem to its solution and; from the discovery of the second problem to its solution. Analysis of variance showed there were no significant differences in commands given by the aircraft commanders in all 3 segments despite the experience level of the second pilot. There were significant differences in the commands given by the second pilot to the aircraft commander based on experience level and organizational goals. Although aircraft commanders were equally directive with their second pilots, no matter what their experience levels, during problem solving, they differed in their approach to the problems depending on the second pilot's experience. We discuss these findings and suggest application to both training and additional research. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The initial study served to assess and refine a method for evoking RA events in an interactive and realistic air traffic control setting. Using this method, an experiment was conducted to systematically assess the operational impact of RA downlink on the controller. The experiment provided evidence for operational benefits, namely a lower number of contradictory clearances to aircraft involved in an RA and a better recollection of RA events caused by pilot or controller error. Furthermore, there was no evidence for negative effects of RA downlink, such as cognitive tunneling on the RA event. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The interface coupled the pilots' actions and the consequences of these actions for the overall replanning goals through a visual display of the flight plan's temporal and spatial layout, as well as the temporal and spatial constraints on altering the flight plan. Three levels of interface information detail were tested for 2 scenarios with different levels of complexity of the flight plan and the changes required. It was found that the medium- and high-detail interfaces are faster, are easier to use, provide better task performance, and are preferred by the pilots participating in the experiment. The expected advantage of visualizing the spatial and temporal constraints on the interface through elliptical affordance zones did not result in a better performance, lower click count, or higher appreciation than the medium-level interface. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Results revealed that ATCs' response sequences frequently included ordered end subsequences of 2 to 6 items. These end subsequences were recalled as an initial run at a similar rate in both modalities, although they occurred more frequently in positions other than initial recall positions in the auditory modality. These results replicate and extend those reported in controlled laboratory studies, and this is despite ATCs' extended experience with processing visual information. The results are discussed in terms of the functional limitations of visual and auditory item processing and their relevance to air traffic control activities, training, and selection. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2010,United States,Field of view effects on pilot performance in flight,"<title>Field of view effects on pilot performance in flight</title> <abstract>For flight training, head-worn displays represent low-cost, wide field of regard, deployable systems when compared to traditional simulation facilities. However, current head-worn systems provide limited effective fields of view. Wide field of view alternatives promise to increase transfer of training effectiveness through enhanced situation awareness. To test this proposition, this experiment manipulated the pilot's effective field of view and examined subsequent flight performance, which was measured primarily by runway alignment error and vertical track error. Results indicated a significant and quantifiable change in visual scan pattern, head movement, and flight control performance as the effective field of view was sequentially decreased. As field of view decreased, the average visual scan pattern changed to focus less out the window and more on the instruments inside the cockpit. The head range of movement significantly increased below an 80° horizontal × 54° vertical effective field of view as well as significantly decreasing runway alignment and vertical track performance, which occurred below 120° horizontal × 81° vertical effective field of view. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

We evaluated the effects and interactions of 2 levels of terrain portrayal, guidance symbology, and flight control response type on pilot performance during the conduct of a relatively complex instrument approach procedure. The terrain and guidance presentations were evaluated as elements of an integrated primary flight display system. The approach procedure used in the study included a steeply descending, curved segment as might be encountered in emerging, required-navigation-performance-based procedures. Pilot performance measures consisted of flight technical performance, perceived workload, perceived situational awareness, and subjective preference. The results revealed that an elevation-based generic terrain portrayal significantly improved perceived situation awareness without adversely affecting flight technical performance or workload. Other factors (pilot instrument rating, control response type, and guidance symbology) were not found to significantly affect the performance measures. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Before operational use, however, concerns were raised about the low scores of incumbent ATCS personnel (who participated in the initial research) and score differences between groups, which could result in adverse impact (possible unfair discrimination). To address these concerns, the subscores of the AT-SAT were reweighted and the constant was changed to yield a new total score. This study found that the new weighting formula has benefited all groups and is likely to reduce the potential of adverse impact. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Vigilance was assessed 6 times and learning 4 times, both in a computerized environment. Motivation, mood, and sleepiness were monitored using self-ratings. In the vigilance test, sleep deprivation decreased the amount of correct detections and increased reaction times in both groups. Furthermore, the number of false alarms increased in the placebo group.

Data collected at 5 U.S. and 1 foreign repair stations disclosed a number of opportunities for errors arising from the more complex interactions among the repair station, the airline customers, and the regulatory authority. Two quantitative studies gathered data to test for 1 expected problem: that of using multiple formats of procedure document. First, a repair station error database was analyzed and concluded that ""information"" (e.g., documentation) was a significant causal factor associated with specific error types. Second, although repair stations must switch frequently between the documentation systems of different airlines, a task card comprehension study did not find increased error rates from changing document formats. With 54 licensed mechanics, well-designed procedure documentation greatly reduced comprehension errors. Improved documentation by following human factors good practice is recommended as a strategy to mitigate error potential for the repair stations where work is outsourced. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2010,United Kingdom,Auditory alerts: An intelligent alert presentation system for civil aircraft,"<title>Auditory alerts: An intelligent alert presentation system for civil aircraft</title> <abstract>The principal role of the auditory interface on civil aircraft is to inform pilots of dangerous or potentially dangerous system states. Efficient alerts provide information that is uniquely identifiable with one aspect of the aircraft's behavior and do not form a nuisance by being too intrusive and overly persistent. It is known that excessive auditory alert intensity can impair human performance; however, simply lowering alert intensity is not sufficient because there is a need to ensure detection and safety are not compromised. In an attempt to address this problem, an automated alert system, the Intelligent Alert Presentation system, was constructed. The system analyzes flight deck noise in real time, and alerts are then presented at a fixed ratio above the noise (+10 dBA). The system has alert muting capabilities that can be activated following detection. The intensity is attenuated to -5 dBA below the noise level, where the signal is partially masked but remains detectable and comprehensive, according to the findings of 2 experiments reported here. It is suggested that this would provide the pilot with a more suitable environment for carrying out higher order cognitive, more demanding tasks. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

In this study, expert judges indicated the items on the checklist that were referenced in briefings from 5 terminal radar approach controls. Briefings were short and routinely included information on only a subset of checklist items, often only traffic, and often in an order not consistent with the checklist. We explored different models to explain the PRB structure and the partial, unordered use of the checklist. We propose a working model of air traffic control shift change that assumes that controllers convey information from memory and only sometimes use the physical checklist to conduct the briefing. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Data were collected from 544 South African and 1,064 Australian aircraft pilots and analyzed by means of various analytical procedures. To establish the intercultural equivalence of the AGAQ, multivariate methods for item analysis and the comparison of factor structures were used. This included analysis of variance, exploratory factor analysis, Procrustean rotation, and the application of single- and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. The item-level statistics revealed acceptable item discrimination values, satisfactory item and scale reliabilities, and the absence of item bias for the AGAQ across the 2 cultures. The scale-level statistics confirmed the equivalence of the AGAQ scales for both samples in the aviation contexts. It was unequivocally established that the AGAQ is a valid and culturally nonbiased measure that can be used to assess South African and Australian aviators’ perceptions of gender- related pilot behavior. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Ocular scan patterns were obtained by magnetic head tracking and infrared eye tracking. Flying errors peaked after about 24 to 28 hr of continuous wakefulness in line with peaks in subjective fatigue and EEG theta activity, and they were not directly attributable to degradation of instrument scanning, which was very consistent across pilots and largely unaffected by the sleep deprivation. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,Netherlands,Predicting pilot task demand load during final approach,"<title>Predicting pilot task demand load during final approach</title> <abstract>This research aims at developing a method to assess the safety of airport approaches from the perspective of airline pilots. The main hypothesis is that safety is inversely proportional to the task demand load (TDL) experienced by the pilots conducting it. The TDL is the mental workload imposed by the system to be controlled, and is not to be mistaken for the mental workload experienced by the operator, referred to as mental load. This article presents the results of preliminary research that focused on how some of the environmental factors that determine the approach, such as the type of aircraft and the meteorological conditions, affect the TDL. A paper pilot model, consisting of a scanning model, mental model, and control model, was used to quantify how hard an average pilot has to work to conduct the specified approach. Offline computer simulations with this model revealed some clear trends in pilot scanning rate, task error, and control activity, as a function of the environmental factors, which will eventually allow for a prediction and quantification of the TDL. Depending on the approach performance requirements on the one hand, and the pilot scanning capacity on the other, increasing turbulence intensity showed a change in trend for all TDL-related parameters at a particular turbulence intensity. Results from a pilot- in-the-loop evaluation, conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator, supported the main trends of the offline simulation trials. They also indicated that through adopting different scanning strategies, pilots can leverage their workload; more research is necessary to clarify this result, however. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,Pakistan - Sweden,Mental workload in aircraft and simulator during basic civil aviation training,"<title>Mental workload in aircraft and simulator during basic civil aviation training</title> <abstract>This study investigated mental workload in basic civil aviation training. Heart rate, eye movement, and subjective ratings from 11 students were collected during simulator and aircraft sessions. Results show high correspondence in psychophysiological reactions between the sessions. For some flight segments, heart rate was consistently lower in the simulator, suggesting higher mental workload in the aircraft. Differences in heart rate during rejected takeoff and engine failure indicate that the increase of workload starts in advance of an “unexpected” event in the simulator where it seems to be of preparatory nature, whereas in the aircraft it is more connected to management of the situation. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,Netherlands - United States,Pilot support interface for three-degree decelerating approach procedures,"<title>Pilot support interface for three-degree decelerating approach procedures</title> <abstract>Previous research on aircraft noise abatement has resulted in some promising flight procedures to mitigate noise impact, such as the three-degree decelerating approach (TDDA). A problem with decelerating approaches, however, is that they typically lead to increased spacing, which in turn results in a significant reduction of runway landing capacity. A possible solution to this problem might be to delegate the task of separating the aircraft during the approach to the pilot. To aid the pilot, an algorithm has been developed that predicts the trajectory of the preceding aircraft and optimizes the flap schedule based on this prediction. Offline simulations indicate that using this system runway throughput numbers of up to 98% of the capacity of a conventional instrument landing system (ILS) approach can be achieved (Ren & Clarke, 2003). To assess practical implementation issues and to investigate pilot appreciation, a piloted experiment was conducted, for which a pilot support interface has been developed that presents the future separation information in an intuitive fashion. The experiment showed that it is indeed possible for pilots to perform the spacing task while flying a TDDA. The pilot support interface significantly reduces pilot workload when compared to a baseline display. Also the effects of off-nominal lead pilot behavior on pilot performance are reduced by the use of online flap schedule optimization and separation prediction. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Toward these ends, we conducted 2 studies using recommendations from National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations and two joint Federal Aviation Administration and industry working groups. The goal of these studies was to identify the types of interventions commonly recommended by these agencies, as well as to develop a framework for evaluating the potential impact of specific safety initiatives that target human error in aviation.

Therefore, we propose a framework called the Human Factors Intervention Matrix as a potential tool for evaluating current aviation safety programs, as well as generating more comprehensive interventions in the future. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Certified flight instructors were surveyed regarding the weather training they provide to primary student pilots. Participants typically report spending 10 to 12 hr on weather instruction with their primary students. Instrument instructors (CFIIs) report placing significantly greater emphasis on 17 of 34 weather topics when instructing primary student pilots than instructors who are only rated to instruct primary student pilots (CFIs). Similarly, participants who instruct under FAR Part 141 or in academic settings state that they place significantly more emphasis on almost all of the weather topics than those participants who only instruct under FAR Part 61. Generally, all participants report that their own mastery of weather content is significantly better than the quality of the instruction they provide on that content to primary student pilots.

In the first study, qualified pilots, student pilots, and geography students were presented with weather-related scenarios, and rated the risk involved in each scenario. There was no relationship between flight experience and the CWS scores. The 3 groups of participants did not significantly differ in their CWS scores, although the qualified pilots were the most discriminating, and the geography students were the most consistent. To decrease reliance on memory, the CWS procedure was modified to involve a blocking task and a second study was carried out with qualified pilots. In contrast to Study 1, there was a relationship between flight experience and the CWS scores, suggesting that the adapted CWS procedure was a more valid measure of expertise in weather-related risk perception than the CWS task used in Study 1. The CWS procedure could be a useful tool in assessing expertise in aeronautical judgment and decision making. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The data we present herein are a synthesis of prior work and may be useful for consideration by SVS designers and certification entities. Pilots flew off-path tasks, following the middle of a curved valley depicted on the SVS. The SVS parameters were manipulated between runs and cross-track deviations from the desired path following the middle of the valley were recorded. Off-path terrain navigation tasks were used to isolate the effect of the different SVS terrain depictions on cross-track error without the overriding effects of other flight guidance symbology. For off-path SVS operations and based on the results presented in this article, we recommend an SVS head-down display resolution of about 105 pixels per inch (ppi; 32.7 pixels per degree of visual angle) or better at a viewing distance of 21 in., a field of regard of 60 degrees, a terrain data density of 6 arc sec or better, a two-color checkerboard or elevation-based coloring scheme (or a combination thereof), and Gouraud shading of the texture. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"
2009,Germany,Combining enhanced and synthetic vision for autonomous all-weather approach and landing,"<title>Combining enhanced and synthetic vision for autonomous all-weather approach and landing</title> <abstract>This article is about the design and evaluation of the human-machine interface of an enhanced and synthetic vision system. Several tunnel-in-the-sky and pathway-in-the-sky concepts including scene-linking elements have been evaluated. Pathway-in-the-sky displays enable pilots to accurately fly difficult trajectories. However, these displays may drive pilots' attention to the aircraft guidance task at the expense of other tasks, particularly when the pathway display is located head-down. A pathway head-up display (HUD) might be a viable solution to overcome this disadvantage. Moreover, the pathway might mitigate the perceptual segregation between the static near domain and the dynamic far domain and hence might improve attention switching between both sources. To more comprehensively overcome the perceptual near-to-far domain disconnect, alphanumeric symbols could be attached to the pathway leading to an HUD design concept called scene linking. A scene-linked pathway-predictor concept was implemented on a monocular retinal scanning head-mounted device (HMD) in combination with an optical head tracker. The evaluation comprises low-fidelity part-task simulations, high-fidelity simulator runs, and flight trials. Where laboratory experiments found evidence in favor of scene-linked pathway HUDs or HMDs, the real flight tests could not fully support this display concept. Even so, in all studies evidence has been found that the head-up pathway concept could be superior to current head-up solutions. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

Recovery was done in a control condition, aided by a heads-up display (HUD) only, and with 3 command display augmentations: (a) a command visual icon, pointing in the direction of appropriate control; (b) the icon augmented with a voice command; and (c) the icon augmented with a tactile command. All 3 command displays reduced the time to make the initial recovery response relative to the control condition, and decreased the frequency of initial incorrect roll responses.

This study examined the influence of format (i.e., headings and story structure) on memory for aviation occurrence briefs. In accordance with Seifert et al.'s (1994) predictive features model, it was hypothesized that participants who read occurrence briefs written in a predictive format (i.e., emphasizing the complication feature in heading and story layout) would have better memory for the briefs than participants who read briefs written in a standard format (i.e., similar to traditional occurrence briefs that emphasize setting and outcome features). Thirty-two nonpilot participants read either a predictive or a standard magazine reporting 5 occurrence briefs. Participants evaluated the magazines and completed a sentence recognition test. Although the magazines received similar evaluations, participants who read the predictive briefs had significantly higher recognition scores, but significantly lower confidence levels, than participants who read the standard briefs. These results suggest that occurrence briefs should be presented in a predictive format to enhance memory for reports. Copyright © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

The 3 main staffing positions in the tower, flight-data/clearance delivery (FD/CD), ground control (GC), and local control (LC), were observed by subject-matter experts at 10 control towers. Frequency of occurrence, importance ratings, and type of paper used were recorded. In addition, perceived benefits of marks made on the paper were assessed using open item responses and a series of Likert-scale questions. The positions varied in the marks the controllers made and in their reasons for making the marks. FD/CD controllers tended to make marks because they reduced workload or aided communication. LC tended to make marks because they aided memory, organization, and situation awareness. GC proved to be an interesting hybrid of the FD/CD and LC.

2008,United States,Designing external aids that support older pilots' communication,"<title>Designing external aids that support older pilots' communication</title> <abstract>Voice communication with air traffic control (ATC) taxes pilots' cognitive abilities, contributing to errors that reduce safety. External aids such as note-taking help pilots manage communication demands, and may especially benefit older pilots. Emerging technologies provide new opportunities for external aids that are integrated with other systems. We compared an electronic notepad (epad) positioned next to the instrument panel of a flight simulator to conventional note-taking (kneepad) on a read-back task. In Experiment 1, 6 older and 6 younger instrument-rated pilots listened to and read back ATC messages while using the epad, kneepad, or no aid. Epad use in this communication-only condition was compared to a condition in which pilots used the epad to support communication while flying the simulator. Read-back accuracy was higher when pilots used either aid compared to no aid, and the pattern of results suggested a smaller age difference with either aid than in the no-aid condition. Accuracy supported by the epad was not reduced in the multitask condition, suggesting the epad would support communication during flight. In Experiment 2, 12 younger and 12 older pilots performed the same tasks, with a modified epad interface. Further evidence was found for smaller age differences when communication was supported by either aid. The results replicate note-taking benefits for older pilots' communication (Morrow et al., 2003) and extend this finding to the novel epad.</abstract>"
2008,Norfolk Island - United States,Pilot weather assessment: Implications for visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions,"<title>Pilot weather assessment: Implications for visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions</title> <abstract>Visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) account for over 10% of the fatalities in general aviation. Evidence suggests that pilots' assessments of weather conditions are related to their decision to continue. This study investigated pilots' ability to assess ceiling and visibility in a flight simulator. Assessment accuracy did not differ between instrument- and non-instrument-rated pilots for ceiling accuracy, but visibility accuracy was better for non-instrument-rated pilots. The data indicated pilots allowed their estimates of ceiling and visibility to influence each other. That is, pilots tended to judge a ceiling to be higher than it actually was when it was paired with a high visibility. This interaction may play a significant role in pilots' decisions to continue into IMC.</abstract>"

In this study, a short ADM training course was constructed around 2 mnemonic methods, SHOR and DESIDE. A total of 41 pilots from the Republic of China Tactical Training Wing participated: Half received a short ADM training course and half did not. Their decision-making skill was evaluated during a series of emergency situations presented in a full-flight simulator on the dimensions of situation assessment, risk management, and response time. As a result of the training, significant improvements were noted in the quality of pilots' situation assessment and risk management, but this was usually at the expense of response speed. The results do strongly suggest, though, that ADM is trainable and is demonstrably effective in improving decision making.</abstract>"
2008,United States,Using relative position and temporal judgments to identify biases in spatial awareness for synthetic vision systems,"<title>Using relative position and temporal judgments to identify biases in spatial awareness for synthetic vision systems</title> <abstract>Synthetic vision systems (SVS) are cockpit displays that depict terrain ahead of ownship to prevent controlled flight into terrain. This work investigated how spatial biases manifest themselves in SVS displays. Eighteen pilots made spatial judgments (relative angle, distance, height, and abeam time) regarding the location of terrain points displayed in 112 5-sec videos of SVS displays. Judgment error characterized spatial biases related to between-map scale differences in geometric field of view, within-map differences in distance, within-map differences in orientation, the virtual space effect, the filled distance effect, and time. Recommendations for future experimentation and modeling are made.</abstract>"
2008,Australia,Time-to-contact perception during simulated night landing,"<title>Time-to-contact perception during simulated night landing</title> <abstract>In 2 experiments, nonpilots made time-to-contact (TTC) judgments during simulated oblique descents toward a ground-plane. Experiment 1 revealed a significant effect of simulated glideslope on TTC judgments: 3-degree simulations were underestimated, 6-degree simulations were generally accurate, and 9-degree simulations were overestimated. However, there was a significant reduction in this glideslope effect when the simulated aimpoint was explicitly (as opposed to implicitly) identified throughout the display. This glideslope effect was also found to disappear in Experiment 2, when aimpoint distance was held constant for all glideslopes, suggesting that TTC was being indirectly calculated based on perceived distance.</abstract>"
2008,Denmark - Norway,Measuring individual and team situation awareness during planning tasks in training of en route air traffic control,"<title>Measuring individual and team situation awareness during planning tasks in training of en route air traffic control</title> <abstract>The situation awareness (SA) of air traffic controller (ATCO) students, including the temporal aspect of SA, was measured by means of their visual information acquisition during simulator training. The measurements were defined both at an individual level and at a team level. SA and team SA (TSA) were measured by means of eye-movement data: first, the extent to which individual ATCOs focused or distributed their visual attention in the interface; second, the extent to which ATCO teams were actively involved in planning tasks. Planning was measured based on how ATCO teams attended to tactical and strategic monitoring tasks. This enabled process-oriented measurements of SA and TSA that predicted aspects of performance and were sensitive to situational changes. Copyright © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</abstract>"

A survey of pilots and mechanics was conducted to determine how often they were able to discuss discrepancies directly and to identify factors that influenced the detail they provided about discrepancies in the aircraft logbook. Logistical factors such as short turn times between flights and crew schedules appeared to present barriers to face-to-face meetings between pilots and mechanics. Guidelines for pilot logbook entries appeared to be less clearly defined than for mechanic entries. Pilots reported receiving significantly less training on writing logbook entries and spent significantly less time making individual entries than mechanics. Mechanics indicated greater concern about the Federal Aviation Administration reading their entries than pilots. Mechanics indicated they had little opportunity to follow upwith pilots to clarify a logbook entry once pilots departed the aircraft.</abstract>"

In this article, we present a review of work that focuses on maintenance procedure incident reports conducted over several years at NASA Ames Research Center. Using 3 different exploratory methodologies, we analyzed relevant reports from a database of 1,046 maintenance reports (from 1998-2002) in the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System. Analyses revealed that procedural errors in maintenance take a variety of different forms, involve many different types of documents and can be attributed to both document deficiencies and user errors. The objective of these studies was to better characterize procedural errors in maintenance so that more effective solutions can be devised.</abstract>"

To gain insight into aviation maintenance turnover procedures and possible improvements to them, we examined NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) maintenance incident reports involving shift turnover communication problems. We used the Boeing Maintenance Error Decision Aid (MEDA) coding system to code 1,182 ASRS maintenance incident reports. We compared the incidents involving shift turnover-related communication problems (n = 46) with incidents involving non-turnover-related communication problems (n = 37) and with other maintenance incidents (n = 1,099). Turnover-related incidents involved a significantly higher proportion of equipment that was classified by ASRS as ""critical"" than either of the other 2 samples, and had a significantly higher proportion of severe consequences. We suggest improvements to turnover work practices and include a generic checklist for effective turnovers to aid in turnover development.</abstract>"
2008,Norfolk Island - Thailand - United States,Evaluating the effects of virtual training in an aircraft maintenance task,"<title>Evaluating the effects of virtual training in an aircraft maintenance task</title> <abstract>To provide the public with continuing, safe, and reliable air transportation it is important to have a sound aircraft inspection and maintenance system. To ensure that aircraft maintenance inspectors are adequately trained, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the task of aircraft maintenance inspection. One proven technique for improving inspection performance is the use of training. Due to the nature of aircraft maintenance, inspection is vital in locating damage to the wing, fuselage, aircraft cargo bay, and other components of an aircraft. Because inspection plays such an important part of aircraft maintenance, it is imperative that inspectors are adequately trained and competent to ensure that damage to aircraft does not go unnoticed during routine maintenance. The purpose of this study was to develop a simulated aircraft cargo bay in a virtual reality (VR) environment to explore VR as a training tool and examine differences between general and detailed inspection under paced and unpaced conditions.</abstract>"
2008,United States,Reducing accidents and incidents through control of process,"<title>Reducing accidents and incidents through control of process</title> <abstract>Research has demonstrated that workers in aviation maintenance operations often perceive that safety and operational goals are in conflict. Investigators at Purdue University have worked with numerous aviation companies over the past 11 years to improve safety and control maintenance human errors. During that time, it has become apparent that safety goals, strategies, and programs are differentially supported depending on the operational and economic pressures experienced by an organization. Purdue researchers have often traced operational and performance stressors back to poorly structured operational processes and other factors that result in artificially induced perceptions for the need to sacrifice safety for performance. Several strategies used or developed by Purdue researchers have demonstrated that safety and productivity gains can be simultaneously achieved through the use of process mapping techniques to identify areas in need of improvement. Using these maps as a tool, organizational members have the ability to follow the product through the process and identify safety and productivity challenges. Through iterative use of the technique, dramatic improvements in safety as well as process effectiveness and efficiency have been demonstrated in actual aviation operational settings.</abstract>"

What makes ST-PRA an evolutionary step is that the entire risk model is made up of human errors and at-risk behaviors, attempting to model the as-is state of a predominantly human process. Where traditional PRA will generally model a technical system with some input of human errors (e.g., THERP or WASH 1400; Kanki & Marx, 2004), the ST-PRA attempts to model human errors and human variations, where, given behavioral norms, 1 task can be performed many different ways within 1 risk model.

2008,United States,Video-mediated collaborative engineering support,"<title>Video-mediated collaborative engineering support</title> <abstract>Unanticipated problems in maintenance and engineering frequently require collaborative work involving geographically distributed personnel. Real-time video will permit engineers and technicians to work together to resolve aircraft problems when personnel are based in different locations. The development and acceptance of video-based devices is also a necessary step toward the use of augmented reality systems in maintenance. A series of demonstrations and equipment trials were carried out with devices intended to permit remote collaboration. A comparison of still images and video of a typical maintenance task demonstrated a clear preference for motion imagery over still images. A system was assembled using consumer-level devices and software to enable real-time, remote video-based collaboration on technical issues. The system was readily accepted by maintenance technicians, information technology personnel, and engineers. Video imaging such as this has the potential to be paired with computer-generated graphics to create augmented reality scenes that, in the future, might guide maintenance work.</abstract>"

NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System has been receiving an increasing number of maintenance incident reports since a specialized maintenance reporting form was introduced in 1996. In a series of studies, the database of ASRS maintenance incidents was examined using correspondence analysis, a statistical technique that converts complex data tables into a visual form. The analyses revealed patterns within the ASRS data set that would have otherwise been difficult to detect. The results have implications for a range of purposes including human factors training, the design of procedures, and the identification of improvements in aircraft design.</abstract>"
2007,Sweden,HUD with a velocity (flight-path) vector reduces lateral error during landing in restricted visibility,"<title>HUD with a velocity (flight-path) vector reduces lateral error during landing in restricted visibility</title> <abstract>The operational community has assumed that using a head-up display (HUD) instead of conventional head-down displays will increase accuracy and safety during approach and landing. The putative mechanism for this increase in safety is that previously demonstrated improvements in lateral and vertical control of the aircraft in flight should carry over to the landing situation. Alternatively, it is possible that, during approach and landing, the HUD might affect the pilot's ability to assimilate outside cues at the decision height, thereby reducing the success ratio for landings using an HUD. This article reports a pair of experiments that test these competing hypotheses. Taking advantage of the opportunity when an air transport operator introduced HUD in an existing aircraft fleet, we were able to use a Boeing 737-700 full-motion simulator flown by commercial airline pilots. We explored the effects of (a) HUD use, (b) ambient visibility, and (c) length of approach lighting on the size and location of the touchdown footprint. We also explored the effects of HUD use on approach success ratio. HUD use reduced the width of the touchdown footprint in all tested visibility and lighting conditions, including visibility below the minimum allowed. HUD use had no effect on the length of the touchdown footprint. We could not detect any decrease in approach success rate for HUD approaches. Based on these empirical data, the minimum visibility for approaches using HUDs could be set lower than for approaches without an HUD. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

Well-functioning safety management for minimizing the risk for accidents is vital and dependent on the safety culture. This article reports on a safety culture assessment of a ground handling company using a multiplex approach method. The study is included in the establishment of reference data concerning safety culture aspects in different transport branches. The results of the assessment reveal a generally good existing safety culture. However, the safety culture is somewhat poorer than that estimated and desired by the managers and that in other transport branches. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"
2007,United States,Age-related group and individual differences in aircraft pilot cognition,"<title>Age-related group and individual differences in aircraft pilot cognition</title> <abstract>The effect of age on cognition was examined with a variety of neuropsychological tests in 220 aircraft pilots. The assessment included tests of psychomotor speed, information processing speed, attention and executive ability, verbal learning and memory, and visual learning and memory. Pilot age was between 28 and 62 with a mean age of 48 years. Test performance was regressed on pilot age to determine the function (linear or nonlinear) of age-related differences in cognition. Individual performance was also examined by assessing outlier test scores (> 2 SD) relative to the overall group mean. Age was significantly associated with test performance across several domains; when significant, a linear function best described the association. Pilot age was not associated with immediate verbal recall or recognition or with immediate visual recall. Almost all performance outliers occurred in pilots over 40 years old. Implications of a gradual decline in pilot cognition are discussed as well as the consideration of a subgroup of relatively poor cognitive performing pilots and the potential importance of assessing individual differences.

2007,United States,Measurement of team situation awareness in low experience level aviators,"<title>Measurement of team situation awareness in low experience level aviators</title> <abstract>Two measurement methods for situation awareness were tested on 2-person aircrews and compared for the information they yielded on team situation awareness. Forty-one crews of low experience level military aviators flew 2 different scenarios, 1 in a full-mission simulator, a 1 in a low-fidelity trainer. Team situation awareness was measured by instructor and observers in the high-fidelity simulator scenario and by responses to questions on flight knowledge in a scenario in the low-fidelity trainer. Scores on both measures were found to be reliable. Team situation awareness scores based on flight knowledge collected in the low-fidelity scenario were significantly correlated with team performance in the high-fidelity simulation (r = .41,p<.05). The 2 team situation awareness scores (1 from the high-fidelity simulation and 1 from the low-fidelity simulation) were also significantly correlated (r = .43, p < .05). These findings and related information are discussed in relation to the use of the measurements in situation awareness training for low experience level pilots.

2007,Netherlands,Clothoid-augmented trajectories for perspective flight-path displays,"<title>Clothoid-augmented trajectories for perspective flight-path displays</title> <abstract>Perspective flight-path displays allow pilots to accurately follow complex curved approach trajectories. The current practice to define the tunnel reference trajectory as a concatenation of straight and circular segments, however, leads to difficult transition maneuvers between these segments, strongly contributing to pilot workload. To achieve a smooth interception, clothoid transition paths can be inserted between the straight and circular sections. A clothoid function defines a trajectory curvature that changes from 0 (a straight trajectory) to the desired curvature (the circular trajectory) in a certain amount of space traveled. Because the reference path better matches the natural aircraft response, the clothoid transients are hypothesized to make the task of flying complex curved approaches easier. A pilot-in-the-loop experiment, conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator, confirms this hypothesis and shows that clothoid-augmented trajectories yield improved path-following performance, require fewer pilot control actions, and result in higher comfort levels.

2007,United Kingdom,Crosswind landings in general aviation: A modified method of reporting wind information to the pilot,"<title>Crosswind landings in general aviation: A modified method of reporting wind information to the pilot</title> <abstract>Crosswind conditions are a contributory factor in many general aviation landing incidents and accidents. In an online survey, it was observed that 98% of respondents either failed to or could not accurately calculate the runway crosswind component from air traffic control (ATC) reports passed using the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard phraseology; the majority of pilots also severely underestimated the crosswind strength. Furthermore, nearly 30% of these respondents could not recall or inaccurately recalled the crosswind limit of their aircraft. In a 2nd study using a series of approach and landing trials in a general aviation simulator, wind reports were passed to participants using either the standard ICAO format or in a modified format, where the runway crosswind component was explicitly stated. The results showed that for the group receiving wind reports in the standard format, the mental arithmetic associated with calculating the runway crosswind impaired flying performance. As with the online survey, these calculations were also performed poorly. These results suggest that ATC reports on the approach should be amended to specifically include the runway crosswind component and that all aircraft should have their crosswind limit clearly indicated in the cockpit.

This research examined multiple cognitive workload measures, including secondary task performance and physiological (cardiac) measures, as inputs to a neural network for operator functional state classification during a simulated air traffic control (ATC) task. Twenty-five participants performed a low-fidelity simulation under manual control or 1 of 4 different forms of automation. Traffic volume was either low (3 aircraft) or high (7 aircraft). Participants also performed a secondary (gauge) monitoring task. Results demonstrated significant effects of traffic volume (workload) on aircraft clearances (p < .01) and trajectory conflicts (p < .01), secondary task performance (p < .01), and subjective ratings of task workload (p < .01). The form of ATC automation affected the number of aircraft collisions (p < .05), secondary task performance (p < .01), and heart rate (HR; p < .01). However, heart rate and heart rate variability measures were not sensitive to the traffic manipulation. Neural network models of controller workload (defined in terms of traffic volume) were developed using the secondary task performance and simple heart rate measure as inputs. The best workload classification accuracy using a genetic algorithm (across all forms of ATC automation) was 64%, comparable to prior work. Additional neural network models of workload for each mode of ATC automation revealed substantial variability in predictive accuracy, based on the characteristics of the automation. Secondary task performance was a highly sensitive indicator of ATC workload, whereas the heart rate measure appeared to operate as a more global indicator of workload. A limited range of cardiac response might be sufficient for the demands of the brain in ATC. The results have applicability to design of future adaptive systems integrating neural-network-based workload state classifiers for multiple forms of automation.

The 2 measures were inversely correlated on the 2nd shift half, suggesting a compensatory effect of increased tension on decreased alertness. Task performance was decreased at 7:00, overall in a free recall task, and according to list length (9- vs. 6-item) and presentation modality (visual vs. auditory) in a recognition task. The data suggest that changes in controllers' memory processes with time of day depend on the processing strength induced by task characteristics.

Thirty-six participants were assigned to 1 of 3 training conditions, 2 utilizing identical elements (pilot training and flight dispatcher training) and 1 utilizing general principles. Training effectiveness was measured by participants' scores on operational tasks completed after training. Participants in both identical elements training groups exhibited significantly higher scores on tasks related to their training, suggesting that identical elements benefit job-specific training. The general principles training group performed well on flight dispatcher tasks, but did not perform well on pilot tasks, a result that suggests general principles are beneficial in some situations but may best be utilized in combination with job-specific training.

Automated performance measurement systems may provide assistance to instructors and improve the quality of performance assessment. However, little research is available to guide such interventions or to document their effects. This research compared the ability of flight instructors to give diagnostic ratings of team performance with or without computer assistance using the Enhancing Performance With Improved Coordination (EPIC) tool. It was found that the instructor group operating with EPIC (n = 10) had more differentiated and accurate ratings of team performance compared to the control group (n = 10). These results suggest that approaches such as EPIC can serve to complement and augment instructor capabilities, providing more powerful and diagnostic team performance assessment systems.

Intervention programs for fatigue in any organization should be based on relevant indigenous data. This study was undertaken to develop an understanding of fatigue among aircrew of the Indian Air Force (IAF). This questionnaire study was carried out at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Bangalore, in which a total of 83 military fast jet aircrew participated. The mean age of the respondents was 28.9 years (SD - 3.7) with an average military service of 7.2 years. The majority of the aircrew tended to sleep more in the afternoon and longer in the night on holidays and weekends. One third of the aircrew believed that they could perform in peak efficiency even with 1 to 2 hr sleep loss. A similar number stated that they had felt sleepy or drowsy in the cockpit due to sleep deprivation. Aircrew rated decreased attention, increased reaction time, lapses in concentration, and poor aircraft handling as important outcomes of fatigue. Tea or coffee was the preferred countermeasure. They were unanimous in the felt need for more information dissemination on fatigue. There appears to be complacency among aircrew who believe that they may be able to operate with full efficiency despite 1 to 2 hr of sleep loss. They are not well versed about the beneficial effects of napping when fatigued. More emphasis should be placed on recurrent education of aircrew on such issues of aeromedical importance.

The evaluation was made in terms of understanding crew resource management (CRM) concepts and adoption of CRM attitudes by the pilots. Eighty-eight pilots from different companies participated in this study. Results showed that attitudes of Filipino pilots strongly adhered to CRM principles. This may be attributed to strong management support for CRM practice and national culture. The Filipino culture of pakikisama and pakikibagay reinforced CRM teachings on teamwork and crew coordination. However, the large power gap in the Filipino culture seems to hinder open communication with superiors. The length of CRM training and its latency did not prove to be significant determinants of CRM-related attitudes. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

A total of 177 pilots completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to indicate the frequency with which they use GPS as a primary source of navigation, the decision strategy that is most like the strategy that they engage during in-flight weather-related decision making, and their perception of the significance of 9 weather-related cues as the basis for decision making. Overall, the results revealed a relation between the perceived use of GPS as a primary source of navigation and the use of aspects of prototypical or tactical decision strategies. Relations were also evident between the perceived use of GPS and the perceived significance of weather-related cues. It was concluded that the introduction of advanced technology systems such as GPS may be associated with a qualitative change in the way in which pilots acquire task-related information and formulate decisions. These outcomes are discussed in terms of a number of applied interventions. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

The use of force feedback through a haptic control device allows the operator to perceive information of the environment through the sense of touch. This would complement the visual information and is hypothesized to increase situation awareness, especially in situations where visual information is insufficient. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel virtual force field that maps environment constraints to virtual forces on a control stick. The force field was designed in such a way that its size and shape, hence the field sensitivity, could be determined through adjustments of its parameters. An experimental evaluation was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the haptic interface. Results show that the haptic interface reduces the amount of collisions considerably, contributing to a higher level of safety when a complex task needs to be performed with limited visual information. Operator workload and control activity, however, slightly increased with the haptic interface. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"
2007,Pakistan - Sweden,The value of spatial cues in 3D air traffic displays,"<title>The value of spatial cues in 3D air traffic displays</title> <abstract>Interest in implementing 3D pictorial displays for traffic information in aircraft has been prevalent for decades without any obvious implementation in the cockpit. Our research is focused on design issues for these displays. The purpose of the experiments discussed here was to investigate where and when additional spatial cues, e.g., drop-lines, could contribute to better performance and whether such additions could replace shifts between 2D and 3D presentation for different tasks. Our results show that drop-lines are beneficial in focused attention tasks but are not necessarily beneficial in more integrated tasks. This speaks to the need for an adaptive approach to the presentation of flight situation displays. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"
2007,Australia - South Africa,Development and validation of a measure to assess perceptions regarding gender-related pilot behavior,"<title>Development and validation of a measure to assess perceptions regarding gender-related pilot behavior</title> <abstract>There are several stereotypes, prejudices and preconceptions regarding female aviators' abilities and the suitability of women for a career as professional aircraft pilots. This study reports on the development and validation of the Aviation Gender Attitude Questionnaire (AGAQ), which was designed to assess aviators' perceptions about gender-related pilot behavior. A total of 544 South African aircraft pilots participated in the validation of the questionnaire. A four-factor measurement model was established by using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed a good fit between the multifactor solution for the AGAQ and the data. The four factors associated with perceptions about gender-related pilot behavior were Flying Proficiency, Safety Orientation, Flight Confidence and Flight Standards.

2007,United States,Unusual attitude recoveries with a spatial disorientation icon,"<title>Unusual attitude recoveries with a spatial disorientation icon</title> <abstract>Twenty-two participants (12 with prior flying experience and 12 without), performed a series of trials in a low fidelity flight simulator in which they attempted to recover from a series of unusual attitudes. Two display variables were examined: (1) the attitude display was either a traditional head-up display (HUD) with an inside-out motion and pitch ladder, or an Arc-Segmented Attitude Reference (ASAR) display; and (2) a command icon that pointed to the appropriate airplane rotation for recovery direction in pitch and roll was either present or absent. The results revealed that the icon speeded the initial correction and reduced the number of roll reversal errors, while the traditional HUD decreased the total time to recovery. Experienced pilots were more disrupted by the ASAR display than were novices. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"
2006,United States,Air traffic control specialist age and en route operational errors,"<title>Air traffic control specialist age and en route operational errors</title> <abstract>U.S. federal law requires that air traffic control specialists (ATCSs) hired after May 16, 1972 retire at age 56 on the premise that the risk of adverse events such as operational errors (OEs) increases with age (U.S. House of Representatives, 1971). OE count was modeled as a function of en route ATCS age and exposure to test that premise using Poisson regression. The odds of OE involvement for older (age 56 and older) and younger (age 55 or less) ATCSs were equal. These results suggest that the rationale for mandatory retirement of controllers might need to be reexamined through continued research.

2006,Netherlands,Ecological interface design for terrain awareness,"<title>Ecological interface design for terrain awareness</title> <abstract>Advanced terrain warning systems, such as the enhanced ground proximity warning system, and safety-enhancing displays, like the synthetic vision system, have proven to play an important role in reducing the number of controlled flight into terrain accidents. Research indicated, however, that terrain collisions may still occur for aircraft equipped with these systems. Synthetic vision allows for perception of the environment, but lacks properties to support understanding and extrapolation of the perceived data. A terrain warning system provides elementary meaning to the environment, but is not well integrated into synthetic vision displays. To further increase terrain awareness and, ultimately, eliminate terrain collisions, synthetic vision should be integrated with a terrain awareness functionality that allows the pilot to be continuously informed about how the external constraints (imposed by the terrain) relate to the internal aircraft constraints (e.g., climb performances). Based on that information, pilots can judge for themselves what an obstacle actually means to them in terms of possibilities to fly over it, and if not, what the alternatives for action are. In this article, the paradigm of ecological interface design is used to analyze the aircraft manual control task in the vertical plane and to develop a more meaningful interface for (vertical) terrain awareness. An abstraction hierarchy is presented, developed for the task of guiding an aircraft through a terrain-challenged environment. The design and experimental evaluation of a vertical situation display are discussed, enhanced with ecological overlays to increase terrain awareness.

2006,Germany - United States,Effects of automated conflict cuing and traffic density on air traffic controller performance and visual attention in a datalink environment,"<title>Effects of automated conflict cuing and traffic density on air traffic controller performance and visual attention in a datalink environment</title> <abstract>Proposals to enhance the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic control system involve new technologies such as automated decision aids and datalink that could create additional demands for the limited visual attentional resources of controllers. This study investigated whether automated multimodal conflict cues could mitigate these demands, particularly under high-traffic load. Measures of conflict detection performance and eye movements were obtained from full performance controllers in a simulated air traffic control task with datalink. It was hypothesized that multimodal cuing would improve advance notification of conflicts and lead to earlier detection than purely visual cuing by better guiding visual attention. High-traffic density had significantly negative effects on performance. However, although cuing enhanced performance, no specific benefit of multimodal cuing for performance or visual attention was found. Implications for controller visual attention and for the design of automated decision aids are discussed. Copyright © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"
2006,United States,Visual factors affecting touchdown point judgments during off-airport emergency landings,"<title>Visual factors affecting touchdown point judgments during off-airport emergency landings</title> <abstract>This article provides a comprehensive discussion of research designed to examine the possible existence of consistent visual misperceptions that may occur during off-airport emergency landings. The importance of 2 particular visual experiences was evaluated: (a) the view of the world seen from the unusually steep bank at a low altitude, and (b) the visual distraction of a ""windmilling"" propeller. The influences of experience and environmental structure were also considered. Studies of these factors were conducted using a visually realistic cockpit mounted within a VisionDome® virtual reality environment. Behavioral responses were collected from both naive participants and pilot participants. The findings indicated that judgments of the position of the touchdown point made while the airplane is turning are underestimated in distance, whereas judgments made while the airplane is on a straight approach to the touchdown point are overestimated. In most cases, the windmilling propeller decreased touchdown point judgment accuracy. In addition, pilot experience was associated with improved judgment accuracy during the turning approaches. The presented environmental structure had a weak and inconsistent effect. Copyright © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

Three experiments investigated the effects of display dimensionality, conflict geometry, and time pressure of in-flight conflicts on performance. The results indicated that interactive viewpoints in 2 3-D displays eliminated ambiguity costs, resulting in performance on both tasks comparable to a 2-D coplanar display. Viewpoint interactivity in the 3-D displays was vulnerable to increased workload, although corresponding performance was no worse than the 2-D coplanar. All 3 display formats showed performance decrements for nonlevel conflict geometries and increased time pressure. Copyright © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

This study investigated mode awareness by measuring eye point of gaze of both pilots during simulated commercial flights, while recording call-outs and tracking aircraft performance. The results of this study show that the compliance to manufacturer or air carrier procedures regarding mode monitoring and call-outs was very low. However, this did not seem to have a negative effect on the flight path or safety during our observations. Crews exhibited a proliferation of strategies to keep track of status and behavior of the automation, often with little reliance on the flight mode annunciations of the primary flight display. The data confirm the limitations of current flight mode annunciator designs, and suggest that mode awareness is a more complex phenomenon than what can be captured by measuring eye point of gaze and communication alone.

2006,United States,Organizational factors in commercial aviation accidents,"<title>Organizational factors in commercial aviation accidents</title> <abstract>In recent years, several major transportation accidents have brought significant attention to the role organizational factors play in motivating operator safety within high-risk systems, yet very little has been studied regarding the direct contribution organizational factors play in accidents. This study elucidates the types of organizational factors associated with aviation accidents attributed principally to pilot error, through case-based analyses of commercial accidents from 1990 to 2000. Results indicate inadequate procedures and directives rank highest among organizational problems. Findings suggest interventions aimed at organizational contributions may potentially ameliorate a myriad of systemic problems, rather than assigning blame to the pilot at the operational level.

Competence-based assessment results in more effective learning processes and better founded pass-fail decisions, which may contribute to an increased output of competent controllers from training. At Air Traffic Control The Netherlands (LVNL) we designed an assessment system based on a newly defined set of competences. The ATC Performance Model, derived from this competence analysis, has served as a framework for the design.

Three distinctly different sources of cognitive complexity are proposed: environmental, organizational, and display. Two experiments were conducted to explore whether these proposed components of complexity could be effectively partitioned, measured, and compared. The findings demonstrate that sources of complexity can be decomposed and measured and furthermore, the use of color in displays, a display design intervention meant to reduce environmental complexity, can actually contribute to it.

2006,United States,Difficult access: The impact of recall steps on flight management system errors,"<title>Difficult access: The impact of recall steps on flight management system errors</title> <abstract>This study examines flight management system (FMS) tasks and errors by C-130 pilots who were recently qualified on a newly introduced advanced FMS. Twenty flight tasks supported by the FMS were analyzed using a cognitive stage model (Sherry, Polson, Feary, & Palmer, 2002) to identify steps with the potential for errors. If a step was found not to have visual cues such as labels or prompts for the required action sequence it was identified as a recall step and a potential source of difficulty. If the action was supported by salient labels and prompts it was identified as a recognition step. Actual pilots using an FMS were observed and performance and errors categorized into the related task step. The greatest amount of observed difficulty was accessing the correct function, labeled as an access error. This process was found to be particularly vulnerable to recall problems. Pilots had the likelihood of .74 for committing an access error on tasks with 2 recalled access steps. This is compared to .13 for 1 recalled access step and .06 for no recalled access steps. Errors associated with formatting, inserting, or verifying entries were less common than access errors; however, these errors primarily occurred on tasks in which recall steps were required for the related step. A total of 93% of the format errors, 80% of the insert errors, and 81% of the verify errors occurred on the tasks that did not have good recognition support for each associated step. On a positive note, experience with the new FMS in the preceding 6 months was correlated with a decrease in overall errors, r(22) = -.42, p < .05, and a decrease in errors associated with inadequate knowledge to accomplish a required step, r(22) =-.61, p <. 01.

2006,New Zealand,Cognitive functions and performance shaping factors in aviation accidents and incidents,"<title>Cognitive functions and performance shaping factors in aviation accidents and incidents</title> <abstract>Is the difference between an accident and an incident merely a matter of luck, or are there significant differences in terms of flight crew performance and associated performance shaping factors (PSFs)? This study obtained self-report data from a sample of 1,144 New Zealand pilots. There were differences between accident- and incident-involved pilots in terms of age, flight experience, and involvement in hazardous events. Incidents were more likely to be attributed to failures to detect or diagnose information, whereas accidents were more likely to be attributed to failures to choose an appropriate goal or strategy. There was no difference in the quantity of PSFs associated with accidents and incidents. These self-report data are consistent with previous findings based on external coding of air accident reports.

2006,United States,Development and initial validation of a survey for assessing safety culture within commercial flight operations,"<title>Development and initial validation of a survey for assessing safety culture within commercial flight operations</title> <abstract>This article describes efforts to validate a safety culture survey for aviation operations based on the 5-factor model suggested by Wiegmann, Zhang, von Thaden, Gibbons, and Sharma (2004). The 5-factor model includes organizational commitment, management involvement, pilot empowerment, reporting systems, and accountability systems as they pertain to safety within an airline. The Commercial Aviation Safety Survey, designed around these 5 factors, was distributed to pilots and managers of a large U.S. airline for anonymous completion. A total of 503 completed surveys were obtained for further analysis (29% return rate). Results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the original 5-factor model of safety culture did not fit as well as hypothesized. Additional exploratory analyses were then conducted to determine specific areas of misalignment of the data with the model. Results from these analyses and respondent comments informed a conceptual revision of the model and survey. The new model contains 4 main factors and 11 subfactors. A revised version of the survey, following the revised model, is presented. Additional issues identified include the need to account for the atypical structure of management-employee relationships in airline flight operations compared to the structure of other traditional industrial settings in which the concept of safety culture originated.

2006,United States,Risk perception among general aviation pilots,"<title>Risk perception among general aviation pilots</title> <abstract>Two measures of pilot risk perception are described. One measure assessed pilots' perception of the level of risk experienced by other, fictional, pilots, and the second measure assessed the pilots' perceptions of the level of risk they would experience if they were personally involved in a set of scenarios. Analyses are reported for factor scores derived from the 2 measures. Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences in the risk ratings for the 4 pilot certificate groups, with the more advanced certificate holders (i.e., commercial and airline transport) reporting lower levels of perceived risk. Construct validity was assessed using only private pilots (N = 369). Correlations between the factor scores and measures related to the constructs generally supported the construct validity of the risk perception measures. Inaccurate risk perception, measured as the discrepancy between the perceived risks of flying and driving, was found to be a better indicator of involvement in hazardous aviation events than any of the factor scores. It is suggested that the risk perception measures be used by other investigators to assess the contributions of these constructs to accident involvement in comparison to the contribution of other constructs.

From the results of these and related studies, we developed a hypothetical framework and model of task prioritization in which procedural consistency, importance to flight safety, and the salience of task-related stimuli are the primary factors that affect task prioritization.

We based the analysis on the techniques developed by Hunter and Schmidt (1990). We used a d statistic for effect size calculations based on information available in the included sources. We reviewed and considered 11 studies for analysis, but only 7 of these included the information necessary for calculating effect size and we included these in the study. The result of the MA suggest a small, positive effect for motion, d=.16. No credibility interval could be built around this estimate of population mean effect size because the resulting sampling error variance was larger than the observed variance in d across the assessed studies. This led to a negative variance estimate for 5 and subsequently an estimated SD <inf>δ&</inf> of 0. These results suggest that simulator motion has a small, positive effect on pilot training transfer and contradict an earlier MA on the same subject. The small sample size (few studies) and methodological shortcomings within the included studies require that the findings be interpreted cautiously. We discuss alternative interpretations and their implications for the aviation training community. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

However, the associations among violations, flight experience, and pilot age have not been well studied. In this study, we aimed to examine risk of violation in relation to pilot age and other pilot characteristics based on exposure to flight in a fixed birth cohort of 3,306 commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots who in 1987 were aged 45 to 54 years. We merged different data files from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration for the years 1987 to 1997, and we analyzed violation rates per pilot flight hour in relation to total flight hours at baseline and pilot age at time of violation. During the 11-year follow-up period, a total of 12.9 million cumulative flight hours and 71 violations were recorded, yielding a rate of 5.5 violations per million pilot flight hours. Violation rate increased significantly with age from age 40 to the late 50s. Pilots who were 50 to 54 years old at baseline experienced almost twice the rate of violation involvement as pilots who were 45 to 49 years old at baseline. Total flight time at baseline, an indicator of flight experience, showed a significant protective effect against risk of violation. With adjustments for age, pilots who had 5,000 to 9,999 hr of total flight time at baseline were at significantly lower risk of violation than their less experienced counterparts (relative risk 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.85). Flight experience showed a diminishing protective effect after pilots reached 10,000 hr of total flight time. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

The program consisted of an Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise in which research participants learn through operant conditioning techniques to regulate several physiological responses to suppress their symptoms. We evaluated training progress during rotating-chair motion sickness tests. We assessed motion sickness tolerance by calculating the number of cumulative rotations that research participants were able to achieve in the rotating chair prior to reaching their major malaise endpoint. We rated motion sickness symptoms using a standard diagnostic scale. We obtained physiological data from one pilot during a training flight in an F-18 aircraft after completion of his training. Results demonstrate a significant increase in tolerance to laboratory-induced motion sickness tests and a reduction in autonomic nervous system response levels following training. During subsequent flight qualification tests on F-18 and T-38 aircraft, both pilots were successful at controlling their airsickness and were returned to active flight status.</abstract>"

The pilots' activities were recorded in actual revenue-generating line operations at 7.5-sec intervals during climbs and descents during 193 flights in 2 models of the B737-200 and in 2 models of the B737-300. Eight of the 23 activities were assumed not to be affected by the duration of the climbs and descents and were analyzed using analysis of variance. The observed frequencies of the other 15 activities were analyzed using the length of the climb and descent as a covariate. The results showed that the frequency of housekeeping activities and communication activities tended not to be affected by the level of cockpit automation. In contrast, the frequency of most of the activities related to flight path control varied with the level of cockpit automation. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"
2005,France - Netherlands - United States,Theoretical foundations for a total energy-based perspective flight-path display,"<title>Theoretical foundations for a total energy-based perspective flight-path display</title> <abstract>One of the most difficult aspects of manually controlled flight is the coupling between the control over the aircraft speed and altitude. These states cannot be changed independent of each other through the aircraft control devices, the elevator and the throttle. Rather, to effectively change an aircraft's speed and altitude, the controls have to be coordinated. The mediating mechanism that underlies the coordination of the controls is the management of the aircraft's energy state. This article shows that the abstraction hierarchy (AH; Rasmussen, 1986) framework can be effectively used to gain more insight into the underlying structure of the aircraft energy management problem. The derived AH representation is based on the analysis of the energy constraints on the control task. It reveals the levels of abstraction necessary to link the aircraft's physical controls to the speed and altitude goals and also how the aircraft energy is a critical mediating state of the control problem. Energy awareness can be increased by presenting explicit energy management information. The powerful and novel concepts of the total energy reference profile and energy angle are introduced in this article and applied in the context of a perspective flight-path display. The resulting display presents energy management information fully integrated with the tunnel-in-the-sky display and reveals 5 new and important energy cues, intuitively linking the controls and the goals.

The amount of fatigue experienced by the aviators in an operational EP-3 squadron was quantified before and after interventions were made to promote crew rest. Surveys were completed for 10 days by 2 separate flight crews transitioning to a Southwest Asia detachment site from Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington. The second crew (Crew B) underwent fatigue countermeasures training several days prior to departure and were provided with 1 additional layover day between the second and third day of transit. The additional layover period was provided in an effort to maximize crew rest prior to a difficult night transit 3 days into the journey. The surveys quantified: self-reported sleep quantity, sleep quality, sleep debt, and fatigue ratings during the 3 phases of flight: takeoff to top of climb, top of climb to top of descent, and top of descent to landing. Baseline data were collected from the first crew (Crew A) and were then compared to that of the second crew (Crew B). Crew A experienced greater fatigue, a larger sleep debt, and decreased sleep quality compared to Crew B. Both crews demonstrated low sleep quality ratings on the second day of the transit as well as high fatigue ratings after the third leg of the transit. Crew B received more total sleep prior to the third leg of the transit due to the additional layover day. This additional rest period resulted in decreased fatigue ratings for Crew B. Sleep quality tended to be lower on the nights preceding a scheduled flight and higher on days off. Providing additional layover time and fatigue countermeasures training resulted in decreased fatigue, increased sleep quantity, and improved sleep quality.</abstract>"
2005,United States,Using computational cognitive modeling to diagnose possible sources of aviation error,"<title>Using computational cognitive modeling to diagnose possible sources of aviation error</title> <abstract>We present a computational model of a closed-loop, pilot-aircraft-visual scene-taxiway system created to shed light on possible sources of taxi error. The creation of the cognitive aspects of the model with ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) required us to conduct studies with subject matter experts to identify the experiential adaptations pilots bring to taxiing. Five decision strategies were found, ranging from cognitively intensive but precise to fast and frugal but robust. We provide evidence for the model by comparing its behavior to a National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center simulation of Chicago O'Hare surface operations. Decision horizons were highly variable; the model selected the most accurate strategy given the time available. We found a signature in the simulation data of the use of globally robust heuristics to cope with short decision horizons as revealed by the errors occurring most frequently at atypical taxiway geometries or clearance routes. These data provided empirical support for the model. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</abstract>"

I hypothesized that complex manual flying skills, learned on the ground, transfer to the aircraft. The results provide no objective support for this hypothesis. There were no significant differences in flying skills between the three groups as measured by the flight-data recordings. However, both experimental (PC) groups managed to fly significantly more maneuvers in the same amount of flight time in the aircraft and received better instructor ratings. I analyze these differences in detail. In the discussion, I compare the findings with published transfer experiments with PC-based simulation.</abstract>"
2005,Canada,Examining the effects of combined stressors on dynamic task performance,"<title>Examining the effects of combined stressors on dynamic task performance</title> <abstract>In this study, I examined the effects of sleep loss, time pressure, and workload on performance in a dynamic air traffic control (ATC) task. Participants performed the ATC task following 8, 16, and 24 hr of sleep loss under conditions of low and high time pressure and workload. In general, the findings revealed that ATC performance was susceptible to the effects of time pressure and workload. However, there was only partial support for the assumption that the effects of sleep loss on performance are dependent on the level of cognitive challenge posed by a task. Furthermore, I observed a dissociation between ATC performance and subjective assessments of workload (i.e., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index; Hart & Staveland, 1988), suggesting that the cognitive processes responsible for performance are not identical to those processes responsible for subjective assessments of workload.</abstract>"
2005,United States,Measurement of hazardous attitudes among pilots,"<title>Measurement of hazardous attitudes among pilots</title> <abstract>I present data on the psychometric characteristics and construct validity of two Likert-type scales constructed to assess pilots' attitudes. These new scales were developed to assess the factors (Antiauthority, Macho, Invulnerability, Impulsivity, and Resignation) that have been suggested by previous research as being related to pilots' involvement in accidents. I compared results from the new scales with results from an ipsative scale contained in training developed by the Federal Aviation Administration. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority, both in terms of psychometric characteristics and construct validity, of the Likert-type scales. I suggest that the new scales should be used in those instances in which accurate measurement of the attitudes is needed, specifically to assess the contribution of pilots' attitudes to accident involvement and to assess of the impact of training.</abstract>"
2005,United States,"Perspective and coplanar cockpit displays of traffic information: Implications for maneuver choice, flight safety, and mental workload","<title>Perspective and coplanar cockpit displays of traffic information: Implications for maneuver choice, flight safety, and mental workload</title> <abstract>In 3 experiments, we examined maneuver choice, flight safety, and mental workload across 3-dimensional (3D) perspective and 2-dimensional coplanar cockpit displays of traffic information in a free-flight simulation. In Experiment 1 (30 pilots), we examined dimensionality issues; in Experiments 2 and 3 (18 pilots each), we examined the effects of traffic density, dimensionality, and vertical profile orientation. Collectively, these data may be modeled by trade-offs between the display types: The coplanar suite suffers from scanning-related integration that increases with conflict density; the 3D display suffers from perceptual ambiguity. This research informs our understanding of how displays modulate performance in free-flight environments.</abstract>"
2004,Netherlands,Effectiveness of 3-D audio for warnings in the cockpit,"<title>Effectiveness of 3-D audio for warnings in the cockpit</title> <abstract>We investigated the application of 3-dimensional (3-D) audio for presenting auditory warnings in the cockpit in two simulator experiments. Pilots had to respond to warnings of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System and to system malfunction warnings. Visual warning displays were always present. The first experiment showed 12% faster response times when 3-D audio was used compared to mono sound. This was only observed when flight path error information was presented on a visual head-down display. No effect was observed when an auditory error display was used because this enabled pilots to pay more attention to the visual warning displays. In the second experiment, only a visual error display was employed, and the effects of 3-D audio and verbal directional information (e.g., ""up"") were tested. Each type of cue resulted in a 12% reduction of response times. The combination of 3-D audio and verbal cues resulted in the best performance, with response time reductions of approximately 23%. These results indicate that 3-D audio displays can improve flight safety.</abstract>"
2004,Australia,Effects of supplementing head-down displays with 3-D audio during visual target acquisition,"<title>Effects of supplementing head-down displays with 3-D audio during visual target acquisition</title> <abstract>We investigated the effectiveness of supplementing head-down displays (HDDs) with high-fidelity 3-dimensional (3-D) audio using a flight simulation task in which participants were required to visually acquire the image of a target aircraft. There were 3 conditions: a visual HDD providing azimuth information combined with a nonspatial audio cue, a visual HDD providing azimuth and elevation information combined with a nonspatial audio cue, and a visual HDD providing azimuth information combined with a 3-D audio cue. When 3-D audio was presented, the visual acquisition time was faster, perceived workload was reduced, and perceived situational awareness was improved. This performance improvement was attributed to the fact that participants were often able to perform the task without the need to refer to the HDD.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Evaluating adaptive multisensory displays for target localization in a flight task,"<title>Evaluating adaptive multisensory displays for target localization in a flight task</title> <abstract>This study was designed to determine the efficacy of providing target location information via head-coupled visual and spatial audio displays presented in adaptive and nonadaptive configurations. Twelve United States Air Force pilots performed a simulated flight task in which they were instructed to maintain flight parameters while searching for ground and air targets. The integration of visual displays with spatial audio cueing enhanced performance efficiency, especially when targets were most difficult to detect. Several of the interface conditions were also associated with lower ratings of perceived mental workload. The benefits associated with multisensory cueing were equivalent in both adaptive and nonadaptive configurations.</abstract>"
2004,Netherlands,3-D audio in the fighter cockpit improves task performance,"<title>3-D audio in the fighter cockpit improves task performance</title> <abstract>A flight simulator experiment was conducted to explore the benefits of 3-dimensional (3-D) audio to support in-cockpit tasks regarding performance and workload. In half of the conditions, 1 or 2 tasks requiring information from a head-down display (HDD) were supported by 3-D audio. The performance on several tasks improved when 3-D audio was present, whereas no negative performance effects were found. Furthermore, the frequency of eye movements to the HDD was reduced more than 50% in all 3-D audio conditions. Physiological measures were not affected, indicating that mental effort was the same in all conditions. Only a small reduction in subjective workload in some 3-D audio conditions was observed. Pilots were also able to process the information from 2 independent 3-D auditory displays that were present at the same time. The results show that pilots can perform flight and in-cockpit tasks more efficiently when they are supported by 3-D audio.</abstract>"

In this article, we review several experiments that have used a consistent procedure to evaluate the effect of four monaural parameters on overall intelligibility. We also present the results of a new experiment that has used the same procedure to examine the influence of 2 additional factors in binaural speech displays: (a) the apparent spatial locations of the talkers and (b) the listener's a priori information about the listening task.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Considerations for training team situation awareness and task performance through PC-gamer simulated multiship helicopter operations,"<title>Considerations for training team situation awareness and task performance through PC-gamer simulated multiship helicopter operations</title> <abstract>In this research, we considered the development and implementation of a Targeted Acceptable Response to Generated Events or Tasks methodology (Fowlkes, Dwyer, Oser, & Salas, 1998; Fowlkes, Lane, Salas, Franz, & Oser, 1994) for training of intercockpit team situational awareness and task performance. Additionally, we considered the usability and suitability of a PC-gamer approach for simulation of multiship helicopter operations. In this research, we extended the concept of situation awareness and task performance from the traditional intracockpit crew focus to an intercockpit team perspective. That extension necessitated the development of evaluation instruments that link events, which affect the multiship aviation team, to their situational awareness and task performance. Further, we discuss the usability of the off-the-shelf PC-gamer interface and software used in the research along with suggestions for future research.</abstract>"
2004,Australia,Predictors of threat and error management: Identification of core nontechnical skills and implications for training systems design,"<title>Predictors of threat and error management: Identification of core nontechnical skills and implications for training systems design</title> <abstract>In normal flight operations, crews are faced with a variety of external threats and commit a range of errors that have the potential to impact negatively on the safety of airline operations. The effective management of these threats and errors therefore forms an essential element of enhancing performance and minimizing risk. Recent research has reinforced the need to examine a range of nontechnical or crew resource management skills that form threat and error countermeasures. This article provides an analysis of the predictors of threat and error management in normal flight operations within the context of a Southeast Asian airline. Through the structured observation of crews' performance during normal flight operations, data were collected in relation to a set of contextual factors and nontechnical skills. Crews' threat and error management actions were then analyzed in relation to these factors, and predictive models of threat and error management at various phases of flight were developed. The results of this study demonstrate the ways in which this type of data analysis can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of operational performance and suggest that this type of performance evaluation can offer individual organizations invaluable information for enhanced training system design through the further development of scenario-based training.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Automatic dependent surveillance - Broadcast/cockpit display of traffic information: Innovations in pilot-managed departures,"<title>Automatic dependent surveillance - Broadcast/cockpit display of traffic information: Innovations in pilot-managed departures</title> <abstract>An operational evaluation of the automatic dependent surveillance system and cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) was performed in October 2000. It provided an opportunity to examine how the use of a CDTI influences pilot/controller operational communications. Departure profiles were established to evaluate the ability of flight crews and air traffic controllers to manage long (6 nautical miles [nm]) and short (4.5 nm) spacing intervals between departing aircraft. Approximately 4% of the departures conducted when CDTI was not used and 9% when it was involved communication problems. Fortunately, controllers and pilots detected and corrected these problems in midstream. When pilots executed CDTI departures, there was an overall increase in time on frequency, more time spent under local control during the day, and departures were completed in less time when assigned the short spacing interval.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Time delays in air traffic control communication loop: Effect on controller performance and workload,"<title>Time delays in air traffic control communication loop: Effect on controller performance and workload</title> <abstract>The impact of digital technology-induced delays in the pilot-controller communications on air traffic controllers' performance and workload was investigated in 2 experiments manipulating systemic audio delay (AD) and variable pilot delay (PD). Vectoring accuracy (Experiment 1), lateral separation between 2 aircraft on converging tracks (Experiment 2), and subjective workload (NASA-Task Load Index) were measured. In Experiment 1, the effect of AD was measurable but not statistically significant; PD reduced accuracy and resulted in earlier turn initiations. In Experiment 2, both AD and PD significantly reduced separation between aircrafts. Short communication delays, however, did not substantially degrade controller performance in the experiments.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Improved Flight Technical Performance in Flight Decks Equipped with Synthetic Vision Information System Displays,"<title>Improved Flight Technical Performance in Flight Decks Equipped with Synthetic Vision Information System Displays</title> <abstract>Synthetic vision information systems (SVIS) are the next generation of cockpit display systems that will become an integral part of the commercial flight deck in the future. The goal of this study was to evaluate SVIS against conventional glass cockpit displays to assess whether or not SVIS can improve pilot performance, situation awareness (SA), and workload. The evaluation was conducted in a fixed-base laboratory flight simulator located in the Operator Performance Laboratory at the University of Iowa. A total of 12 pilot evaluators hand-flew fairly difficult approaches into the Eagle County, Colorado, airport. Specially designed questionnaires were used in various phases of the flights to estimate workload, SA, and user preference. Information relating to SA was collected using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique and workload estimates were obtained using the NASA Task Loading Index technique. Eye movement data were collected using a modified [Scan ETL 500 system, and analyzed to find a link analysis (an analysis of eye movement transitions between areas of interest on the displays), scan length, fixation frequencies, location of fixations, and duration of fixations. Flight technical error performance was derived. Analysis results indicate that the SVIS is superior to the conventional displays for the majority of the measures that were obtained in the experiments.</abstract>"

Two experiments were conducted to examine the efficacy of these displays and develop field-of-view and terrain texture recommendations for design. The first experiment examined issues of field of view and display size using an Asheville, North Carolina, synthetic vision database and fixed-based simulator. The second experiment was conducted on the NASA B-757 aircraft at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and investigated the efficacy of both head-down and head-up displays and generic and photorealistic terrain texture. Both experiments confirmed the retrofit capability and that all sizes and texturing methods were found to be viable candidates for synthetic vision displays. These results, future directions, and implications for meeting national aeronautic safety and capacity goals are discussed.</abstract>"
2004,United States,Why Pilots Miss the Green Box: How Display Context Undermines Attention Capture,"<title>Why Pilots Miss the Green Box: How Display Context Undermines Attention Capture</title> <abstract>Visual displays often employ the onset or flashing of an element to notify users of important events. Recent research findings and operational experiences in data-rich, event-driven domains, such as aviation, suggest that this design approach, which was supported by findings from early basic research on attention capture, is not always successful. The goal of this study was to examine how display context affects the effectiveness of abrupt onset signals. Participants in this study performed an externally paced visual task while trying to detect abrupt-onset stimuli, which were presented against 5 different display backgrounds and at 2 different eccentricities. The display background varied in terms of its dynamics and its color similarity to the target. Color similarity, the movement of background elements, and increasing target eccentricity resulted in reduced detection performance. The findings from this study help explain why pilots on modern flight decks sometimes miss changes in the status and behavior of their automated systems. More generally, they illustrate the importance of considering display context and the need to adapt findings from laboratory research when designing interfaces for complex environments.</abstract>"

Despite their widespread use, the construct validity of LOS ratings remains largely unexplored. Preliminary evidence suggests that LOS ratings cluster by phase of flight, rather than by the technical and crew resource management skills that they are intended to measure. These results are consistent with findings from the assessment center literature. After comparing and contrasting the LOS and assessment center techniques, we provide research-based guidelines for improving the construct validity of LOS ratings.</abstract>"
2004,Portugal,Dynamic Spatial Ability: An Exploratory Analysis and a Confirmatory Study,"<title>Dynamic Spatial Ability: An Exploratory Analysis and a Confirmatory Study</title> <abstract>Spatial ability is included in nearly every multiple aptitude battery. However, it has been defined and evaluated in such a variety of ways that it is difficult to be precise about the meaning of the concept. A first study addresses the spatial literature, considers several measures, and empirically explores the dimensionality of the spatial domain. Nine spatial ability tests and 1 computer-administered measure were administered to a total of 104 volunteers. Results from the exploratory factor analysis identified 3 main factors: visualization, spatial relations, and dynamic spatial ability. A second study was conducted to cross-validate this factor structure. A total of 141 participants were involved in this study. Participants were recruited from professional training domains in which spatial ability has been considered important for successful performance: air traffic control, piloting, civil engineering, and architecture. Cross-validation was obtained through a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In general, both empirical studies confirm the existence of dynamic spatial ability as a distinct dimension within the spatial domain.</abstract>"
2003,United States,Pilot Motivation and Performance: Theoretical and Empirical Relationships,"<title>Pilot Motivation and Performance: Theoretical and Empirical Relationships</title> <abstract>This study examines the relationship between pilot motivation and flight performance in student pilots attending an aviation university. Predictions about motivation-performance relationships were based on intrinsic-extrinsic motivation distinctions. Results indicated that there was a robust relationship between motivation and performance, in that the greater the number of student cancellations during a course of training, the lower the student performance in actual flight training. Limitations and strengths of this study are discussed, with suggestions for future research.</abstract>"
2003,United States,Measuring General Aviation Pilot Judgment Using a Situational Judgment Technique,"<title>Measuring General Aviation Pilot Judgment Using a Situational Judgment Technique</title> <abstract>This paper reports on 2 studies that were conducted to develop and to evaluate a situational judgment test (SJT) for general aviation (GA) pilots. An initial 51-item test was constructed in which each item described an in-flight situation that required a decision on the part of the pilot and 4 alternative solutions to the situation. Subject matter experts were used to generate a scoring key from the alternatives that the experts recommended for a typical GA pilot. In Study 1, the test was administered in paper-and-pencil format to 246 participants. Results from that first study showed that the test had acceptable psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency and distribution. In Study 2, the test was administered to 467 participants over the Internet. Analyses resulted in the reduction of the test to 39 items, with an internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha) of .747. Construct validation was accomplished through correlation with a measure of the number of times the participant had been involved in an accident or other hazardous aviation event. Pilots who had higher (better) scores on the SJT were found to have experienced fewer hazardous events, which was taken as supporting the construct validity of the test. Evaluation of mode of administration (paper-and-pencil vs. Internet) showed that the 2 forms were equivalent. These results suggest that the SJT has potential for use in the assessment of judgment or aeronautical decision making by GA pilots, and might be useful in the evaluation of training. The implications of the findings, regarding equivalence of the 2 administration formats, are discussed.</abstract>"
2003,United States,"Expertise, Cognitive Ability, and Age Effects on Pilot Communication","<title>Expertise, Cognitive Ability, and Age Effects on Pilot Communication</title> <abstract>We investigated whether expertise reduced age-related declines in pilot communication, using multiple expertise measures and laboratory tasks varying in domain relevance. Younger, middle-aged, and older pilots and nonpilots listened to air traffic control messages that described an aircraft's route through an airspace, while they referred to a chart of that airspace. They read back each message, then answered a probe question about the aircraft's route. Pilots read back messages more accurately than did nonpilots, and younger participants were more accurate than older participants. Expertise and aging had similar effects on the probe task, suggesting that these groups were better able to interpret the air traffic control messages in relation to the chart, in order to create a situation model of the flight. Expertise did not moderate age-related declines on the aviation tasks studied here. There was, however, some evidence that more flying experience among older pilots (compared to younger pilots) helped buffer against age-related declines in cognitive resources, in order to maintain performance on the readback task. Measures of working memory capacity and spatial ability predicted communication performance, suggesting the importance of designing communication tasks that reduce demands on cognitive abilities and that support the use of domain knowledge.</abstract>"

One hundred and six instrument-current pilots received an instrument proficiency check (IPC) and were assigned equally to 3 independent training groups (aircraft, flight training device [FTD], and PC AID) and to a control group who received no training. The 3 training groups received recurrent training in their respective devices over the course of a 6-month period, following which all 4 groups received a second IPC. Pilots trained in the FTD and PCATD performed (a) comparably; (b) significantly better than the control group, indicating positive transfer of training; and (c) at least as well as the aircraft group.</abstract>"
2003,United States,Postintoxication effects of alcohol on flight performance after moderate and high blood alcohol levels,"<title>Postintoxication effects of alcohol on flight performance after moderate and high blood alcohol levels</title> <abstract>This study examined the impact of alcohol hangover on flight performance 11 hr after ingestion of alcohol. The participants were 36 instrument-rated and instrument-current male pilots who were 21 to 35 years of age, recruited from the Odegard Center for Aerospace Sciences at the University of North Dakota. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or 2 or 3 ml/kg of 100 proof Vodka the evening before their flights were scheduled. After alcohol was administered, participants were provided sleeping accommodations and breakfast the next morning. Starting at 8 a.m. participants were asked to fly two 75-min scenarios on a Frasca 241 simulator. Performance deficits were observed on measures of rate of turn and bank for the group who had ingested the largest dose of ethanol. In addition, participants in this group correctly carried out fewer directives from the air traffic controller than those who received the placebo or the 2 ml/kg dose. The hangover-induced deficits observed may have been larger if participants were tested at a simulated altitude. The necessity of measuring biological indexes of hangover are discussed.</abstract>"
2003,Australia - New Zealand,Expert and novice pilot perceptions of static in-flight images of weather,"<title>Expert and novice pilot perceptions of static in-flight images of weather</title> <abstract>Weather-related accidents continue to account for a significant proportion of fatal general aviation accidents. The aim of this study was to examine the nature of in-flight weather-related decision making in a task involving assessments of in-flight weather conditions. Pilots examined 10 photographic images of weather conditions taken during flight and were asked to judge whether it would be possible to continue the flight along the current track and altitude and remain in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). As part of their assessments, respondents were also asked to indicate the extent to which they used various cues. The results indicated that experts and novices appear to use in-flight cues differently, although this did not appear to influence perceptions concerning the possibility of flight under VMC. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the development of appropriate instructional systems.</abstract>"
2003,Netherlands,"An information-centered analysis of the tunnel-in-the-sky display, part two: Curved tunnel trajectories","<title>An information-centered analysis of the tunnel-in-the-sky display, part two: Curved tunnel trajectories</title> <abstract>A theoretical information-centered analysis that studies the effectiveness of the information presented by a tunnel-in-the-sky display in the aircraft guidance task of following curved trajectories is described. The analysis reveals important differences in the information as compared to the task of tracking straight trajectories investigated in a companion paper (Mulder, 2003). The optical gradients of perspective and compression that support pilot control behavior in straight tunnels are less useful in curved tunnels. First, curved trajectories yield no vanishing point or any other stationary optical invariant that can act as a reference for the change in the optical information. Second, only the optical gradients conveyed by the nearby elements of the tunnel provide valuable information about the aircraft locomotion. Third, due to the limitations of using a perspective display, the projection of a curved tunnel results in a biased pilot perception of the aircraft position and motion relative to the trajectory. The lower information-content of the display makes curved trajectories more difficult to follow than straight trajectories, deteriorating pilot path-following performance. A simulator experiment provides substantial evidence for these findings.</abstract>"
2003,Norfolk Island - United States,Investigation of alarm-related accidents and incidents in aviation,"<title>Investigation of alarm-related accidents and incidents in aviation</title> <abstract>With increases in technology, pilots have assumed the role of system monitors. As such, they have become dependent upon sensor-based alarm signals, some of which are unreliable. Researchers have shown that unreliable alarms foster mistrust and complacency by operators, and may degrade flight tasks and alarm reactions. To supplement available laboratory investigations, we tabulated the number of events involving true, false, and missed alarms within the Aviation Safety Reporting System database, the National Transportation Safety Board database, and the U.S. Army's Aviation Safety database. We also separated the results by aircraft type, avionics, flight phase, and specific problem. Our investigation revealed that alarm-related problems occur frequently across flight environments, and that false alarms remain a significant concern in aviation. Given the pervasiveness of alarm-related problems, it is important that future researchers devote considerable effort to improve aviation alarm systems.</abstract>"
2003,France,Cognitive control levels in air traffic radar controller activity,"<title>Cognitive control levels in air traffic radar controller activity</title> <abstract>Classically, cognitive control is conceived as a set of levels activated according to certain psychological or situational conditions. However, studies on process supervision and a recent theoretical model suggest the possibility of a parallel activation on different control levels. We have analyzed the en route radar controller activity of conflict detection and resolution. Variables included aircraft position drawings during simulation freezing periods and temporal relations between activity steps and air traffic temporal dynamics. Data show evidence for a distinction between drawings indicating anticipatory mental representations and an accurate synchronization of cognition with the air traffic dynamics. Inferences are drawn for the design of a new support tool capable of implementing controllers' abstract action plans.</abstract>"

Unfortunately, most incident reports are generally unstructured, providing little or no guidance to the reporter. Therefore, most reports contain information only about what happened, as opposed to why an incident happened, making identification of intervention and prevention strategies extremely difficult. This study seeks to help remedy this problem with incident reports by developing and testing a method for improving pilots' reporting of incidents. This method, coined the critical event reporting tool (CERT), is described, and research supporting its potential as an instrument for improving the quality of incident reports is provided.</abstract>"

This article focuses on how the activities of crew members in a B-727 cockpit collectively constitute a functional unit of cognition - a team of cognitive agents who must be coordinated with each other and their task environment. The article addresses actual crew performance executing the Before Takeoff Checklist and applies a model previously developed for characterizing individual cognitive properties underlying use of multiprocess systems. The analysis reveals mechanisms that are interruption-tolerant and enable robust preflight verification of aircraft configuration.</abstract>

To understand pilot interaction with a perspective tunnel display and to benefit from this understanding in display design, it is essential to investigate the manner in which pilots use the presented information. A theoretical information-centered analysis is described that studies the effectiveness of the information presented by the tunnel display in the pilot task of controlling an aircraft along straight trajectories. It is shown that in straight tunnel sections, the concept of using the optical gradients of perspective and compression in conjunction with pseudohorizons and the vanishing point, is very useful in understanding pilot behavior. Results from a simulator experiment validate the concept and confirm the effectiveness of following an information-centered methodology in tunnel display design.</abstract>"
2003,Australia - Norway - United States,Understanding how pilots make weather-related decisions,"<title>Understanding how pilots make weather-related decisions</title> <abstract>The decision-making strategies of pilots were examined using a linear modeling technique. Three hundred twenty-six American, 104 Norwegian, and 51 Australian pilots completed a scenario-based judgment task in which they assigned a comfort rating to each of 27 weather scenarios for each of three routes. These data were then used to develop individual regression equations, for each pilot, that described the information combination process used to assign the comfort ratings. The results demonstrate the use of a consistent weather decision model among pilots in these diverse groups. Intercorrelations of mean comfort levels for the 27 scenarios were very high, and each group demonstrated a similar pattern of information use. For each group, the compensatory models of information utilization were favored over noncompensatory models. The results suggest that pilots share a common model for the use of weather information and that training interventions may be equally effective across countries.</abstract>"

Five fighter pilots from the Swedish Air Force participated in the study, flying the same type of mission in a simulator and in real flight. Each pilot flew the same mission 3 times in the simulator and later 3 times in real flight. The pilots' heart rate, heart rate variability, and eye movements were continuously measured. Analyses of these data indicate that the pilots' psychophysiological reactions are very analogous in the simulator and in real flight.</abstract>"

The procedures these devices use to record these data vary a great deal. Some record the data in analog form, others in digital form, and others save only the interbeat intervals. With the variety of available devices the comparability of their resulting data needs to be verified for researchers to be confident of their results when sharing data among laboratories. Three ECG recording devices were compared using data collected from pilots during an approximately 60-min flight. The data were simultaneously recorded from the pilots by all 3 recorders. The results show that the devices provide essentially identical heart rate data.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Improving Rater Calibration in Aviation: A Case Study,"<title>Improving Rater Calibration in Aviation: A Case Study</title> <abstract>The assessment of pilot performance relies on systematic observation and assessment by a single trained rater or instructor/evaluator (I/E). Because of the importance of aviation safety, it is imperative that the rating and evaluation processes used by these I/Es yield reliable and valid data. This article describes a case study focused on improving the reliability and validity of crew assessment at a commercial carrier. The process for improving reliability involved the evaluation of current training methods, the construction and evaluation of 5 metrics for assessing inter-rater reliability, and a standardized process for using these metrics to train I/Es. A separate set of interventions was developed and implemented to improve structural validity. Data collected from 2 fleets in this airline during a 3-year period indicate aspects of reliability and validity that should be the focal points of continuing I/E training.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Measuring the Seat of the Pants: Commercial Airline Pilot Turbulence Assessments in a Full-Motion Simulator,"<title>Measuring the Seat of the Pants: Commercial Airline Pilot Turbulence Assessments in a Full-Motion Simulator</title> <abstract>There are significant costs associated with turbulence encounters; for example, turbulence can cause serious injuries for crew and passengers. These problems are exacerbated by the subjective and imprecise way in which turbulence is currently assessed and reported. To study this issue, 16 commercial airline pilots rated simulated turbulence in a full-motion Boeing 767-300ER simulator. We found interpilot variability in judgments of turbulence intensity. Compounding this issue was that pilots created nonstandard descriptions for turbulence. As these pilots, who fly the same aircraft type for one company, judged the same phenomena differently, we surmise that even larger differences will be found across other pilot populations.</abstract>"
2002,Netherlands,A Comparative Study of Psychophysiological Reactions During Simulator and Real Flight,"<title>A Comparative Study of Psychophysiological Reactions During Simulator and Real Flight</title> <abstract>During selection tests in a flight simulator and a real aircraft, physiological workload measures were evaluated. The selection context guaranteed high motivation in the participant to exert additional effort during difficult flight tasks. The aim of the study was to obtain information about the sensitivity to mental effort of several physiological measures and to explore the applicability of these measures in real flight. The following measures were used: heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration (frequency and amplitude), blood pressure, eye blinks (frequency, duration, and amplitude), and saliva cortisol. Blood pressure was the only measure that was difficult to obtain during real flights. All physiological measures showed large differences between baseline and flight tasks. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory frequency showed similar results in the simulator and real flight. Blink frequency showed an expected decrease during simulator flight, whereas a large increase was found during real flight. This can be partly explained by eye movements, which were made more frequently during real flight. Blink duration was shorter and amplitude was larger during both flights. This indicates that a combination of blink parameters provides better information about workload than blink frequency alone. Cortisol was not affected by the simulator flight, whereas greatly increased levels were found after the real flight. This indicates that cortisol is not affected by mental effort. G-forces during the real flight most likely caused the increased cortisol levels.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Ergavionics: Designing the Job of Flying an Airplane,"<title>Ergavionics: Designing the Job of Flying an Airplane</title> <abstract>Ergavionic principles governing the design and operation of an airplane cockpit were discovered through simulator and flight experiments starting during World War II and continuing through the 1970s, but their systematic application has not happened. These principles deal with control location and operation, display integration and pictorial realism, and control/display direction-of-motion relationships. Systematic application of these principles would make the job of flying an airplane so much easier and safer that hundreds of lives would be saved every year, and in the decades to come, thousands of lives.</abstract>"
2002,United States,The Reliability of Instructor Evaluations of Crew Performance: Good News and Not So Good News,"<title>The Reliability of Instructor Evaluations of Crew Performance: Good News and Not So Good News</title> <abstract>Two instructors rated the crew performance of helicopter crews (N = 45) who flew a simulated mission in a full-motion simulator. The instructors were given dimension training and behavior-observation training before the ratings. Before making their ratings, instructors completed an observation form as they watched videotapes of the crews and then completed a form that helped link behaviors to dimensions. For their ratings, instructors recorded or evaluated crew behaviors using 3 types of items: (a) specific crew behaviors in response to scenario events (e.g., whether the crew kept out of icing conditions), (b) evaluations of crew responses to scenario events (e.g., overall handling of the icing problem), and (c) crew resource management (CRM) dimensions for the entire scenario (e.g., evaluations of decision making). Results showed (a) both interjudge agreement and internal consistency were high for evaluations of crew responses to scenario events, (b) interjudge agreement was low but internal consistency was high on CRM items and scales, and (c) interjudge agreement was high but internal consistency was low for specific observable behaviors. The results for the evaluations of crew responses to scenario events were very encouraging and showed reliability over time and over crews. Suggestions for improving the reliability for the other 2 item types are provided.</abstract>"
2002,Norfolk Island - United States,Physiological Self-Regulation and Adaptive Automation,"<title>Physiological Self-Regulation and Adaptive Automation</title> <abstract>Adaptive automation has been proposed as a solution to current problems of human-automation interaction. Past research has shown the potential of this advanced form of automation to enhance pilot engagement and lower cognitive workload. However, there have been concerns voiced regarding issues, such as automation surprises, associated with the use of adaptive automation. This study examined the use of psychophysiological self-regulation training with adaptive automation that may help pilots deal with these problems through the enhancement of cognitive resource management skills. Eighteen participants were assigned to 3 groups (self-regulation training, false feedback, and control) and performed resource management, monitoring, and tracking tasks from the Multiple Attribute Task Battery. The tracking task was cycled between 3 levels of task difficulty (automatic, adaptive aiding, manual) on the basis of the electroencephalogram-derived engagement index. The other two tasks remained in automatic mode that had a single automation failure. Those participants who had received self-regulation training performed significantly better and reported lower National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores than participants in the false feedback and control groups. The theoretical and practical implications of these results for adaptive automation are discussed.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Heart Rate Measures of Flight Test and Evaluation,"<title>Heart Rate Measures of Flight Test and Evaluation</title> <abstract>One of the goals of aircraft test and evaluation is to determine whether the crew can operate a new system safely and effectively. Because flying is a complex task, several measures are required to derive the best evaluation. This article describes the use of heart rate to augment the typical performance and subjective measures used in test and evaluation. Heart rate can be nonintrusively collected and provides additional information to the test team. Example data illustrate the nature of the results provided by heart rate during the test and evaluation of a transport aircraft. Comparison with subjective workload estimates shows discrepancies that provide valuable insights into the crews' responses to the demands of the test missions. Heart rate should be considered as an additional measure in the test and evaluation tool kit.</abstract>"

The primary feature of the new interface involved replacing the strips with virtual tokens that were dynamically linked to their radar targets. In addition, an automated tool was developed that provided a tentative sequencing of the tokens. This experiment evaluated the automated sequencing tool. Utilization of the tool facilitated the development of the controllers' plans and reduced the workload of the tacticians who implemented the plan.</abstract>"

This model provides a means for examining individual instructor leniency or severity in ratings, difficulty of grade-sheet items, skill levels of flight crews, and interactions among these components. It was found that pilot instructor trainees differed in their levels of rating severity, and that higher crew resource management scores were easier to achieve than technical scores. Interaction analyses identified several pilot instructors who were evaluating crews in an unexpected manner, which is useful when providing feedback during training.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Landing Flare Accident Reports and Pilot Perception Analysis,"<title>Landing Flare Accident Reports and Pilot Perception Analysis</title> <abstract>This study examined flare accident rates and probable causes for improper flares. Measures included the analysis of 6,676 aircraft accident reports published by the National Transportation Safety Board and a 21-item perception questionnaire administered to 134 pilots with varying experience levels. The results revealed relatively high flare accident rates and showed that pilots believed the flare to be more difficult than 9 other standard flight maneuvers. The results also showed that pilots reported experience and instruction as the most important factors for proper flares. This study indicates that those factors are also probable causes for improper flatesand discusses how they relate to depth perception.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Improved Usability of Aviation Automation Through Direct Manipulation and Graphical User Interface Design,"<title>Improved Usability of Aviation Automation Through Direct Manipulation and Graphical User Interface Design</title> <abstract>Problems in advanced commercial aircraft pilot-flight management system (FMS) interaction through multifunction control display units (MCDUs) have been widely reported. Because this interaction plays an important role in ensuring aircraft safety, the MCDU should be designed to provide intuitive interfaces for ease of learning and use and to support pilot task performance in every aspect possible. Because of the increased complexity of computer-based systems, direct manipulation (DM) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been proposed as vehicles to facilitate user-friendly interface design for improved usability of computer-based systems. This article takes a systematic approach toward the usability analysis of MCDU design; specifically it considers the application of foundational usability principles to aviation automation. The properties and advantages of DM and GUI design are reviewed from the perspective of MCDU design. In addition, discussion is provided on a usability inspection conducted on the MCDU interface design by human factors professionals. After this, general human-computer interaction design guidelines and recommendations on aspects of DM and GUIs relevant to the interface of the MCDU are formulated on the basis of previous empirical or analytical studies. The implications of specific usability design principles on the MCDU design, as suggested in the literature and by the usability judges, are also discussed in the constrained context of FMS operations with specific examples detailing how principles could be achieved and used to address aviation automation issues.</abstract>"
2002,United States,Assessing and Improving Evaluation of Aircrew Performance,"<title>Assessing and Improving Evaluation of Aircrew Performance</title> <abstract>Evaluation of aircrew performance serves the critical functions of assessing the qualifications of individual pilots and, under newer proficiency-based training programs, providing data for modifying training programs. We apply psychometric methods to assessing and improving the quality of evaluation of aircrew performance. Quality evaluations require human judges to recognize and discriminate changes in performance levels (sensitivity) and map these observations onto the appropriate grade-scale values (accuracy). We define statistical measures for both of these properties. A distinction is made between referent-rater reliability (RRR) and traditional interrater reliability, and we argue that RRR more meaningfully measures evaluators' grading performance and has clearer training implications. We also discuss the implementation of training and calibration sessions that are intended to help improve evaluators' ratings of aircrew performance. We offer several practical guidelines for designing and conducting these sessions.</abstract>"
2002,Germany - United Kingdom,Developing a Method for Evaluating Crew Resource Management Skills: A European Perspective,"<title>Developing a Method for Evaluating Crew Resource Management Skills: A European Perspective</title> <abstract>The European Commission in conjunction with the European Joint Aviation Authorities (Human Factors Project Advisory Group) has been sponsoring a series of studies investigating a culturally robust method for the evaluation of pilots' nontechnical skills (NTS) for multicrew operations. This article outlines the development of a European NTS behavioral marker system for crew resource management evaluation called NOTECHS and presents preliminary results from an ongoing-test phase of this system (Joint Aviation Requirements Translation and Elaboration of Legislation [JARTEL]). The JARTEL project has involved 105 instructors from 14 European airlines who were given a short training session to use the NOTECHS system. After the training phase, these instructor pilots used the system to evaluate the individual CRM skills of captains and first officers in 8 different video scenarios filmed in a Boeing 757 simulator. Issues relating to rater training, reliability, and accuracy, as well as the instructors' opinions on the acceptability of the method, are discussed.</abstract>"
2002,Japan - United States,Improving Pilot/Air Traffic Control Voice Communication in General Aviation,"<title>Improving Pilot/Air Traffic Control Voice Communication in General Aviation</title> <abstract>The influence of the air traffic control (ATC) message format and message length was investigated on the ability of general aviation pilots to read back ATC instructions. While flying a simulator, 12 pilots heard altitude and radio frequency instructions spoken in grouped format (""forty-one-hundred""), and 12 heard them sequentially (""four-thousand-one-hundred""). Only limited evidence was found that grouped message format improved pilot memory. Specifically, pilots who received altitude and radio frequency instructions in the grouped, rather than the sequential, format produced fewer requests for clarification, especially for longer messages. Pilots were also more likely to read back the grouped instructions in sequential format, suggesting that prior experience with the sequential format influenced pilot communication involving the relatively novel grouped format in this study.</abstract>"
2002,United States,EEG Data Collected from Helicopter Pilots in Flight Are Sufficiently Sensitive to Detect Increased Fatigue From Sleep Deprivation,"<title>EEG Data Collected from Helicopter Pilots in Flight Are Sufficiently Sensitive to Detect Increased Fatigue From Sleep Deprivation</title> <abstract>This investigation determined whether the electroencephalographic (EEG) changes associated with sleep deprivation could be reliably recorded from aviators flying standardized maneuvers in an aircraft. In-flight EEG data were recorded from 10 UH-60 helicopter pilots who were kept awake for approximately 26 hr. In addition, resting EEGs and mood data were collected in the laboratory between flights. Results indicate that EEG theta activity, and to some extent delta activity, increases as a function of sleep deprivation in both settings. In addition, mood decrements were associated with the fatigue from sleep loss. These results indicate it is possible to monitor a pilot's general fatigue levels via the EEG without interfering with the primary duty of flying the aircraft.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Human error perspectives in aviation,"<title>Human error perspectives in aviation</title> <abstract>As aircraft have become more reliable, humans have played a progressively more important causal role in aviation accidents, resulting in the proliferation of human error frameworks and accident investigation schemes. To date, however, few efforts have been made to systematically organize these different approaches based on underlying theoretical similarities, and formalized methods for evaluating the utility of these multiple approaches have not been clearly defined. Many safety professionals, therefore, have been at a loss when choosing which error analysis and prevention approach to use within their organizations. As a result, those tasked with instituting human-centered safety programs often rely primarily on personal experience and intuition to address their needs. The purpose of this article is to help remedy this situation by providing safety practitioners with an overview of the prominent human error perspectives in aviation, as well as a set of objective criteria for evaluating human error frameworks.</abstract>"
2001,Australia - France,Distance estimation in a 3-D imaging display,"<title>Distance estimation in a 3-D imaging display</title> <abstract>Imaging displays have lacked several characteristics of direct vision such as true stereopsis, and this may in part account for some loss in visual performance when compared with direct vision. One such decrement in performance is in judgments of distance. An experiment is reported in which judgments of distance of targets were obtained from videotaped images of targets in a natural outdoor scene. Presentations were made under 3 conditions: stereo with near or far zero disparities and binocular nonstereo (""biocular"") viewing. Underconstancy was found to be less for stereo presentation, but only when the point of zero disparity was in the plane of presentation of the virtual image. Some implications for the design of cockpit imaging displays are discussed.</abstract>"

We prototyped a system that calculates and displays objective turbulence metrics. In a full motion simulator experiment, commercial airline pilots using objective turbulence metrics were able to provide significantly better passenger safety, flight attendant safety, and passenger comfort than those using the current convention. Pilots with displays of surrounding traffic's turbulence spent less time on the radio and made significantly better decisions with respect to passenger safety and passenger comfort than those relying on radio transmissions.</abstract>"

The results support the superiority of graphical over textual information display. Pilots were faster using the map display than using either of 2 text displays. In addition, pilots performed better using a north-up display than when using a track-up display. Discussion of the results focuses on recommendations for moving-map displays and the support of the nearest airport function within a navigational display.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Priority and organization of information accessed by pilots in various phases of flight,"<title>Priority and organization of information accessed by pilots in various phases of flight</title> <abstract>In 1 project, 27 pilots rated the priority of information required for flight. These pilots were divided by flight experience into novices (65-820 hrs) and experienced pilots (1,600 to 17,000 hrs). Participants rated 29 information elements across 7 phases of flight. These data show the shifting priorities of information across phases of flight, and some clear differences in priority assignments appeared between the novices and the experienced pilots. In another project, 34 pilots, some the same as before, participated in the collection of relatedness data for 231 pairs of information elements. Pathfinder analysis and hierarchical clustering were conducted showing connections among these elements and grouping of the elements. Pilot experience had little influence on the form of the network of associations. The discussion explores the potential of these data for instrumentation layout and integration of cockpit information systems, datalink design, and development of flight instruction curricula.</abstract>"

2001,United States,Implementing adaptive function allocation,"<title>Implementing adaptive function allocation</title> <abstract>Adaptive function allocation, in which the control of tasks dynamically shifts between humans and machines, has been proposed as an alternative to traditional static allocation, in which task control is assigned during system design and remains unchanged during operations. Understanding adaptive allocation and its effects on operator performance and workload is limited by sparse systematic research and an underdeveloped theoretical framework for implementation. The purpose of this research was to determine the efficacy of adaptive allocation by implementing adaptive allocation in a multiple task aviation simulation based on a taxonomy with facets of invocation philosophy and allocation strategy. Pilot performance was evaluated to determine benefits and costs for the implementation of adaptive allocation in a multitask aviation simulation with tracking, system monitoring, and target identification tasks. The results provide support for the implementation of adaptive allocation based on a hybrid model comprising elements of operator performance and mission relevant variables. Implementation of adaptive allocation was an effective countermeasure to the predictable decrease in tracking performance associated with the initial presentation of a surface target. Benefits were also identified for monitoring task performance despite the fact that the monitoring task was not modified by the implementation of automation. Secondary benefits included improved time estimates. Potential costs of adaptive allocation included performance variability in the tracking when task partitioning was the adaptive strategy. Implications of results for design, philosophy, and theory are presented.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Research and development toward automatic luminance control of electronic displays,"<title>Research and development toward automatic luminance control of electronic displays</title> <abstract>Electronic displays in military cockpits require adjustments of luminance as the ambient environment changes from daylight to night. An automatic luminance control for electronic cockpit displays could remove the unnecessary burden of manual display adjustment. This article discusses a research project that investigates the effects of forward field of view (FFOV) luminance and ambient illumination on luminance settings of a liquid crystal display. Forward-looking infrared radar sensor images and a grayscale pattern were presented to pilots. Pilots adapted to the FFOV luminance and were required to adjust the display luminance under various levels of ambient illumination until they could just see the target in the sensor image, or until they could see all 16 levels of the grayscale pattern. A regression analysis was performed and multiple linear regression models were created for both sensor and grayscale data. The models fit the data well, and the equation for sensor data can be used for the development of an algorithm to automatically control luminance. The results are compared with a Boeing automatic brightness control.</abstract>"
2001,United States,A framework for improving organizational learning through a user-adaptive intranet portal organizational memory information system,"<title>A framework for improving organizational learning through a user-adaptive intranet portal organizational memory information system</title> <abstract>An organizational memory information system (OMIS) is typically described in the literature as a support for an organization's ability to acquire and retain information regarding its processes (Harvey, Palmer, & Speier, 1997; Huber, 1991; Lehner, Maier, & Klosa, 1998; Stein & Zwass, 1995; Wijnhoven, 1998). Many OMISs have been developed, but they only partially support required capability. However, emerging technology, especially the Intranet portal, has the capacity to support an OMIS systematically and integrally. This article proposes an Intranet portal OMIS framework and several human-centered features for current Intranet portal navigation and retrieval functions. The proposed OMIS framework connects a general OMIS framework to characteristics of human cognition. The Intranet portal is analyzed as an OMIS identifying factor involved in information retrieval from personal memory and organizational memory. It considers more human cognitive aspects than current Intranet portals. Based on the background literature and technical aspects of Intranet portals, a conceptual model for navigation and retrieval functions in an Intranet portal is proposed. Three human-centered features are proposed in a conceptual model. The proposed frameworks and conceptual model could be used to guide the development of an OMIS and the adaptive interface design for the Intranet portal as an OMIS.</abstract>"
2001,United States,A theoretical analysis and preliminary investigation of dynamically adaptive interfaces,"<title>A theoretical analysis and preliminary investigation of dynamically adaptive interfaces</title> <abstract>A dynamically adaptive interface (DAI) is a computer interface that changes the display or control characteristics of a system (or both) in real time. The goal of DAIs is to anticipate informational needs or desires of the user and provide that information without the requirement of an explicit control input by the user. DAIs have the potential to improve overall human-machine system performance if properly designed; they also have a very real potential to degrade performance if they are not properly designed. This article explores both theoretical and practical issues in the design of DAIs. The relation of the DAI concept to decision aiding and automation is discussed, and a theoretical framework for design is outlined. A preliminary investigation of the DAI design concept was conducted in the domain of aviation (precision, low-level navigation). Nontraditional controls (a force reflecting stick) and displays (a configurai flight director) were developed to support performance at the task. A standard interface (conventional controls and displays), a candidate interface (alternative controls and displays), and an adaptive interface (dynamically alternating between the standard and candidate displays) were evaluated. The results indicate that significant performance advantages in the quality of route navigation were obtained with the candidate and adaptive interfaces relative to the standard interface; no significant differences between the candidate and adaptive interfaces were obtained. The implications of these results are discussed, with special emphasis on their relation to fundamental challenges that must be met for the DAI concept to be a viable design alternative.</abstract>"

Using a postal survey, opinions were elicited from 472 private and professional pilots concerning the effectiveness of various countermeasures to reduce the likelihood of drinking and flying. Punitive sanctions and tougher enforcement of the regulations were regarded as the most effective countermeasures, although offenders and professional pilots thought these actions less effective than private pilots and nonoffenders. The results are discussed with respect to producing effective countermeasures specifically targeted at high-risk groups.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Air traffic controller performance and workload under mature free flight: Conflict detection and resolution of aircraft self-separation,"<title>Air traffic controller performance and workload under mature free flight: Conflict detection and resolution of aircraft self-separation</title> <abstract>The effects of conflict detection and self-separating aircraft resolution on the mental workload and performance of en-route air traffic controllers were examined. An air traffic control simulator was used to manipulate traffic loads and traffic complexity. A mature stage of free flight was simulated by having controllers monitor self-separating aircraft. Four 30-min scenarios were created to combine moderate (11 aircraft) and heavy traffic loads (17 aircraft) in a 50-mile radius sector with the presence or absence of self-separating and conflicting aircraft. Conflicts (defined as a loss of separation of 5 nm laterally and 1,000 ft vertically) were indicated to the controller by the appearance of a red circle around each of the aircraft involved. A self-separation event was defined as an evasive maneuver (either altitude or speed change) made by 1 aircraft to avoid a potential conflict with another aircraft. Performance and workload measurements indicated that controllers had difficulty both in detecting conflicts and in recognizing self-separating events in a timely manner in saturated airspace. Controller mental workload also increased, as indexed both by subjective and secondary task measures. Implications for the design of automated tools to support controllers under free flight environments are discussed.</abstract>"

European regulators responsible for flight operations and flight crew licensing (Joint Aviation Authorities, 1996, 1997) are introducing requirements for the training and assessment of pilots' nontechnical skills. This article reports a review of the literature and a survey of current practice in the development and use of behavioral marker systems for training and assessing nontechnical CRM skills in international and domestic (UK) airlines. In general, there appears to be a wide range of practice in the design and implementation of behavioral markers systems within CRM programs. Emerging issues relating to content validity of marker systems and rater reliability are likely to become the focus of both researchers' and pilots' interest.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Head-up display symbology for ground collision avoidance,"<title>Head-up display symbology for ground collision avoidance</title> <abstract>Four ground collision avoidance displays were tested using a fixed-base T-38 simulator with a simulated head-up display. Twelve participants flew through 6 terrain encounters in each of the 4 display formats with 2 terrain profiles and 3 initial aircraft attitudes. The displays were: an X icon, depicted when projected altitude was below a given threshold; a chevron display that moved 2 triangular symbols laterally according to altitude; a mountain display that moved a single triangle symbol vertically based on altitude; and a highway display providing a preview, perspective depiction of terrain altitude, and a target altitude. When given the X-icon display, pilots were able to spend only 40% of the flight time at the desired altitude and crashed in 20% of the runs. The chevron and mountain symbols allowed 70% and 80% of the flight time to be spent at the desired altitude, respectively, and resulted in a crash in 8% of the runs. The highway depiction was the best display for the task, allowing over 90% of the time to be spent at the desired altitude with a crash rate of 2%.</abstract>"

Our vertical navigation displays reduced vertical flight technical error by as much as a factor of 2 without increasing workload. Relative advantages of the graphics formats are discussed.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Aircrews and automation bias: The advantages of teamwork?,"<title>Aircrews and automation bias: The advantages of teamwork?</title> <abstract>A series of recent studies on automation bias, the use of automation as a heuristic replacement for vigilant information seeking and processing, has investigated omission and commission errors in highly automated decision environments. Most of the research on this phenomenon has been conducted in a single-person performance configuration. This study was designed to follow up on that research to investigate whether the error rates found with single pilots and with teams of students would hold in the context of an aircraft cockpit, with a professional aircrew. In addition, this study also investigated the efficacy of possible interventions involving explicit automation bias training and display prompts to verify automated information. Results demonstrated the persistence of automation bias in crews compared with solo performers. No effects were found for either training or display prompts. Pilot performance during the experimental legs was most highly predicted by performance on the control leg and by event importance. The previously found phantom memory phenomenon associated with a false engine fire event persisted in crews.</abstract>"
2001,United States,Visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions: An empirical investigation of the possible causes,"<title>Visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions: An empirical investigation of the possible causes</title> <abstract>Pilots' decisions to continue or divert from a visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) were investigated using a dynamic simulation of a hypothetical cross-country flight. Differences in situation assessment, risk perception, and motivation between pilots who chose to continue or divert from a VFR flight into an IMC situation were examined. Results indicate that the simulation was successful in identifying pilots who would choose to either continue or divert and that differences existed between these two groups of pilots. Accuracy of visibility estimates, appraisal of one's own skill and judgment, and frequency of risk-taking behavior were most important in predicting whether a pilot would continue or divert the flight. Findings suggest that overconfidence in personal ability and inaccurate diagnoses of visibility conditions precipitate VFR flight into IMC. More research is needed, however, to identify effective methods for remedying these problems.</abstract>"
2000,United Kingdom,Civil aircraft warning systems: Future directions in information management and presentation,"<title>Civil aircraft warning systems: Future directions in information management and presentation</title> <abstract>Aviation statistics often cite human error and, in particular, crew decision making as a primary cause in explanations of aircraft accidents and incidents. Part of the solution to managing error may lie in the development of human-centered flight deck warning systems, which not only are error tolerant but also actively aid crew decision making. This article describes some of the findings from a comprehensive questionnaire survey of civil flight deck crew carried out to locate user requirements for the next generation of warning systems. Because the participants in the study were from 10 different fleets (thus representing a range of warning systems from the older fixed static systems to the modern multifunction ones), it is possible to consider whether the development of warning systems has been successful from the point of view of the user. Pilot views on the provision of earlier detection of abnormal conditions, the completeness of warning information, the consequences of crew actions, the prioritization of warning information, and the facility to interrogate the system to make predictions are reported. It is concluded that warning systems have developed in accordance with crew opinion and that given the prevalence of human error on the flight deck, issues of information management and presentation in the next generation of warning systems will be of paramount importance. Working closely with crew provides one means of helping to ensure the good design of future systems.</abstract>"

In modern cockpits there are more sources of dynamic information than any single pilot has the ability to attend to, let alone comprehend, all at once. As technological developments lead to the deployment of new weapons systems, the future aerial battlefield will inevitably yield increased levels of complexity. A significant challenge for cockpit designers is to devise pilot-vehicle interfaces that take full advantage of the parallel information extraction capabilities of humans through the use of integrated multisensory displays. This article describes an approach to multisensory display development that uses human performance evaluations as a design tool, and concludes with a description of a multisensory crew station designed by an interdisciplinary team.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Tactical displays for combat awareness: An examination of dimensionality and frame of reference concepts and the application of cognitive engineering,"<title>Tactical displays for combat awareness: An examination of dimensionality and frame of reference concepts and the application of cognitive engineering</title> <abstract>Three prototype displays are contrasted for aircraft navigation and tactical hazard awareness: a conventional 2-D coplanar display, an exocentric (God's eye) 3-D display, and an immersed (pilot's eye) 3-D display coupled with a small scale global display. Strengths and weaknesses of each display type are discussed, related particularly to the ambiguity of perspective displays and to attention allocation problems with dual-display suites. In Experiment 1, 8 pilots flew with each of the displays around an airspace populated by waypoints, hazards, and traffic. Performance measures revealed the anticipated costs and benefits of each display type. In Experiment 2, cognitive engineering techniques of performance and cognitive task analysis were applied to remediate the weaknesses of each display type. Emphasis was placed on display enhancements to resolve 3-D ambiguity and visual momentum and cueing techniques to facilitate attention allocation and switching. Analysis of performance of 27 additional participants in flight path tracking and hazard awareness measures revealed success in application of the cognitive engineering principles, greatly attenuating the weaknesses of each display.</abstract>"
2000,United States,The need for multisensory interfaces in support of effective attention allocation in highly dynamic event-driven domains: The case of cockpit automation,"<title>The need for multisensory interfaces in support of effective attention allocation in highly dynamic event-driven domains: The case of cockpit automation</title> <abstract>In a variety of domains, automation technology has evolved from passive tools to highly autonomous agents that can initiate actions independent of user input and without explicit operator consent. This evolution brings with it an increased need for effective human-automation communication and coordination to ensure that both agents stay informed about each others' goals, activities, and limitations. Yet, most modern systems are not equipped with the skills required to contribute effectively and in a timely manner to the exchange of information on commitments and actions. In particular, systems fail to provide external attentional guidance to their operators in the case of uncommanded changes and events, which can lead to automation surprises and, sometimes, incidents and accidents. To a large extent, these problems can be explained by designers' increasing reliance on automation feedback that requires focal visual attention. This article explores the potential of multisensory displays to better support attentional guidance in multidisplay environments and to allow for parallel processing of the considerable amount of information that is available in many complex dynamic domains such as the modern flight deck.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Helmet-mounted display symbology for terrain avoidance during low-level maneuvers,"<title>Helmet-mounted display symbology for terrain avoidance during low-level maneuvers</title> <abstract>A simulation study was performed to evaluate helmet-mounted display symbology for fighter aircraft ground collision avoidance systems. Four visual alert symbologies were tested: an iconic cue, an aircraft-fixed (AF) guidance cue, a head-fixed (HF) guidance cue, and an HF guidance cue with a pitch ladder. Participants were given audio and visual side tasks and responded to alerts in different aircraft attitudes. Shorter reaction times were observed when a HF visual alert was given in addition to the standard audio alert. No significant differences in recovery performance (measured by response time and altitude loss) were observed between display formats. However, the display format had a significant effect on participant head motion. With HF guidance cues, pilots were able to perform the recovery maneuver with their heads off axis; with AF guidance cues or no guidance cues, pilots consistently turned their heads to face forward before maneuvering the aircraft.</abstract>"
2000,Netherlands,Culture and flight safety in military aviation,"<title>Culture and flight safety in military aviation</title> <abstract>This article presents the results of a study into military aviation accidents using data on total losses per 10,000 flying hours for 14 NATO air forces. Compared to national cultural scores, as found by Hofstede (1984, 1991), significant relations evolved among accident rates, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance. These relations were also found when controlled for the contribution of technical failures as a cause of the accidents. These findings support earlier findings of this type in civilian air traffic. This article ends with recommendations to deal with the impact of cultural dimensions on flight safety in military aviation.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Error types and related error detection mechanisms in the aviation domain: An analysis of aviation safety reporting system incident reports,"<title>Error types and related error detection mechanisms in the aviation domain: An analysis of aviation safety reporting system incident reports</title> <abstract>Human error is considered a contributing factor in 70% to 80% of all aviation accidents. Because errors can never be eliminated completely, a further reduction of the already low accident rate in this domain will require investments in better support for error management. In particular, a better understanding of the nature and effectiveness of error detection mechanisms is needed. With this goal in mind, NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System incident reports were analyzed in terms of the formal characteristics of underlying errors, the cognitive stage, and the performance level at which these errors occurred, and with respect to the processes that led to their detection and, thus, prevented these incidents from turning into accidents. The majority of incidents involved lapses (i.e., failures to perform a required action) or mistakes, such as errors in intention formation and strategy choice. These errors were most often detected based on routine checks and the observed outcome of an action, respectively. Most slips appear to have been discovered by the crew before they could lead to a problem worth reporting. Our findings suggest a need for more effective feedback in support of data-driven monitoring, especially in the case of errors of omission and for shared knowledge of intent between airborne and ground-based operators to promote the more timely and reliable detection of mistakes.</abstract>"
2000,Netherlands,The effects of pictorial detail on the timing of the landing flare: Results of a visual simulation experiment,"<title>The effects of pictorial detail on the timing of the landing flare: Results of a visual simulation experiment</title> <abstract>Artificial outside-world displays currently used in flight simulators may, in the future, also be applied to aircraft cockpits to enhance vision or to provide a completely synthetic replacement. In both cases, a very important question for designers of such displays is which elements of pictorial detail in the presented image are needed for satisfactory task or mission performance. Two elements of pictorial detail, a visible runway outline and ground texture, are considered in this article. An experiment is described in which the participants were required to initiate the landing maneuver during a simplified aircraft-landing task. This experiment was developed with 2 goals in mind: The first objective was to determine whether performance was influenced by the addition of ground texture; a second objective was to find out whether participants based their timing of the initiation of the landing maneuver on altitude perception or on the so-called time-to-contact (TTC; Lee, 1974). In the landing case, TTC is defined as the time remaining to the moment that the wheels make contact with the runway if no pilot action is taken. The results of the experiment show that landing performance is improved when ground texture is added to the display. The results also suggest that participants change their timing behavior from a strategy based on altitude perception when only a runway outline is present, to one based on TTC perception when texture is added to the display.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Automation bias and errors: Are crews better than individuals?,"<title>Automation bias and errors: Are crews better than individuals?</title> <abstract>The availability of automated decision aids can sometimes feed into the general human tendency to travel the road of least cognitive effort. Is this tendency toward ""automation bias"" (the use of automation as a heuristic replacement for vigilant information seeking and processing) ameliorated when more than one decision maker is monitoring system events? This study examined automation bias in two-person crews versus solo performers under varying instruction conditions. Training that focused on automation bias and associated errors successfully reduced commission, but not omission, errors. Teams and solo performers were equally likely to fail to respond to system irregularities or events when automated devices failed to indicate them, and to incorrectly follow automated directives when they contradicted other system infor-mation.</abstract>"

Finding accommodations will be of particular concern for occupations such as airline pilot, in which small errors may result in fatal accidents. This study examined the perceived performance of older pilots, if information on ergonomic redesign interventions had a significant effect on attitudes toward ergonomic redesign interventions for older pilots, and how perceived performance and type of information interacted to affect attitudes toward ergonomic redesign interventions for older pilots. Participants in the study included 147 flight instructors and 24 student pilots. Results and implications for future research are discussed.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Automation management strategies: Pilot preferences and operational experiences,"<title>Automation management strategies: Pilot preferences and operational experiences</title> <abstract>With the evolution of technology from passive tool to highly independent agent, it is becoming increasingly important to support operators in coordinating human and machine intentions and actions. One way to achieve this goal is the context-sensitive use and implementation of different automation management strategies. This study examined pilots' preferences for and their operational experiences with 3 different strategies - management-by-consent, management-by-exception, and full automation. Pilots expressed a strong preference for management-by-consent in which the automation cannot take action unless explicit pilot consent has been received. High time pressure, high workload, and low task criticality led to a shift in pilots' preferences toward management-by-exception in which the automation can initiate actions on its own. These preferences can be explained, in part, by pilots' operational experiences with existing cockpit systems that illustrate that human-machine coordination is a complex process involving the negotiation of multiple goals, activities, and strategies rather than simply assuming manual control in case of disagreements.</abstract>"
2000,United States,Display effects on shaping apparent strategy: A case study in collision detection and avoidance,"<title>Display effects on shaping apparent strategy: A case study in collision detection and avoidance</title> <abstract>This article examines participants' behavior at collision detection and avoidance during parallel approaches and tests how it is affected by additional information on traffic displays. Participant behavior is analyzed by looking for ""apparent strategies,"" measured by characteristics of participants' actions that remain consistent across scenar-ios with strongly different dynamics. The participants' collision detection reactions are found to occur at aircraft lateral separations that are consistent across a variety of scenarios; likewise, collision avoidance maneuvers with a ""turn-away"" component are consistently chosen for all scenarios. Unfortunately, these apparent strategies do not have adequate performance. Although some statistically significant differences in measures of participant behavior were found between display conditions, they were not substantial enough to increase performance.</abstract>"

2000,United States,Facilitating LOFT debriefings: Instructor techniques and crew participation,"<title>Facilitating LOFT debriefings: Instructor techniques and crew participation</title> <abstract>This study analyzes techniques instructor pilots (IPs) use to facilitate crew analysis and evaluation of line-oriented flight training performance. We analyzed IP facilitation and crew participation for 36 debriefing sessions conducted at 5 U.S. airlines. For this analysis we developed a rating instrument termed the Debriefing Assessment Battery and demonstrated that it can be used reliably. IP facilitation skill varied dramatically, suggesting a need for concrete hands-on training in facilitation techniques. All measures of crew participation correlated significantly with IP effectiveness in facilitation. Crews responded to IP guidance but did not lead their own debriefings. We suggest ways to improve debriefing effectiveness.</abstract>"

A sample of 141 test pilots completed a structured assessment of their aircraft's handling qualities in 7 common flight maneuvers. From a series of confirmatory factor analyses, 5 stable dimensions of aircraft handling qualities were elicited. Further multiple regressions with these 5 dimensions as predictor variables indicated a highly significant relation with Cooper-Harper ratings, however, the significant predictors varied with the nature of the flight task. To conclude, a brief description of a prototype multidimensional handling qualities rating scale based on these results is provided.</abstract>"
2000,Australia,An analysis of slant for guidance of landing approaches,"<title>An analysis of slant for guidance of landing approaches</title> <abstract>For landing without visual aids, judgment of slant angle from texture gradients may be the primary strategy used by pilots to maintain a constant angle of descent toward a runway aimpoint. A mathematical analysis was undertaken to assess whether 1 or more of the available texture gradients have the properties required to support this strategy. The analysis revealed that texture gradients in themselves could not be useful. A relative gradient proportionalized against size of texture elements could, however, support descent-path control. Although not mathematically invariant, the departures from invariance of these relative gradients are too small to be functionally significant. In addition, relative gradients are sensitive to minimum functionally significant changes in angle of descent, whereas absolute gradients are not. Thus, relative gradients satisfy the formal requirements of an invariant for control of action.</abstract>"
2000,Sweden,Sharing the burden of flight deck automation training,"<title>Sharing the burden of flight deck automation training</title> <abstract>Flight deck automation has generated new training requirements, most of which have been absorbed by in-house airline training, in particular, aircraft transition training. This leaves little room for learning about how human roles have shifted in automated cockpits or how the distinction between technical and nontechnical skills has become blurred when managing the flight path of an automated aircraft. This article explores how overall pilot training quality, efficiency, and effectiveness would benefit from pulling automation training forward into the pilot training curriculum, reducing the burden carried mainly by transition training today. This article examines various stages of pilot training (including ab initio, multicrew cooperation, and crew resource management training) and lays out the opportunities and obstacles they contain for the integration of flight deck automation. In conclusion, airlines themselves can play a constructive role by specifying what kinds of automation learning requirements earlier pilot training stages should cover, and by sharing their automation philosophies and actively taking part in the design of the preairline training. Such participation from an airline can help achieve appropriate knowledge and attitudes toward automation among its future pilots.</abstract>"
1999,Canada,Designing functional visualizations for aircraft systems status displays,"<title>Designing functional visualizations for aircraft systems status displays</title> <abstract>A number of researchers have observed that glass cockpit displays tend to be opaque and that this makes it difficult for the flight crew to develop accurate and comprehensive mental models of system functioning, thereby leading to errors in abnormal situations. However, few researchers have suggested how to create better functional visualizations of system behavior, and even fewer have provided examples of what such advanced displays might look like. This article describes how the principles of ecological interface design (EID), a framework developed in the context of process control, can be applied in aviation to design engineering systems status displays. A prototype EID interface for the fuel and engines of a Lockheed Hercules C-130 Model E-H aircraft was constructed using the VAPS prototyping tool. This study shows, for the first time, that EID can be meaningfully applied to aviation.</abstract>"

This system produces a procedural change by modifying the way pilots and air traffic controllers interact. During the last 10 years, many studies have sought to understand and improve pilots' activities and the relationships among controllers and pilots. This article presents the salient advantages and drawbacks of such a system for pilots along several dimensions: air-ground and intracockpit communication, party line and situational awareness, and human-machine interaction. It also suggests areas that require more work to remove or reduce the main drawbacks.</abstract>"

1999,United States,"The ""outside-in"" attitude display concept revisited","<title>The ""outside-in"" attitude display concept revisited</title> <abstract>The ""outside-in"" attitude display concept, which includes a moving-aircraft (as opposed to a moving-horizon) attitude reference, dates back to the early days of flying. The majority of the laboratory and in-flight studies that have evaluated the outside-in format over the years have found it to be superior at preventing roll-reversal errors during normal flying and in recovering from unusual attitudes. Although outside-in attitude displays have been, and continue to be, flown throughout the world, the majority of military and civilian aircraft have failed to adopt this format. This article reviews the purported advantages and disadvantages of outside-in displays, presents a neuropsychological explanation for their general superiority in maintaining spatial orientation, and describes 3 new situations (off-axis helmet-mounted display viewing, global situation displays, and control of uninhabited aerial vehicles) for which the outside-in concept appears to be ideally suited.</abstract>"
1999,United States,Development and evaluation of a background attitude indicator,"<title>Development and evaluation of a background attitude indicator</title> <abstract>In this article, we describe a series of 3 studies conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using a unique type of attitude indicator, called a background attitude indicator (BAI), to recover from unusual attitudes. The BAI is a head-down display format that combines tactical information in the central portion of the display with attitude information in the border surrounding the tactical information. The attitude information, in essence, frames the tactics display. The results of thp 3 studies showed that BAIs in general are capable of portraying enough attitude information to enable pilots to recover from unusual attitudes. Specifically, BAIs being used for unusual attitude recovery tasks should contain continuous flow patterns that allow pilots to determine approximate attitude (pitch) quickly.</abstract>"
1999,United States,Response predispositions and piloting safety,"<title>Response predispositions and piloting safety</title> <abstract>Aviation safety requires optimization of the human-machine interaction. Although the machine brings great reliability and consistency, human survival has depended on behavioral diversity and ability to adapt to the unexpected. The two approaches, reliability and adaptability, complement each other, but only if the human brings the right adaptive responses to the human-machine interaction. In this article, we identify pilot response predispositions that contribute to safe flying and report on the development of a 132-item, 16-scale Pilot Response Predisposition Inventory (PRPI). The scales were validated against two different groups of pilots. The results support the validity of the instrument for research, for pilot counseling, and perhaps for some selection purposes. Use of the instrument to deny or suspend licensure or to make similar administrative or personalized decisions is not recommended.</abstract>"

A 25-item questionnaire was designed and completed by a sample of 70 pilots in the Australian general aviation industry. The data analysis involved considerations of internal reliability and concurrent validity, in addition to comparisons between experience levels and attendance at human factors seminars. The results suggest that the questionnaire has a level of reliability and validity for the analysis of attitudes toward unsafe acts within the Australian general aviation industry. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the development and evaluation of human factors training strategies within the general aviation environment.</abstract>"

Results indicated that use of the tabular, text-only format normally found on such displays was significantly slower and less accurate than either a map display of nearest airport information or a text display that included an orientation symbol. Additionally, pilots ignored information from the heading indicator, focusing on the GPS to perform the task. Discussion focuses on the need to support pilot decision making.</abstract>"

In the experiment reported here, a commercially available PCATD was evaluated for its transfer effectiveness for teaching of instrument flight skills. Students from the beginning and advanced instrument courses at the University of Illinois were trained to criterion in the PCATD on a wide range of tasks and were then retrained to criterion in the airplane on the same tasks. Other students were trained to criterion on the same tasks only in the airplane. Comparisons of trials to criterion in the airplane for the 2 groups, their times to complete each flight lesson in the airplane, and their course completion times were used to assess the training effectiveness of the PCATD. Transfer savings were generally positive and substantial when new tasks were introduced but low when tasks already learned in previous lessons were reviewed. A comparison of course completion times showed savings of 3.9 hr in the airplane for the PCATD group compared to the airplane-control group.</abstract>"
1999,United States,The use of autonomic components to improve cardiovascular assessment of mental workload in flight simulation,"<title>The use of autonomic components to improve cardiovascular assessment of mental workload in flight simulation</title> <abstract>Principal components analysis of multiple psychophysiological measures of cardiovascular activity was used to derive the underlying sympathetic and parasympathetic information needed to represent the autonomic space for heart period. This method was applied to cardiac data that were previously collected during a full-mission flight simulation from volunteer commercial pilots (Corwin et al., 1989). Pilots flew both low-and high-workload mission scenarios in 2 separate test sessions. The autonomic components provided increased diagnosticity regarding the autonomic mode of control for heart period change between scenarios and across flight phases. Heart period was shorter (faster heart rate) during the high-than low-workload scenario because of uncoupled sympathetic activation. Heart period change across flight phases was due primarily to coupled reciprocal modes of autonomic control during the low-workload scenario. However, heart period change across phases was due to multiple modes of control, including coactivation, during the high-workload scenario. Further, heart period and the Sympathetic component score were significantly reliable across test sessions.</abstract>"

An examination of current aircraft automation and automation-related training and operations strongly suggests that a major factor in this situation is the lack of adequate systems engineering in the automation development process. An examination of contemporary commercial aircraft systems under guidelines developed in the systems engineering process for an early military terrain-following system reveals weaknesses in the design of the commercial systems. Commercial aviation could benefit substantially from more extensive use of proven systems engineering practices.</abstract>
1999,Australia,Work domain analysis for training-system definition and acquisition,"<title>Work domain analysis for training-system definition and acquisition</title> <abstract>Training-needs analysis is critical for defining and procuring effective training systems. However, traditional approaches to training-needs analysis are not suitable for capturing the demands of highly automated and computerized work domains. In this article, we propose that work domain analysis can identify the functional structure of a work domain that must be captured in a training system, so that workers can be trained to deal with unpredictable contingencies that cannot be handled by computer systems. To illustrate this argument, we outline a work domain analysis of a fighter aircraft that defines its functional structure in terms of its training objectives, measures of performance, basic training functions, physical functionality, and physical context. The functional structure or training needs identified by work domain analysis can then be used as a basis for developing functional specifications for training systems, specifically its design objectives, data collection capabilities, scenario generation capabilities, physical functionality, and physical attributes. Finally, work domain analysis also provides a useful framework for evaluating whether a tendered solution fulfills the training needs of a work domain.</abstract>"

1999,United States,Automation in general aviation: Two studies of pilot responses to autopilot malfunctions,"<title>Automation in general aviation: Two studies of pilot responses to autopilot malfunctions</title> <abstract>Study 1 examined 4 automation-related malfunctions (runaway pitch trim up, roll servo failure, roll sensor failure, pitch drift up) and subsequent pilot responses. Study 2 examined 4 additional malfunctions, 2 more immediately obvious (runaway pitch trim down, runaway roll servo) and 2 more subtle (failed attitude indicator, pitch sensor drift down) than those in Study 1, and the effect of an auditory warning. Data collection was performed in the Civil Aeromedical Institute's Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator, configured as a Piper Malibu. Results suggest that maladaptive responses to some of these failures may, in a significant percentage of cases, lead to significant altitude loss, overstress of the airframe, disorientation of the pilot, or destruction of the aircraft. Percentages of successful recoveries, detection and correction times, and related indexes of performance are discussed in the context of malfunction type, flight profile, and auditory alerts.</abstract>"
1999,United States,The development of specifications for an automated monitoring system interface associated with aircraft condition,"<title>The development of specifications for an automated monitoring system interface associated with aircraft condition</title> <abstract>Because of the complexity and interconnectedness of aircraft subsystems, considerable interpretation is required to determine the implications of conventional system warnings and to decide on the appropriate course of action to ameliorate a fault condition. This article focuses on the case of mechanical fault conditions in rotorcraft. Until recently, only a few simple sensors (e.g., oil pressure and temperature, oil debris sensor) were provided to signal mechanical faults. However, a variety of new sensors and analyzers have become available recently, under the general rubric of health and usage monitoring systems, which purport to provide more sensitive identifications of faults along with the promise of future extensions to fault diagnosis and prognosis as well. A motion-based simulator was used to gather performance data associated with air crew responses to a variety of mechanical faults using current cockpit instrumentation. Participants were then interviewed regarding their information requirements for using new diagnostic systems to mitigate in-flight mechanical system emergencies. Results gave initial support for a taxonomy of air crew cognitive activities. This classification scheme is being used in ongoing work to design and evaluate information aids for rotorcraft air crews.</abstract>"

Data were obtained from 1 model of the B737-200 and 2 models of the B737-300. The B737-200 had an advanced autopilot and traditional instruments. The 2 B737-300 models had flight management computers, and the most advanced model, the B737-300e, had electronic flight instrument system displays. Twenty crews were observed during 90 legs of revenue flying. Analyses were conducted on the proportion of time at least 1 pilot looked out of the cockpit. The results showed that the presence of flight management computers affected the amount of time spent looking outside only for landings, with pilots looking out more in the B737-200s than in the B737-300s. The presence of electronic flight instrument system displays did not affect the amount of time pilots spent looking outside.</abstract>"

We focus our discussion on the features of the control system that lead to mode confusion and error. We first provide working definitions of the term mode and discuss key constructs that contribute to mode error, such as mode ambiguity and user expectations. Following this, we discuss human interaction with automated control systems in general and cockpit automation in particular. To provide a formal description of human interaction with such control systems, we introduce a modeling language, Statecharts, which is used by system engineers to specify complex control systems. We use the Statecharts language to describe the 3 types of modes that are commonly found in modern control systems: interface, functional, and supervisory modes. Examples from cockpit automation are used to illustrate each type of mode. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the links between the mode constructs and formal representation of human interaction with control systems.</abstract>"
1999,Australia - United States,Functional interface design for the modern aircraft cockpit,"<title>Functional interface design for the modern aircraft cockpit</title> <abstract>There is an emerging concern that modern glass cockpits induce information overload. This is sometimes thought to be an inevitable result of the increased complexity and the need for automation that accompanies the transition to high technology. We argue here that the human performance problems created by glass cockpits are not an inevitable consequence of increased hardware complexity or of automation but, instead, are a result of nonfunctional design that increases complexity at the cockpit interface. The essential danger with computerized interfaces is that many physical design constraints are removed and designers are permitted unheralded opportunities for new information and control formats. Low technology forces the use of functional properties at the interface, but computer technology does not. On the other hand, computer technology does not preclude functional design. Computer technology may offer far broader opportunities for functional design by releasing designers from many physical constraints. In this article, we explain the concept of functional interface design and outline how it might enable the use of high technology and automation in the service of robust and cognitively economical action in an aircraft cockpit.</abstract>"

Ten expert controllers were involved in a full-scope simulation study, and displacements of flight strips were analyzed as a function of the controller and as a function of the role these motor acts have in indicating problem detection, monitoring the ongoing resolution, or sending the aircraft to other control positions. Task analysis assumptions related to the ongoing resolution and to the end of problems were confirmed. But contrary to task analysis assumptions, results reveal that conflict situations are detected by the radar controller. In line with previous field observations, this striking result raises a serious problem about the validity of the putative anticipatory role attributed to the planning controller.</abstract>"

Furthermore, an experiment was performed to test which FMA type produces the best comprehension of flight modes. The results of this experiment showed no advantage for either FMA type.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Evidence for the validity of PC-based simulations in studying aircrew coordination,"<title>Evidence for the validity of PC-based simulations in studying aircrew coordination</title> <abstract>Recently, advances in computer technology have allowed the use of PC-based simulations for a variety of aviation training and research purposes. One area in particular where PC-based simulations have been used extensively is the study of aircrew coordination. Yet, there have always been lingering questions about the validity of these simulations. Critics have argued that most PC-based simulations are derived from video games and that gaming cannot substitute for actual work tasks. Also, the low physical fidelity of these devices has been cited as a potential threat to validity. By reviewing a number of aircrew studies conducted over the past 10 years and by presenting new experimental results, this article provides evidence for the validity of using PC-based simulations. Additionally, this article provides a set of guidelines that can be used by practitioners to increase the validity of their simulations.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Event-based approach to training (EBAT),"<title>Event-based approach to training (EBAT)</title> <abstract>The importance of providing real-world experience through virtual environments is well accepted, and this mode of training is used extensively in aviation. It is, therefore, surprising that there are few general methods that guide the design of simulation-based training. The lack of such methods is problematic. Due to recent factors in the aviation industry, such as advances in technology, individuals must now possess a range of skills, increasingly cognitive in nature, that must be trained and evaluated through hands-on experience. Second, training is broadening from an almost exclusive focus on individuals and teams to include multiple crews. It is clear that exercise design methodologies are needed. The purpose of this article is to describe a general approach to the design of simulation-based exercises referred to as the Event-Based Approach to Training (EBAT). Event-based techniques guide the design of training opportunities by systematically identifying and introducing events within training exercises that provide known opportunities to observe behaviors of interest. With EBAT, explicit links are maintained between training objectives, exercise design, and performance assessment. We also discuss several recent applications and address potential new areas that may benefit from its application.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Personal computer-based flight training devices,"<title>Personal computer-based flight training devices</title> <abstract>This article reviews the role of personal computer aviation training devices (PCATDs) in general aviation pilot training. A brief history of flight simulator development is provided, accompanied by a sampling of early research on the effectiveness of simulator training. PCATDs are described along with their more common interface devices. Next, an examination of the use of PC-based flight simulators in formal and informal flight training programs reveals some of the recent data validating their use. Special emphasis is paid to the use of PC-based flight simulators for the instruction of novices in how to fly and the training of pilots in the performance of instrument flight maneuvers. Then, the role fidelity plays in producing transfer from PC-based training devices is addressed. Finally, a case is made for researchers to provide the kind of data that regulatory agencies should use in determining the standards for certification of PCATDs in flight training programs. Finally, suggestions are made for improvement of future PC-based flight training devices.</abstract>"
1998,United Kingdom,Computer-based simulation as an adjunct to Ab initio flight training,"<title>Computer-based simulation as an adjunct to Ab initio flight training</title> <abstract>Two groups of ab initio student pilots were given training on a flight simulation package running on a desk-top computer prior to performing some basic flight maneuvers in the air. One group interacted with the computer using a representative set of flight controls. The other group used only the computer's cursor and function keys. Both groups exhibited superior performance compared to a control group who had no computer-based training. Students with prior training who used representative flight controls also experienced lower in-flight workload. The results suggest that PC-based flight simulators do not aid in the psychomotor skills required to fly a light aircraft. Their benefits lie elsewhere. However, even very low levels of simulator fidelity can be beneficial in the initial stages of pilot training.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Evaluating the effectiveness of flight simulators for training combat skills: A review,"<title>Evaluating the effectiveness of flight simulators for training combat skills: A review</title> <abstract>The military is focusing a great deal of effort on developing virtual world technologies that will allow training combat skills in flight simulators. Considerably less attention is being directed toward documenting the effectiveness of such training. In this article, we review Air Force and Navy efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of training the combat skills necessary for attack and fighter aircraft in flight simulators. The majority of these efforts indicate that simulation can be a valuable complement to the aircraft. Unfortunately, this conclusion is based primarily on opinion data from experienced aviators. There are very few transfer of training experiments, and those experiments have examined only a limited set of combat tasks. We also describe the typical paradigms used to conduct training evaluations and outline a multistep evaluation program for determining training effectiveness.</abstract>"
1998,United States,Simulator platform motion - The need revisited,"<title>Simulator platform motion - The need revisited</title> <abstract>The need to provide increased access to flight simulator training for U.S. regional airlines, which historically have been limited by cost considerations in the use of such equipment for pilot recurrent training, is discussed in this article. In light of that need, the issue of whether more affordable fixed-base simulators, identical to full flight simulators in all respects except for absence of platform motion, might provide an equivalent level of safety when employed for recurrent training is examined. Pertinent literature from the past 2 decades is reviewed. The article observes that no definitive conclusion can be drawn that would warrant modification of current qualification requirements for platform motion in full flight simulators. The article concludes that this situation will remain unchanged unless new research is undertaken, which takes into account the lessons learned from past research, and the opportunities engendered by new technology. Broad guidelines for an appropriate research design are discussed.</abstract>"

Volunteer participants (student naval aviators) were tested on a series of cognitive and perceptual psychomotor tests. The participants then entered the Navy's flight training program at Whiting Field, Florida. Participants' flight grades were obtained at the end of primary training. Multiple-regression and artificial neural network procedures were evaluated to determine their relative efficiency in predicting flight grade training performance.</abstract>"
1998,United States,En route operational errors and situation awareness,"<title>En route operational errors and situation awareness</title> <abstract>En route operational errors that occurred during 1993 were analyzed to determine if controllers who were aware that an error was developing differed from unaware controllers in the type and severity of errors they made. Neither the personnel nor the air traffic situation distinguished ""aware"" from ""unaware"" controllers. However, unaware controllers were more likely to commit certain technical and cognitive mistakes. In addition to differing in the types of mistakes they made, unaware controllers were involved in more severe operational errors. This difference in severity was eliminated, however, when the groups were equated on the frequency with which technical and cognitive errors were made.</abstract>"
1998,Australia,A mathematical model of glide-slope perception in the visual approach to landing,"<title>A mathematical model of glide-slope perception in the visual approach to landing</title> <abstract>A mathematical model of glide-slope perception is presented for the visual approach to landing when there is a visually impoverished scene. The perceptual process has been modeled as the weighted average of the geometric relations in the scene that provide glide-slope information, with weights being adjusted during the approach to minimize the uncertainty in glide-slope perception. The model suggests that the optimum combination of relations providing glide-slope information is dependent on the range from the runway threshold and that there is a relation between the handling qualities of aircraft or flight simulators and the adjustment of the weights.</abstract>"

In this article, the interaction in the cockpit is analyzed as a game whose goal is flight safety. The crew members are involved in interactions that determine the extent of their utility. It is demonstrated that adhering to SOP leads to maximum utility and, thus, to greater flight safety than deviating from it, even if an alternative procedure is equivalent as far as safety is concerned or seems to lead to greater utility.</abstract>"

In Phase 1 of the study, 12 participants completed a series of simulated flights and provided Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) ratings of workload and Situational Awareness Rating Technique (SART) ratings of situational awareness. In Phase 2, computer models of the combat mission were constructed using the Micro Saint modeling tool. The visual, auditory, kinesthetic, cognitive, and psychomotor components of workload associated with each task comprising the mission were estimated and used to derive measures of average and peak workload. The results from the flight-simulator data versus the Micro Saint data were similar but not identical, indicating that the computer models were partially but not completely valid predictors of mental workload and situational awareness. The computer modeling appeared to be a more effective predictor of situational awareness than mental workload.</abstract>"
1998,United States,"Head-up displays: Effects of clutter, display intensity, and display location on pilot performance","<title>Head-up displays: Effects of clutter, display intensity, and display location on pilot performance</title> <abstract>Two experiments examined the effects of display location (head-up and head-down), display clutter, and display intensity on pilot performance in a general aviation-cruise flight environment. In Experiment 1, a low-fidelity simulation revealed that the detection of commanded flight changes and flight-path tracking performance was better in the head-down condition as compared to the head-up condition. In contrast, midair traffic detection was superior with the head-up display (HUD), reflecting an attentional trade-off. Experiment 2 used the same paradigm in a high-fidelity visual simulation. Flight performance was equivalent between HUD and head-down locations. Detection of commanded changes and traffic was better in the HUD condition, revealing the HUD benefits of reduced scanning. The presence of clutter inhibited detection of command changes and traffic in both head-up and head-down conditions. Lowlighting the task-irrelevant clutter did not facilitate detection of commanded changes, however, the clutter cost for detecting traffic was diminished if the added information was lowlighted in the head-down location. The data suggested that attention was modulated between tasks (flight control and detection), and between display areas (head-up and head-down).</abstract>"

Selection is currently based on a standard battery of 20 different psychological tests as well as on medical tests and on an interview by a licensed psychologist. First, two-factor analyses were conducted to examine the relation between the tests in the battery. Then, a correlation study was conducted to evaluate the predictive validity of the tests against two criteria of pilot performance collected during the basic training period. Finally, a small-scale metaanalysis of previous validation studies in Norway was conducted. The best predictors of success in training, based on the meta-analysis, were Instrument Comprehension (r̄ = .29), Mechanical Principles (r̄ = .23), and Aviation Information (r̄ = .22).</abstract>"
1998,France,Cognitive evaluation of human-human and human-machine cooperation modes in air traffic control,"<title>Cognitive evaluation of human-human and human-machine cooperation modes in air traffic control</title> <abstract>An experiment is described that aimed at evaluating a principle of dynamic task allocation (DTA) of conflict resolution between aircraft in air-traffic control on a large scale simulator. It included three cognitive agents: the radar controller (RC), in charge of conflict detection and resolution; the planning controller (PC), in charge of entry-exit coordination and of workload regulation; and a conflict resolution computer system (SAINTEX), able to manage only simple conflicts. Within this three-agent paradigm, three conditions were compared: (a) a control condition (without computer assistance); (b) an explicit condition (PC and RC in charge of the allocation); and (c) an assisted explicit condition (SAINTEX proposed allocations which could be changed by PC). Comparisons were made on the basis of a detailed cognitive analysis of verbal protocols. The more the assistance, the more anticipative the mode of operation in controllers and the easier the human-human cooperation (HHC). These positive effects of the computer support are interpreted in terms of decreased workload and increased shared information space. In addition, the more the controllers felt responsible for task allocation, the more they criticized the machine operation.</abstract>"

1997,Australia,A computer-based analysis of expert and novice flight instructor preflight decision making,"<title>A computer-based analysis of expert and novice flight instructor preflight decision making</title> <abstract>The study was designed to examine aspects of flight instructor decision making involving the decision to authorize a student to conduct an initial, solo, cross-country flight. Experienced and inexperienced flight instructors were examined on a number of dimensions during a computer-based task presented in a Windows-based environment. Although differences were noted between experienced and inexperienced flight instructors in terms of the decision-outcome, no differences were evident relating to the process of information acquisition. Differences evident within the experienced group, however, suggested that the context of the scenario may have contributed to the outcome. These results are discussed in relation to flight instructor decision making training and standardization.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Transfer and quasi-transfer effects of scene detail and visual augmentation in landing training,"<title>Transfer and quasi-transfer effects of scene detail and visual augmentation in landing training</title> <abstract>Beginning flight students were taught landings in a flight simulator with a visual landing display to examine the effects of scene detail, visual augmented guidance, and number of landing training trials. Some students were trained in a control condition with no visual display. Transfer was assessed in the airplane in relation to the amount of landing training required prior to release for solo. Training with a low-detail scene was better for transfer than was training with a moderate-detail scene. An interaction between scene detail and augmented guidance showed that augmented guidance enhanced transfer when used in training with a low-detail scene but degraded transfer when used in training with a moderate-detail scene. The data also show that both visual and nonvisual training in the simulator build skills that enhance transfer.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Visual and auditory localization as a function of azimuth and elevation,"<title>Visual and auditory localization as a function of azimuth and elevation</title> <abstract>This study was performed to investigate the accuracy of performing a localization task as a function of the use of three display formats: auditory, perspective, and combined perspective-auditory. The experimental task for the perspective and perspective-auditory displays was to judge the relative azimuth and elevation that separated a computer-generated target object from a reference object. The experimental task for the auditory display was to determine the azimuth and elevation of a sound source with respect to the listener. For azimuth estimates, there was a significant effect for type of display, with worse performance resulting from the purely auditory format. Further, azimuth judgments were better for target objects that were aligned close to the major meridian orthogonal to the viewing vector. For elevation errors, there was a main effect for the type of display with worst performance for the purely auditory condition; elevation judgments were worse for larger elevation separations independent of display condition. Finally, elevation performance was superior when target images were aligned close to the major meridian orthogonal to the viewing vector. Implications of the results for the design of spatial instruments is discussed.</abstract>"

This study evaluated the efficacy of crew rest maintenance policies implemented by a school of aviation. After night flights, pilots living at home experienced daily reductions in sleep time, whereas pilots living under the school's regulations maintained equivalent sleep durations after day and night flights. In-house pilots maximized the use of rest opportunities when organizational support was both explicit and deliberate. Often overlooked, institutional support may be a critical element in the development and successful execution of crew rest plans.</abstract>"

Data was collected during a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Planned View Display Baseline Study conducted with Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center personnel. The correlation coefficient between the controllers' communication duration of the 4 min prior to a rating and the controllers' real-time subjective workload ratings was r = .88, p < .01, which validates communication duration as a workload measure. Automated monitoring of duration time would allow warning of controller stress on a real-time basis.</abstract>"
1997,Norfolk Island - United States,A human error approach to accident investigation: The taxonomy of unsafe operations,"<title>A human error approach to accident investigation: The taxonomy of unsafe operations</title> <abstract>Human error continues to be implicated in the vast majority of aviation accidents. Yet, most accident investigation and reporting systems are not currently designed around any theoretical framework of human error. One reason may be the discontinuity between classical theories of human error and the practical application of these theoretical approaches in accident investigation. The Taxonomy of Unsafe Operations presented here bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing field investigators with a user-friendly, common-sense framework from which accident investigations can be conducted and human causal factors classified. This taxonomy draws upon traditional models of human error to account for human accident causal factors, including the condition of operators and supervisory error. A detailed description of the taxonomy is provided, as well as a discussion of the benefits it provides the field of accident investigation and prevention.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Mental models and situation awareness in air traffic control,"<title>Mental models and situation awareness in air traffic control</title> <abstract>Air traffic controllers report that they form a mental picture of aircraft in airspace to assist in their work. In this study, the relationship of the picture to the concepts of mental models and situation awareness (SA) is discussed. A definition of SA is proposed that suggests it is the transient contents of awareness, as structured and supported by an underlying mental model. Research on SA in air traffic control is reviewed, and it appears that insufficient work has been done to demonstrate the importance of SA for successful task performance. An experiment with air traffic control trainees is described that relates their recall of basic aircraft data during a simulation to their scores in a final exam. The results showed that students prioritized aircraft information. Those who had accurate recall of aircraft altitude and heading had better outcomes. It is suggested that trainees, in retaining information about aircraft altitude and direction of flight, maintain a minimum but adequate set of data to help anticipate impending aircraft conflicts. It is recommended that further SA research be conducted to determine its salient components for a given task.</abstract>"
1997,New Zealand,Symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies in international pilots,"<title>Symptoms of fatigue and coping strategies in international pilots</title> <abstract>Fatigue is a major problem for international aircrew flying transmeridian routes. One hundred eighty-eight international pilots responded to a questionnaire that assessed overall fatigue and the symptoms pilots associated with fatigue on duty. The questionnaire also assessed the methods used by pilots to cope with fatigue before a duty as well as on the flight deck. Analysis showed that these symptoms could be grouped into five factors: sleepiness, cognitive dysfunction, emotional disturbance, boredom, and physical effects. Pilots reporting high levels of overall fatigue differed from other pilots in terms of noticing symptoms related to cognitive difficulties and emotional disturbance. The most common coping strategies used prior to a duty involved napping and conserving energy. Coping strategies used by pilots on the flight deck could be grouped into five factors: planning energy use, active coping, mental withdrawal, communicating with other crew, and coffee drinking. In their coping strategies during flights, high-fatigue pilots differed from other crew in their higher use of energy planning. The study suggests that pilots reporting high levels of fatigue may use different sensations to monitor when they are tired. Modifying some of the less functional coping strategies used by high-fatigue pilots may be a useful point of intervention to reduce fatigue.</abstract>"
1997,United States,The effects of the AH-64A pilot's night vision system on the performance of seven simulated maneuver tasks,"<title>The effects of the AH-64A pilot's night vision system on the performance of seven simulated maneuver tasks</title> <abstract>The Pilot's Night Vision System (PNVS) allows the pilot of the AH-64A Apache helicopter to fly and navigate effectively at night. The PNVS restricts field of view (FOV) and degrades visual acuity, two factors that should adversely affect pilot performance during night operations, especially for flight maneuvers that rely on peripheral cues. Participants, all AH-64A instructor pilots, flew a mission profile in a high-fidelity simulation of the AH-64A. The profile consisted of seven routine maneuvers that were flown first under daytime (baseline) conditions (using a rear projection display with a 174° FOV) then under night conditions (with a simulated PNVS display with a 40° FOV). Automated performance measures were the main dependent variables. It was expected that pilot performance degradation would be significant on hovering turns, takeoffs, and landings, and negligible on stationary hovering and hover taxiing. Significant performance degradations were found for all maneuver tasks. Applications of the findings to training and pilot workload standards are discussed.</abstract>"
1997,Norfolk Island - United States,Human factors analysis of postaccident data: Applying theoretical taxonomies of human error,"<title>Human factors analysis of postaccident data: Applying theoretical taxonomies of human error</title> <abstract>Human error is involved in nearly all aviation accidents, yet most accident reporting systems are not currently designed around any theoretical human-error framework. As a result, subsequent postaccident databases generally are not conducive to traditional human factors analysis, making the identification of interventions extremely difficult. To address this issue, this study utilized 3 conceptual models of information processing and human error to reorganize the human factors database associated with U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviation accidents between 1977-1992. All 3 taxonomies were able to accommodate well over three quarters of the pilot-causal factors contained in the database. Examinations of the recoded data revealed that procedural and response-execution errors were most common, followed by errors in judgment. However, judgment errors were more frequently associated with major than with minor accidents. Minor accidents, on the other hand, were associated more with procedural errors than were major accidents. This investigation demonstrates that existing postaccident databases can be reorganized using conceptual human-error frameworks, which may allow for previously unforeseen trends to be identified.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Optic flow and visual analysis of the base-to-final turn,"<title>Optic flow and visual analysis of the base-to-final turn</title> <abstract>In the spirit of other optic flow research, we address the problem of how a pilot turns an airplane into alignment with a runway, a maneuver that is one of the more challenging phases of visually controlled flight. In earlier work, Loomis and Beall (1992) proposed a rule for turning an aircraft into alignment: Turn the aircraft in such a way as to hold constant the rate of change of splay (the angle the projected runway makes with respect to the vertical). The experiment presented in this article was a psychophysical test of this rule. We compared day and night landing approaches as our experimental manipulation; we were interested in any role that ground texture might play in the spatial judgment involved in performing the landing approach. Three pilots varying in flight experience performed multiple approaches in a light aircraft for a total of 26 day and 25 night approaches. The three-dimensional trajectories of the aircraft were measured using differential global positioning system data. From these trajectories we computed a variety of motion variables (e.g., turn rate) and two optic flow variables (splay and splay rate). The similar performance of day and night approaches suggests that the pilots were using optic flow variables that were invariant with changes in the visibility of ground texture. A computer model was developed based on the optic flow rule and estimates of human visual processing thresholds. We conclude that the model gives a good description of pilot performance as tested in our experiment and may help to illuminate the cause of a class of airplane accidents during the common landing phase.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Sustaining female helicopter pilot performance with Dexedrine® during sleep deprivation,"<title>Sustaining female helicopter pilot performance with Dexedrine® during sleep deprivation</title> <abstract>To investigate the efficacy of Dexedrine® for maintaining the performance of sleep deprived female aviators, 6 female UH-60 pilots were exposed to 2 40-hr sleep deprivation periods during which they alternately received Dexedrine® (3 10-mg doses) or placebo. Dexedrine improved 6 of 9 flight simulator maneuvers and enhanced general levels of alertness as measured by EEG and Profile of Mood States assessments. The results from a cognitive test were negligible and inconsistent, probably because of the short test duration. Overall, it appeared that Dexedrine® effectively sustained the performance, alertness, and mood of female UH-60 pilots despite short-term sleep loss. There were no problematic side effects.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Alarm reaction patterns by pilots as a function of reaction modality,"<title>Alarm reaction patterns by pilots as a function of reaction modality</title> <abstract>Past research has demonstrated that operators may lose faith in an alarm system that they deem unreliable. This cry-wolf effect is manifested by slower and less frequent alarm responses. This research examined the effect of reaction modality (manual or vocal) on reactions to alarms of moderate reliability. Twenty-four pilots from the Madison County, Alabama, area performed tracking and monitoring tasks from the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (Parasuraman & Mouloua, 1987) while being presented with alarms, 75% of which were true. Pilots reacted to the alarms during one session using key presses and during another session using voice-activated responses. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to compare speed, accuracy, and frequency of primary and secondary task performances between vocal and manual alarm reactions. Results indicated that participants reacted to alarms more quickly in the manual mode than in the vocal mode; however, participants responded to a greater number of alarms vocally than manually. The results are discussed with regard to human performance theory and aviation applications.</abstract>"

Various programs have been developed to address the problem and are being applied, principally in ab initio pilot training. International airlines and military aviation authorities have developed their own programs. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention that exposes existing general aviation pilots to this training. The intervention was applied to a sample of 400 pilots. Analysis of the follow-up questionnaire responses shows an overwhelming acceptance and an indication that it has produced positive attitude changes in some individuals. The results indicate the validity of the intervention for broad scale application to all pilots.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Electronic map evaluation in simulated visual meteorological conditions,"<title>Electronic map evaluation in simulated visual meteorological conditions</title> <abstract>This study examined the effects of planar versus perspective electronic map displays during a simulated visual approach to landing. Thirty pilots were divided into 3 groups of 10 and assigned to 1 of 3 display conditions: 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, or a 2-dimensional condition augmented with a ""wedge"" to provide a visual momentum between the display view and that in the forward field of view. Each display condition was manipulated in terms of frame of reference, either rotating track-up or fixed north-up, and assessments were made of the pilots' ability to maintain the flight path and awareness of surrounding terrain. For all display conditions the track-up format supported the best tracking performance and also resulted in faster responses to some of the situation awareness tasks. The addition of a wedge onto the 2-dimensional display revealed a benefit in the form of improved lateral tracking with the north-up format. The results are discussed in terms of the costs and benefits associated with varying frame of reference and dimensionality on tasks of local guidance and global situation awareness.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Distributed representation as a principle for the analysis of cockpit information displays,"<title>Distributed representation as a principle for the analysis of cockpit information displays</title> <abstract>This article examines the representational properties of cockpit information displays from the perspective of distributed representations (Zhang & Norman, 1994). The basic idea is that the information needed for many tasks in a cockpit is distributed across the external information displays in the cockpit and the internal minds of the pilots. It is proposed that the relative distribution of internal and external information is the major factor of a display's representational efficiency. Several functionally equivalent but representationally different navigation displays are selected to illustrate how the principle of distributed representations is applied to the analysis of the representational efficiencies of cockpit information displays.</abstract>"

This work tested that proposition within an aviation team training setting. Results suggested that aviation team training improved the knowledge structures of those participants who received the training.

Finally, results obtained from the knowledge structure measures were consistent with performance results, suggesting that knowledge structure measures are a potentially valid predictor of performance.</abstract>"

Results from three studies involving the same computerized tests of instrument comprehension and psychomotor ability were combined in a meta-analysis to determine whether the validities of these tests generalized across three contexts. These were Royal Air Force and Turkish Air Force fixed-wing pilot training and British Army Air Corps rotary-wing pilot training. In this article, we discuss the adequacy of samples for estimating the validity of the tests, and the persistence of predictive validity to later stages of training as shown by British Army Air Corps data. Reference is also made to data from a fourth independent study of Qantas pilot training.</abstract>"

The average difference in endorsement levels across 11 items for pilots flying automated aircraft in 12 nations was 53%, reflecting significant national differences in attitudes on all items, with the largest differences observed for preference and enthusiasm for automation. The range of agreement across nations was on average four times larger than the range of agreement across different airlines within the same nation, and roughly six times larger than the range across pilots of standard and pilots of automated aircraft. Patterns of response are described in terms of dimensions of national culture. Implications of the results for development of safety cultures and culturally sensitive training are discussed.</abstract>"

Discussed in this article are a number of methodological issues that are relevant to research in this area, including task and subject characteristics, compensation for alcohol effects, and experimental design procedure considerations. Such factors may complicate attempts to determine the relationship between blood-alcohol levels and pilot performance and lead to an underestimation of alcohol effects.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Studies of cockpit task management errors,"<title>Studies of cockpit task management errors</title> <abstract>Cockpit task management (CTM) is the management level activity pilots perform as they initiate, monitor, prioritize, and terminate cockpit tasks. To better understand the nature and significance of this process, we conducted 3 empirical studies: a review of National Transportation Safety Board aircraft accident reports, a review of Aviation Safety Reporting System aircraft incident reports, and a simulator experiment. In the accident report study, we determined that CTM errors occurred in 76 (23%) of the 324 accidents we reviewed. We found CTM errors in 231 (49%) of the 470 incident reports we reviewed. In the simulator study, we found that CTM performance was inversely related to workload. We conclude that CTM is significant to flight safety and recommend that this realization be reflected in pilot training, in cockpit procedures, and in research to develop pilot aiding systems. Copyright © 1996, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Flight crews not only have to perform individual tasks to accomplish missions; they must manage tasks as well. They must make sure that tasks are started arid stopped at the right times and that undue attention to lower priority tasks does pot prevent the correct and timely completion of higher priority tasks. Just as failure to perform tasks correctly can lead to accidents, failure to manage tasks correctly can have catastrophic consequences as well. This article describes three related studies that have helped us to understand the nature and significance of task management in commercial flight operations: a study of aircraft accidents, a study of aircraft incidents, and a study of task management behavior in the laboratory.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Do individuals' visual recognition thresholds predict performance on concurrent attitude control flight tasks?,"<title>Do individuals' visual recognition thresholds predict performance on concurrent attitude control flight tasks?</title> <abstract>Two experiments tested near-threshold recognition performance throughout the visual field, examined the effect of the recognition task on a concurrent attitude tracking task, and tested whether individuals' near-threshold performance would predict their dual-task performance. In Experiment 1, an adaptive procedure measured the minimum viewing duration necessary for 75% performance in an aircraft classification task at various nonfoveal locations. Participants' critical tracking ability was also assessed using a central attitude display. Recognition deteriorated with eccentricity, and a wide distribution of recognition and tracking abilities was found. Experiment 2 combined the tasks; recognition was designated the primary task. Dual-task measures included the change in recognition accuracy and the increase in tracking error. Individuals' recognition thresholds (Experiment 1) failed to predict their dual-task tracking performance (Experiment 2). Notably, viewers' critical tracking ability predicted their success in preserving dual-task aircraft recognition. Recognition biases favoring the upper visual field were identified; this is consistent with a biased spatial attention system. Findings are potentially relevant to situation awareness assessment and to display design.</abstract>"

Frequently, however, the measure of success is passing or failing training. Some critics suggest that ordinary linear regression is inappropriate for such a dichotomous criterion and recommend using logistic regression. For the practitioner the question becomes: ""Will it make a difference in who is selected for pilot training?""

1996,United States,Electronic maps for terminal area navigation: Effects of frame of reference and dimensionality,"<title>Electronic maps for terminal area navigation: Effects of frame of reference and dimensionality</title> <abstract>Two experiments are reported that contrast rotating versus fixed electronic map displays, which pilots used for a simulated approach to a landing. In Experiment 1, a rotating versus fixed-map display was experimentally crossed with a two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) view (perspective map) as pilots' ability to maintain the flight path and demonstrate awareness of the location of surrounding terrain features were assessed. Rotating displays supported better flight path guidance and did not substantially harm performance on terrain awareness tasks. 3D displays led to a substantial cost for vertical control but did not differ from 2D displays in lateral control. In Experiment 2, pilots flew with the rotating 2D display and with an improved version of the rotating 3D display, designed to reduce the ambiguity of representing altitude information. Vertical control improved as a result of the 3D display design improvement, but lateral control did not. The results are discussed in terms of the costs and benefits of presenting information in 3D, ego-referenced format for both flight path control and terrain awareness.</abstract>"
1996,United States,Boundaries of cognitive performance as a function of age and flight experience,"<title>Boundaries of cognitive performance as a function of age and flight experience</title> <abstract>Age and expertise effects on time-sharing performance were examined. Pilots were considered to have an expertise in time-sharing because of their cockpit experience. Ninety pilots and nonpilots performed a battery of cognitive tasks that represented different aspects of piloting. The results revealed that time-sharing performance was age sensitive. However, expertise appeared to have some moderating influence on the age effects. Further, analysis of the overlap of the response distributions from different age groups suggested that age alone was not a definitive discriminator of an individual's time-sharing skill.

Measures of workload and mood were also obtained. Participants in both viewing conditions scanned an area 120° vertical by 240° horizontal while attempting to locate targets that appeared to be approaching them from one of a possible 18 locations. Results indicated significantly superior performance in the conventional dome display. Workload and mood measures also showed a significant advantage for the dome display.

At 0116 hours, participants were administered either a 5 mg/70 kg oral dose of d-methamphetamine (n = 10), 10 mg/70 kg d-methamphetamine (n = 10), or a placebo (n = 10) using standard double-blind procedures. Performance on all measures degraded markedly during the night in the placebo group. Both the 5- and 10-mg methamphetamines treatment reversed an initial decline in d′, and reversed increases in nonresponses (lapses) and tracking error within approximately 3 hr of administration. No evidence that amphetamine treatment increased impulsive responding (fast guesses) was observed. The magnitude of the performance effects of the methamphetamine treatments was similar at 3 hr postadministration. However, the effects of the 5-mg dose were shorter-lived, disappearing by the last testing session (6.5 hr postadministration), whereas effects of the 10-mg dose tended to remain throughout testing. Both amphetamine treatments decreased subjective sleepiness during the night and tended to increase subjective sleep latencies during a post-testing sleep period.

However, some evidence suggests that differences may exist for pilots of certain specific types of aircraft. The present experiment examined the influence of operational factors on the perceived structure of real-world scenes viewed during low-altitude flight. Multidimensional scaling analyses with stimuli consisting of videotape segments of low-altitude flight over a variety of real-world terrains revealed differences in perceived environmental structure for pilots assigned to different types of jet-fighter aircraft. These results provide evidence that perceptual learning evolves differently under different operational conditions and suggests that training programs should be designed to reflect those differences.

The pilots have been interviewed concerning the human machine interaction, the task allocation, and their reactions. The theoretical background relates to Reason's (1990) theory on human errors lis well as to Wicken's (1994) analysis of automation-induced problems.

However, selecting the simulator lo use during evaluation is driven more by simulator usage costs and availability than by an analysis of the simulator features needed for an effective crcwslation evaluation. This problem stems in part from a lack of well-documented lessons learned in identifying which simulator features are required to produce the same results as those obtained in flight.

Thirteen flight-naive suhjrcts each flew u simulated F-16 over a computer-generated flight environment lo lock onto and intercept a series or sequelitially appearing targets. The flight scene consisted of both an “out-the-window” view and a computer-generated heads-down spatial display showing an airplane symbol superimposed on a perspective view of the flight enivironment. During the interactive phase of the experiment, root mean square flight-path, target lock-on time, and target acquisition time were measured. After the interactive phase of the study was completed. subjects were required lo mark the location of the targets from memory on a computer-genernted top-down view of the flight scene in an attempt to reconstruct the spatial mental model which subjects formed of the flight environment. The results for the interactive phase of the study indicated that performance was superior using the pilot's-eye display. However, for the spatial reconstruction task, performance was better using the God's-eye display. It was also shown that the ability to maintain the optimal flight-path using the more top-down view of the sence (60° eyepoint) was superior to the 30 eyepoint elevation. Implications of the results for the design of spatial instruments are discussed. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1995,United States,Impact of Automation on Aircrew Communication and Decision-Making Performance,"<title>Impact of Automation on Aircrew Communication and Decision-Making Performance</title> <abstract>Increasing levels of automation are being introduced into the cockpit. Yet, it is difficult to predict the impact of these automatic systems on other elements of flight, such as crew communication and the ability to arrive at an effective decision. This study attempted to clarify the relation among these variables. Forty-eight pilots were assigned to two-person crews and asked to fly a simulated mission in either automated or manual conditions using a low-fidelity simulator. The scenario was designed to require crewmembers to arrive at a collective decision based on information obtained about an evolving simulated disaster. The results indicated that the introduction of automation was not associated with better performance. However, several significant differences were observed in the communications of crews flying in the automated versus manual conditions. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for communications training for advanced technology aircraft. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

The aviators appeared to be far less susceptible to the visual field narrowing found in nonaviators. The narrowing found in nonaviators suggested a tunnel-vision-like pattern. The rather small effect of load increases on aviator performance was likely due to specialized training and experience.

The overall task environment included tracking, resource management, and multiple monitoring subtasks. Slower, more accurate monitoring and better resource management were observed when the tracking subtask was automated. Although lower workload was reported when tracking was automated, fatigue increased equally during periods of manual and automatic tracking. When participants could control workload by shifting between manual and automatic tracking, participants with 7 hr of training switched between automatic and manual tracking. Their performance during optional automation periods was superior to their performance in conditions in which only manual control or only automated control was available. The findings argue for the utility of discretionary control of automated systems. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1995,United States,Role of Multiple Resources in Predicting Time-Sharing Efficiency: Evaluation of Three Workload Models in a Multiple-Task Setting,"<title>Role of Multiple Resources in Predicting Time-Sharing Efficiency: Evaluation of Three Workload Models in a Multiple-Task Setting</title> <abstract>The goal of our study was to assess the validity of the assumptions underlying three prominent workload models: the Time-Line Analysis and Prediction workload model (Parks & Boucek, 1989), the VACP workload model (Aldrich, Szabo, & Bierbaum, 1989), and the W/INDEX model (North & Riley, 1989). Sixteen subjects flew a low-fidelity flight simulation. Subjects were required to perform a two-axis tracking task, a concurrent visual-monitoring task, and a discrete decision task. The decision task had 16 variations defined by two levels on each of the following dimensions: input modality (visual vs. auditory), processing code (spatial vs. verbal), difficulty (easy vs. hard), and response modality (manual vs. voice). Dual-task costs were found only for the tracking task. The tracking data were then analyzed using two approaches: a traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a correlational analysis of tracking performance versus model predictions. The ANOVA revealed that performance on the tracking task was better when the concurrent decision task was responded to vocally and was easy. Input modality and processing code of the concurrent decision task had no significant effect on tracking performance. The correlational analysis was used to evaluate each of the three models, to determine what features were responsible for improving the models’ fit, and to compare their performance with a pure time-line model that makes no multiple-resource assumptions. All three models did a good job of predicting variance between experimental conditions, accounting for between 56% and 84% of the variance in our data and between 10% and 40% of an earlier data set. Different features of each model that affect the fit are then discussed. We conclude that it is important for models to retain a multiple-resource coding, although the best features of that coding remain to be determined. Coding tasks by their demand level appears to be less critical. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
1995,Japan - United States,Influence of Task Demand Characteristics on Workload and Performance,"<title>Influence of Task Demand Characteristics on Workload and Performance</title> <abstract>Two experiments are reported that examined the influence of variation in task demand on performance and workload. The first experiment considered how the manipulation of prior level of task demand affected subsequent workload and performance. The second experiment examined the effects on performance and workload of increments in the level of task demand. Results from the first study indicated that prior level of imposed task difficulty did affect response in a manner consistent with a scaling of workload in relation to previous task conditions. The second study demonstrated the primacy of absolute demand level over increments in that demand as influencing operator response. Overall, our results indicate that workload and performance are sensitive to multiple characteristics of the task and not instantaneous demand level alone. These findings are important in explaining why association and dissociation occur between task demand, operator efficiency, and perceived workload in differing performance contexts. The importance of these findings for the aviation psychologist in assessing pilot and operator workload is articulated. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
1995,United States,Effects of Workload Preview on Task Scheduling During Simulated Instrument Flight,"<title>Effects of Workload Preview on Task Scheduling During Simulated Instrument Flight</title> <abstract>Our study examined pilot scheduling behavior in the context of simulated instrument flight. Over the course of the flight, pilots flew along specified routes while scheduling and performing several flight-related secondary tasks. The first phase of flight was flown under low-workload conditions, whereas the second phase of flight was flown under high-workload conditions in the form of increased turbulence and a disorganized instrument layout. Six pilots were randomly assigned to each of three workload preview groups. Subjects in the no-preview group were not given preview of the increased-workload conditions. Subjects in the declarative preview group were verbally informed of the nature of the flight workload manipulation but did not receive any practice under the high-workload conditions. Subjects in the procedural preview group received the same instructions as the declarative preview group but also flew half of the practice flight under the high-workload conditions. The results show that workload preview fostered efficient scheduling strategies. Specifically, those pilots with either declarative or procedural preview of future workload demands adopted an efficient strategy of scheduling more of the difficult secondary tasks during the low-workload phase of flight. However, those pilots given a procedural preview showed the greatest benefits in overall flight performance. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
1995,United States,Flight Instruction: The Challenge From Situated Cognition,"<title>Flight Instruction: The Challenge From Situated Cognition</title> <abstract>A primary claim from the field of situated cognition is that learning is ineffective if removed from the context in which the target skills must be deployed. This claim is inconsistent with many of the mainstream approaches to education and cognition. I describe what it means to be situated, and I outline the central issues raised in the literature on situated cognition and situated learning. The ideas outlined here have several implications for the conduct of flight instruction. The most pervasive implications are that current and potential training practices in aviation can create a breach between instruction and practice and can lead to the development of inert skills. A recurrent theme for situated cognition is that there is a self-organizing character to learning. If adequately supported by the design of the workspace and the structure of the training program, this self-organizing character of learning will limit the possibility of a breach between instruction and practice and will ensure development of robust skills. A further implication of the research reviewed here is that the role of aviation specialists in the design of systems and training programs has been too limited for it to be fully effective. I introduce the procedure of participatory design as an alternative approach that may ensure the effectiveness of flight training. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

For these systems to be utilized effectively, a means of providing the recommendations of the system and information for assessing the quality of those recommendations must be provided in a manner that meets the stringent workload and time requirements of the cockpit. A research study was undertaken to determine interface guidelines for presenting information on expert-system recommendations in this context. Four methods of presenting expert-system confidence associated with recommendations were compared to each other and to a control condition in which no confidence information was presented. Significant differences between display conditions and between experts and novices were found in their use of system-confidence information. Recommendations are presented for conveying real-time information on the reasoning processes of expert systems in future cockpits. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Four of the pilots flew with a low blood alcohol level (BAL; mean BAL = 20.63 mg%). Pilots’ performance was compared in terms of flying performance, navigation, and radio communication. We hypothesized that the tasks most likely to be shed as a result of alcohol impairment would be those lower down in the task prioritization hierarchy of “aviate, navigate and communicate”. This hypothesis was supported; alcohol was found to impair significantly pilots’ radio communication. Results are discussed with reference to the piloting task and the implications for alcohol regulation in aviation. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

A decluttering system that allowed the pilots to selectively suppress various information groups in some of the prototype formats was also investigated. Results of the experimental study indicated that there was no degradation, and possibly a limited gain in information-retrieval performance when IAP information was presented in electronic format and compared to traditional paper IAPs. Each pilot preferred the selectable decluttering feature. The preferred chart was a color, north-up (nonmoving map) format with the decluttering capability.

Workload conditions were created by varying time pressure and external communications requirements. Our interest was in how the pilots strategically managed or adapted to the increasing workload. We independently assessed the pilot's ranking of the priority of different discrete tasks during the approach and landing. Pilots were found to sacrifice some aspects of primary flight control as workload increased. For discrete tasks, increasing workload increased the amount of time in performing the high priority tasks, decreased the time in performing those of lowest priority, and did not affect duration of performance episodes or optimality of scheduling of tasks of any priority level. Individual differences analysis revealed that high-performing subjects scheduled discrete tasks earlier in the flight and shifted more often between different activities. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, one concern in workload assessment has been the identification of how much workload is too much. This study established and used workload redlines in determining the feasibility of a two-person (no navigator) KC-135 conceptual cockpit design. Ten KC-135 crews and 2 KC-10 crews were required to fly several simulator missions over a period of 1 week.

The various performance measures and the subjective-workload measures provided convergent results supporting the feasibility of the conceptual design.

1994,United States,Pilot Interaction With Cockpit Automation II: An Experimental Study of Pilots’ Model and Awareness of the Flight Management System,"<title>Pilot Interaction With Cockpit Automation II: An Experimental Study of Pilots’ Model and Awareness of the Flight Management System</title> <abstract>Technological developments have made it possible to automate more and more functions on the commercial aviation flight deck and in other dynamic high-consequence domains. This increase in the degrees of freedom in design has shifted questions away from narrow technological feasibility. Many concerned groups, from designers and operators to regulators and researchers, have begun to ask questions about how we should use the possibilities afforded by technology skillfully to support and expand human performance. In this article, we report on an experimental study that addressed these questions by examining pilot interaction with the current generation of flight deck automation. Previous results on pilot-automation interaction derived from pilot surveys, incident reports, and training observations have produced a corpus of features and contexts in which human-machine coordination is likely to break down (e.g., automation surprises). We used these data to design a simulated flight scenario that contained a variety of probes designed to reveal pilots’ mental model of one major component of flight deck automation: the Flight Management System (FMS). The events within the scenario were also designed to probe pilots’ ability to apply their knowledge and understanding in specific flight contexts and to examine their ability to track the status and behavior of the automated system (mode awareness). Although pilots were able to “make the system work” in standard situations, the results reveal a variety of latent problems in pilot-FMS interaction that can affect pilot performance in nonnormal time critical situations. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1994,United States,Using Knowledge Exploration Tools to Study Airspace Complexity in Air Traffic Control,"<title>Using Knowledge Exploration Tools to Study Airspace Complexity in Air Traffic Control</title> <abstract>A study was conducted at the Federal Aviation Administration's Jacksonville en route air traffic control center to identify factors that contribute to airspace complexity. Direct (verbal reports) and indirect (multidimensional scaling) procedures were used to identify potential factors. A list of candidate factors was created by combining the data from the direct and indirect knowledge exploration methods. Important complexity factors were identified by determining their simple and multiple correlations with overall sector complexity as judged by a group of Traffic Management Unit personnel (flow controllers). A final list of 16 complexity factors was developed and is suggested as a reference for future research in the area. An evaluation of the knowledge extraction techniques indicated that, although little unique information was generated by the indirect procedure, it was useful for the identification of complexity factors when combined with data from direct sources. Further research to validate the identified sector complexity factors is recommended. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
1993,United States,En Route Air Traffic Controllers' Use of Flight Progress Strips: A Graph-Theoretic Analysis,"<title>En Route Air Traffic Controllers' Use of Flight Progress Strips: A Graph-Theoretic Analysis</title> <abstract>In the United States, flight data are represented on a paper flight progress strip (FPS). The role of the FPS has recently attracted attention because of plans to automate this aspect of air traffic control (ATC). The communication and FPS activities of controllers were classified as they controlled air traffic of varying complexity. Transition networks were derived from the empirical transitions. These networks indicated that several aspects of ATC generalize across complexity including the centrality of writing on the FPSs and the control of traffic. Complexity affected when FPSs were used with high-complexity traffic situations that required the controller to devote uninterrupted periods of time to the management of the FPSs rather than integrate these board management responsibilities with the responsibilities of separating aircraft. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1993,United States,Aviation Computer Games for Crew Resource Management Training,"<title>Aviation Computer Games for Crew Resource Management Training</title> <abstract>Crew resource management (CRM) training programs have existed for more than a decade, yet methods for providing aircrews with opportunities to practice CRM skills have been limited to role plays in class and scenarios in operational flight trainers. There are drawbacks to both training methods; role plays have few, if any, realistic environmental cues to help crews behave as they do in the cockpit, and simulator scenarios are limited by the cost and availability of the simulators. Research using inexpensive, tabletop computer-based simulations as CRM training media was conducted with military aircrews. Reactions of the crewmembers taking part in the research were very positive both in their acceptance of the system in general and as a trainer for CRM skills. This article presents this research and reports the reactions of aircrews to the tabletop simulation. In addition, a series of recommendations are provided regarding the implementation and use of this low-fidelity simulation. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

A 20-item scale was developed for measuring attitudes toward commonly encountered automated devices that reflect a potential for complacency. Factor analysis of responses (N = 139) to scale items revealed four factors: Confidence-Related, Reliance-Related, Trust-Related, and Safety-Related Complacency. It is proposed that these form components of automation-induced complacency rather than general attitudes toward automation. The internal consistency (r =. 87) and test reliability (r =. 90) of the factors and the scale as a whole were high. Complacency potential is discussed with respect to interrelations between automation and operator trust in and reliance on automation. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1993,United States,Performance Consequences of Automation-Induced “Complacency”,"<title>Performance Consequences of Automation-Induced “Complacency”</title> <abstract>The effect of variations in the reliability of an automated monitoring system on human operator detection of automation failures was examined in two experiments. For four 30-min sessions, 40 subjects performed an IBM PC-based flight simulation that included manual tracking and fuel-management tasks, as well as a system-monitoring task that was under automation control. Automation reliability'the percentage of system malfunctions detected by the automation routine'either remained constant at a low or high level over time or alternated every 10 min from low to high. Operator detection of automation failures was substantially worse for constant-reliability than for variable-reliability automation after about 20 min under automation control, indicating that the former condition induced “complacency”. When system monitoring was the only task, detection was very efficient and was unaffected by variations in automation reliability. The results provide the first empirical evidence of the performance consequences of automation-induced “complacency”. We relate findings to operator attitudes toward automation and discuss implications for cockpit automation design. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1993,United States,Time Required for Transmission of Time-Critical Air Traffic Control Messages in an En Route Environment,"<title>Time Required for Transmission of Time-Critical Air Traffic Control Messages in an En Route Environment</title> <abstract>This article examines the time required for an air traffic control specialist to successfully transmit a message containing a maneuver required for traffic avoidance to a pilot in the en route environment. Time required was measured from the beginning of the controller's message to the end of the pilot's correct acknowledgement. Forty-six hours of voice tapes from three Air Route Traffic Control Centers were analyzed, yielding 80 maneuvers issued for traffic avoidance. The mean total time required for message transmission was found to be 11 sec. In the analysis, this total was broken down into its component parts: (a) duration of the controller's message, (b) time between the end of the controller's message and the beginning of the pilot's response, and (c) duration of the pilot's acknowledgment. Transmissions that relayed turn clearances for reasons other than traffic avoidance and relayed traffic advisories were also examined. Transmissions that were successfully completed with a single controller transmission were compared to those that required more than one controller call. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1993,United States,Analysis of Problems in Routine Controller-Pilot Communication,"<title>Analysis of Problems in Routine Controller-Pilot Communication</title> <abstract>Previous studies of controller-pilot communication have identified communication problems but not how often or why they occur. A more complete picture of these problems requires an understanding of how controllers and pilots successfully communicate during routine operations. We describe a field study of routine controllerpilot communication and the problems that disrupt this communication. Guided by a model of collaboration during communication, voice tapes of communication during terminal operations were coded d analyzed. Two kinds of communication problems were examined: (a) procedural deviations (e.g., partial readbacks) and (b) inaccuracies (e.g., incorrect readbacks). The results suggest that these problems are infrequent events in routine communication. However, they are associated with communication factors such as air traffic control message length and composition and traffic level. These relations suggest potential causes of problems that disrupt routine controllerpilot communication. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

For 4 consecutive weeks during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 18 A-6 (9 pilots, 9 bombardier/navigators) and 18 F-14 (10 pilots, 8 radar intercept officers) aircrew on board the USS America provided detailed daily activity data. Additional operational data and subjective reports of aircrew readiness (the amount of crew rest required before a combat mission could be flown) were obtained following each mission. Multiple-regression analysis indicated that flight duration, time of day that a flight occurred, number and order of flights in a day, and amount of sleep obtained 12 hr before flying aided in the prediction of aircrew combat readiness. These data provide valuable information for air wing commanders, senior mission planners, and air wing flight surgeons to consider when assessing aircrew readiness. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Pilots, qualified on auto flight aircraft, flew simulated approaches while using a moving-map terrain display in addition to typical glass-cockpit navigation displays. During the simulation, TSA was evaluated by issuing erroneous air traffic control (ATC) vectors toward hazardous terrain. When given vectors toward such terrain, there was a 50% overall hazard-recognition rate when pilots used a terrain display based on current terrain-depiction methods and a 78% recognition rate when using a terrain display based on smoothed-contour terrain depiction. After the subject-pilots realized they could not rely on ATC for terrain separation, hazard-recognition rates increased from 20% to 62% for the display based on current depiction methods and from 25% to 93% for the smoothed-contour display. Advanced terrain displays appear to be an effective means by which flight crews can ensure terrain separation without reliance on ATC. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Transfer was from moderate-detail and low-detail scenes; from constant, adaptive, and no visual augmentation; and from fast, normal, and slow roll response. Transfer was assessed in the simulator with a moderate-detail pictorial scene, no visual augmentation, and a normal roll response. Training with visual augmentation was superior to training without it, although a Scene Detail x Visual Augmentation interaction revealed that the nonpredictive guidance augmentation enhanced transfer only when it was combined in training with the low-detail scene. Transfer from a low-detail, unaugmented display was poor, and there was some evidence of poor transfer from a fast roll response. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
1992,United States,Pilot Interaction With Cockpit Automation: Operational Experiences With the Flight Management System,"<title>Pilot Interaction With Cockpit Automation: Operational Experiences With the Flight Management System</title> <abstract>Due to recent incidents involving glass cockpit aircraft, there is growing concern about cockpit automation and its potential effects on pilot performance. However, little is known about the nature and causes of problems that arise in pilot-automation interaction. In this article, we report the results of two studies that provide converging, complementary data on pilots’ difficulties with understanding and operating one of the core systems of cockpit automation, the Flight Management System (FMS). As vehicles to gather a corpus on the nature and variety of FMS-related problems, we used a survey asking pilots to describe specific incidents with the FMS, and we used the observations of pilots undergoing transition training to a glass cockpit aircraft. The results of both studies indicate that pilots become proficient in standard FMS operations through ground training and subsequent line experience. But even with considerable line experience, they still have difficulties tracking FMS status and behavior in certain flight contexts, and they show gaps in their understanding of the functional structure of the system. The results suggest that design-related factors such as opaque interfaces contribute to these difficulties, which can affect pilots’ situation awareness. The results of this research are relevant for both the design of cockpit automation and the development of training curricula specifically tailored to the needs of glass cockpits. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Before the main analyses, the extreme skewness of the DLT and PMT error measures was corrected by log transformations, and between-squadrons differences in flight grades were removed by transformations based on z scores. Primary flight grades were highly correlated with the psychomotor scores (rs = -.26 to -.41) and moderately correlated with the dichotic listening scores (rs = -.22 to -.28). These rs were significant at an experiment-wise alpha of. 05. Multiple regression analysis indicated an even stronger validity coefficient when a combination of the performance measures was used (R =. 442). Furthermore, the 19.5% of flight grade variance accounted for by the performance-based tests was largely independent of the 16.6% variance accounted for by a combination of current selection tests and demographic variables. The results suggest that assessing concurrent psychomotor tracking and DLT performance may be a particularly appropriate way of predicting performance in naval flight training. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A weighted composite of Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) flying performance data (i.e., daily flying grades, check flight grades, and academic grades) was shown to be related closely to advanced training recommendations (fighter vs. nonfighter aircraft). This suggested that this composite score was a reasonable measure of pilot candidate quality because fighter aircraft assignments are considered more prestigious and demanding than nonfighter assignments. When the weighted composite algorithm was modified to include UPT eliminees, however, it demonstrated little utility in adding to our understanding of the relation between performance on selection instruments (i.e., test scores) and training performance (i.e., had little impact on the rankings of the applicants). These results were not surprising, however, as the dichotomous UPT final outcome indicator was strongly correlated with UPT performance as measured by the weighted composite scores. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Three flight displays (central, peripheral, and ecological) were employed between subjects for the primary task, and the type of secondary task (object identification or motion judgment) and the presentation location of the task in the visual field (central or peripheral) were manipulated within groups. The two visual-spatial tasks were time-shared to investigate the possibility of a compatibility mapping between the task type and task location. The attentional costs associated with time-sharing visual-spatial tasks were also addressed. The results show that (a) the ecological display allowed for the most efficient time-sharing, suggesting further investigation into the use of nontraditional flight displays for the reduction of central visual overload in the cockpit; (b) the type of task determined how quickly it was performed while the location determined how accurately it was performed; and (c) two peripheral tasks were found to interfere more than one central and one peripheral task, or two central tasks. Regardless of the task type, peripheral tasks are more demanding than central tasks. Although limited evidence was found to support the compatibility hypothesis, no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that central and peripheral vision constitute separate resources. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

More direct research with the pilot population will be necessary to better understand aging and pilot performance.

Although much effort has been devoted to the development of prescriptive models of aeronautical decision making (ADM) and the preparation of training materials, very few attempts have been made to study the actual decision-making processes of pilots. This article reviews the available literature of descriptive studies of ADM, as well as other examples of naturalistic decision making in complex, dynamic environments. The process of ADM appears to differ in significant ways from the normative approach of decision analysis. A framework model of ADM is proposed and its compatibility with current artificial intelligence models of decision making is discussed. The role of this descriptive model in directing future research into ADM and as a basis for further prescriptive efforts are highlighted. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1992,Colombia,Administrative Risk Management for Helicopter Operators,"<title>Administrative Risk Management for Helicopter Operators</title> <abstract>Everyone who saw the fireball of high technology and humanity mushroom over Florida January 28, 1986, carries its memory. But one person, the NASA manager who gave final approval for the Challenger launch, especially has to feel a sense of grief and responsibility. Caught between the pressure to satisfy politicians, the American people, NASA's launch schedule, and a complicated array of possible system failures, he made a decision that proved fatal. On a much more routine but no less lethal scale, most aviation operations managers are caught between the pressure to run an efficient, lean, and responsive operation and the ever-present possibility that an overlooked or underestimated “O-ring” will fail. In the aviation business, the human element is the weak link or “O-ring” more often than not. As the NASA manager knows only too well, no matter who is the pilot-incommand, the manager who selects the pilot; sets crew standards and duty cycles; and establishes company weather minimums and other operating standards is ultimately responsible for operational safety. This article is intended to provide an easy reference to the operating pitfalls, the human frailties, and the risks associated with managing flight operations. Helicopter air-ambulance operators are used to illustrate specific problems and provide extreme examples. The analysis identifies the inherent risks based on the latest National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident data (NTSB, 1988) and describes techniques that can be used to balance the demands of running a business with the need for maintaining safety. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting the key concerns that should be carefully considered from a risk-management viewpoint. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The demographic characteristics of these more recent academy trainees (from a more stabilized poststrike selection process) were compared with two previous groups of academy entrants (one prestrike, one poststrike). The impact of biodemographic characteristics on success in ATC specialist (ATCS) training was evaluated. Also, results were obtained from the aptitude tests that were used to select the academy entrants. Pooled within-group correlations between the discriminating variables and the canonical discriminant function were calculated to determine the characteristics related to academy pass-fail status. Variables that were significantly related to academy performance included high school math grades, personal performance expectations, age, and the number of times an ATCS applicant had taken the qualifying aptitude tests.

There were significant differential transfer effects as assessed by measures of accuracy and stability in lateral control. Training with pictorial scenes (whether of high or low detail) was superior to training with a symbolic scene, but there was no general transfer advantage from training with high versus low scene detail. Nor was there any general advantage of training with the transfer level of crosswind. In contrast to the prediction of a high-fidelity theory of transfer, the data show that values of crosswind higher or lower than the transfer value can be advantageous in certain circumstances. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Although a significant problem, design specifications for alleviation of simulator sickness have not yet been produced. The problems researchers face in this area are multiple: (a) Simulator sickness is polygenic, rendering experimental isolation of variables ineffective; (b) simulator sickness is polysymptomatic, which must be reflected in measurements of the human response; and (c) there are statistical limitations including limited sample sizes, adaptation over flights, small effect sizes, and large individual differences. These problems render certain research and engineering strategies more effective than others. Our conclusions, based on analysis of a large data base (more than 2,000 exposures in military simulators) and statistical power calculations, suggest that improved simulator-design criteria can best be studied in “field experiments” in which large sample sizes permit the relatively small effects of several different simulator-equipment features to be isolated, contrasted, and revealed. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1991,United States,Situation Awareness: A Critical But Ill-Defined Phenomenon,"<title>Situation Awareness: A Critical But Ill-Defined Phenomenon</title> <abstract>Situation awareness has recently gained considerable attention as a performance-related psychological concept This is especially true in the aviation domain where it is considered an essential prerequisite for the safe operation of the complex dynamic system “aircraft”. There are concerns, however, that inappropriately designed automatic systems introduced to advanced flight decks may reduce situation awareness and thereby put aviation safety at risk. Situation awareness has thus become a ubiquitous phrase. It's use is most often based on an intuitive understanding; a commonly accepted definition is still missing. To fill this gap, we analyze the cognitive basis of the concept, embedding it in the context of related psychological concepts. On this basis, methodological approaches to the investigation of situation awareness are discussed. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

1991,United States,Formal Papers: Frames of Reference for Helicopter Electronic Maps: The Relevance of Spatial Cognition and Componential Analysis,"<title>Formal Papers: Frames of Reference for Helicopter Electronic Maps: The Relevance of Spatial Cognition and Componential Analysis</title> <abstract>Maps are important for most forms of navigational flight, yet for helicopter flight they are critical. Computer-generated map displays for Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE) and low-level helicopter flight were configured according to previous research on maps, navigational problem solving and spatial cognition in large-scale environments. Interest centered on different frame-of-reference representations. The north-up map emphasized consistency of object location, characteristic of an earth-centered frame of reference. The track-up map emphasized map-terrain congruency, characteristic of an ego-centered frame of reference. Twenty skilled pilots used the maps to complete several navigational tasks that occurred within a realistic simulation program tailored for helicopter navigation. Findings revealed an interesting pattern of map-task dependencies. A componential analysis suggests that different cognitive components such as orienting and absolute object location are supported to varying degrees by properties of different frames of reference. These findings are important for designers of helicopter map displays. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

A Discussion of a Major Air Carrier's Approach to Total Crew Training</title> <abstract>Cockpit resource management (CRM) training has made significant progress throughout the past 10 years. Nearly all domestic and foreign carriers, however, limit CRM training to flight-deck crews. This article presents a description of the America West Airlines approach to total crew training, namely, inclusion of flight attendants in the Aircrew Team Dynamics (ATD) seminar. Program design and implementation are discussed along with course objectives for the 2-day event. Reflections on training pilots and flight attendants together are presented as well as a discussion of what was learned training the trainers.

1991,United States,Display Magnification for Simulated Landing Approaches,"<title>Display Magnification for Simulated Landing Approaches</title> <abstract>Previous discussions of simulated landings suggest that biases not found during aircraft flight are induced by one or more features of a simulator. Inadequate representation of texture or of ground detail and distortions in judgments of size from near accommodation to a display are two of the factors that have been thought to contribute to these biases. Addition of surface detail and magnification of the display have been suggested as corrective solutions. The research reported here was a preliminary investigation of the effects of factors that might induce biased landing approaches in a simulator and of a procedure for calibrating a simulator to eliminate biases. Scene content, display magnification, runway size, and start point all influenced glideslope control. With an appropriate start point and appropriate runway dimensions, there was a close correspondence between performance in an aircraft and performance in a simulator in which the display magnification had been set at unity and in which a moderate level of scene detail was presented. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1991,United States,Practitioner Paper: Simulator Qualification: Just as Phony as It Can Be,"<title>Practitioner Paper: Simulator Qualification: Just as Phony as It Can Be</title> <abstract>The qualification of airplane simulators for pilot training is based on the assumption that transfer of such training is directly related to the similarity of the device to an actual airplane. The consequence of this widely held position has been the specification of training device requirements solely on the basis of engineering criteria. However, the proper criterion is the flight hours saved in airborne training for each incremental investment in ground training. Furthermore, research has shown that innovations in training strategies, in some cases involving intentional departures from reality, can have stronger effects than high simulator fidelity on the resulting quality of pilot performance. Ideally, each aspect of the training curriculum could be taught to some criterion performance level on the ground. Competence in each block of training would be demonstrated after a brief transition in the airplane. Certification for each license and rating would be based on demonstrated competence, thereby making possible large reductions in the minimum required flying hours. Credit for ground-based training would no longer be a formal issue. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. All right reserved.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Examining Transfer of Training Using Curve Fitting: A Second Look,"<title>Examining Transfer of Training Using Curve Fitting: A Second Look</title> <abstract>Curve fitting is a powerful method for examining transfer of training that has been essentially ignored by the aviation community. This article first describes some of the advantages of curve fitting compared to traditional transfer-of-training formulas. Some of the practical problems associated with curve fitting and methods for circumventing them are discussed. Finally, data from a mental rotation experiment are analyzed using both curve fitting and a common transfer-of-training formula. The results from curve fitting clearly provide more detailed information about the skills that transferred and the magnitude of the effects. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1991,United States,Communication Variations and Aircrew Performance,"<title>Communication Variations and Aircrew Performance</title> <abstract>The relationship between communication variations and aircrew performance (high-error vs. low-error performances) was investigated by analyzing the coded verbal transcripts derived from the videotape records of 18 two-person air transport crews who participated in a high-fidelity, full-mission flight simulation. The flight scenario was designed to be as realistic as possible but consisted of a task which included abnormal operations and required the coordinated efforts of all crew members. It was found that the best performing crews were characterized by nearly identical patterns of communication, whereas the midrange and poorer performing crews showed a great deal of heterogeneity in their speech patterns. Although some specific speech sequences can be interpreted as being more or less facilitative to the crew coordination process, predictability appears to be the key ingredient for enhancing crew performance. Crews communicating in highly standard, hence predictable, ways were better able to coordinate their task, whereas crews characterized by multiple, nonstandard communication profiles were less effective in their performance. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

1991,United States,Heart Period as a Useful Index of Pilot Workload in Commercial Transport Aircraft,"<title>Heart Period as a Useful Index of Pilot Workload in Commercial Transport Aircraft</title> <abstract>As part of a larger study of the validity and reliability of various workload measures for use in aircraft certification, heart period (a function of heart rate) was investigated. In two separate experiments, pilots flew either normal-workload or high-workload missions in a B-727 simulator to determine whether the measures could serve to discriminate between the two workload levels. To test reliability of the measures, the pilots flew the missions again on another day. The results indicate that heart period can serves as an effective supplemental index of aircrew workload in the case of transport aircraft flight deck certification. Furthermore, although sampling artifacts make a strong interpretation tenuous, samples of 30 heartbeats proved sensitive to our workload manipulations and appeared to capture the phasic changes in workload better than did the heart data collected from the entire phase of flight duration. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

1991,United States,Peripheral Polar-Graphic Displays for Signal/Failure Detection,"<title>Peripheral Polar-Graphic Displays for Signal/Failure Detection</title> <abstract>The object of this series of studies was to examine the utility of multivariate polar-graphic iconic displays, placed in the parafoveal or near-peripheral regions of the visual field, for the presentation of multiple indices of subsystem performance in an aircraft system context. Results of the first study suggest that (a) such a display, circumscribed about a primary flight instrument, could be used readily to detect performance deviations that exceeded defined “normal” bounds; and (b) polygons are more effective than polar histograms. The second study was used to examine the hypothesis that the superior performance obtained with polar formats was not merely a function of reductions in visual scanning requirements but stemmed from the organization and symmetry found in the iconic display. In addition, index markings lacking in the first study were added to the polar histogram to determine if these would materially affect speed and accuracy of judgments. Performance using polar histograms in the second study was found superior to that obtained using needle indicators of similar spatial distribution, polar-graphic iconic displays ranking between the other two display types. The results suggest that order of merit of displays may be altered by small format changes and that the performance benefits of polar-graphic iconic displays stem from factors beyond the simple physical proximity of the component indicators. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

For the derivation study, 225 pilot candidates operated CAPSS before entering PFS. A pool of 20,700 summary measures (SMs) from 880 data sets was generated from the raw data. Through several cycles of analyses these measures were reduced to a single prediction equation. The equation was cross-validated on a new sample of 172 pilot candidates. The CAPSS equation significantly predicted PFS outcome for the cross-validation sample, r =. 47, p <. 00005. Classification analysis indicated that 79.4% of the candidates selected by CAPSS actually passed PFS, compared to 69.8% for the current selection system. Only 13.3% of those who could have passed were rejected, whereas the current system is estimated to reject 57.0% of qualified applicants. It is estimated that using CAPSS instead of the current selection system will double the number of PFS graduates from a group of applicants. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

1991,Australia,The Development and Evaluation of Right Instructors: A Descriptive Survey,"<title>The Development and Evaluation of Right Instructors: A Descriptive Survey</title> <abstract>Results from a survey of flight instructors and flight training standards inspectors in Canada indicate that flight instructor training is still highly influenced by traditional methods of instruction, such as rote learning and the mimicking of another instructors patter. The quality of flight instructor training also varies greatly because there is no standardized syllabus for the instructor course. Both flight instructors and inspectors felt that flight instructor training should provide competency in teaching methods and a more thorough understanding of learning and evaluation theories. They also stressed the need for senior instructors who teach the flight instructor course to receive additional training before they are authorized to teach others how to teach because the quality of flight training rests with them. Flight instructors conveyed strong feelings about the methods used by Transport Canada to evaluate their teaching effectiveness. The main objections concerned the use of role playing as a means of assessing the teaching ability of flight instructors and the use of a flight test record to hold flight instructors accountable for the success or failure of their students. By far, the most contentious issue was the flight test record. Because flight instructors are not protected by tenure or a permanent teaching qualification, they saw the evaluation process, based on accountability, not so much as a useful tool for personal improvement, but as an interference or a threat to their livelihood. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Considerable resistance to change was encountered at the outset. The attitudes of flight instructors who were trained to teach the course were surveyed before and after the instructor training using Helmreich s (1984) Cockpit Management Attitudes Questionnaire modified for use by naval aviators. Shifts in attitudes following training were measured using a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. Significant shifts in the expected direction were detected. The implications of these attitudinal shifts are discussed. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. All right reserved.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Transfer of Simulated Instrument Training to Instrument and Contact Flight,"<title>Transfer of Simulated Instrument Training to Instrument and Contact Flight</title> <abstract>Identification of the specific contribution of training system variables (e.g., simulator system components, training mixes, curriculum utilization strategies) will ultimately lead to more efficient training for all tasks. An interest in the acquisition of piloting skills has led a number of researchers to question the relative transfer of simulated instrument training to instrument and contact flight. In this study, we examined the transfer of simulated instrument training from Device 2F101, the operational flight trainer for the T-2C aircraft, to actual instrument and contact flight for level speed change and standard-rate turn maneuvers. Trainees were randomly assigned to one of three training levels (two, four, or eight simulator flights) and to one of two aircraft flight conditions following training (contact or basic instruments) in a counterbalanced sequence. Altitude, air speed, and heading errors in deviations from controlled flight were recorded as measures of training effectiveness. The most notable finding indicates significant and equal transfer of instrument training to contact and instrument flight for the maneuvers selected. Other findings indicate differential learning rates for the two maneuvers but also indicate equal final performance on each maneuver for both types of flight. Finally, training mix (for aircraft or simulator training trial) was found to have no effect on student performance after eight trials. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

The stages of the accident-generation process include ubiquitous hazards which lead to occasional incidents that in turn result in less frequent accidents. Steps in the investigation process included fact finding, information analysis, and authority review. The use of comparison data sources and mishap data bases are important collateral-investigation activities. The basic classes of accident-prevention measures included environmental-hazard exposure limitations, equipment safety features and/or warning devices, and establishing procedural safeguards. Human factors problems are associated with 50% to 90% of all accidents, whereas system safety principles provide the logical framework for deciding which type of countermeasures to apply in ameliorating such problems. This article describes the interface between human factors and system-safety concepts and provides examples of successful accident-prevention programs. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

1991,United States,Scene Content and Runway Breadth Effects on Simulated Landing Approaches,"<title>Scene Content and Runway Breadth Effects on Simulated Landing Approaches</title> <abstract>Eight experienced pilots flew landing approaches in a light-aircraft simulator with a computer-generated landing display. Scene content and runway breadth were manipulated. Approaches were lower with reduced scene content and to the narrow runways, and trial-to-trial variability was higher with reduced scene content. There was no significant interaction between scene content and runway breadth. The data were used to evaluate two projective geometry models for prediction of glideslope control during an aircraft approach to landing. These models did not permit an entirely satisfactory account of the data. We conclude that the landing approach is guided by visual properties other than those entered into these models. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. All right reserved.</abstract>"
1991,United States,Display Formatting Techniques for Improving Situation Awareness in the Aircraft Cockpit,"<title>Display Formatting Techniques for Improving Situation Awareness in the Aircraft Cockpit</title> <abstract>Three current display design issues are discussed and applied to the design and modification of primary flight and navigation instruments in the context of a situation awareness assessment. These are (a) display perspective (twodimensional vs. three-dimensional), (b) frame of reference (inside-out vs. outside-in), and (c) visual momentum (monochrome vs. color). A fixed-wing, low-fidelity flight simulation contrasted a planar inside-out pilot-referenced display with a planar outside-in world-referenced display and an outside-in three-dimensional perspective display. Eleven flight-naive subjects flew each display, with and without color coding, to approach several waypoints located in three-dimensional space. Situation awareness, as measured by flight performance and recovery from disorientation events, was best maintained with the planar outside-in display, whereas color coding improved performance on the planar inside-out display. Limitations of the perspective display were suggested by its ambiguity of distance judgments, although this display supported a strategy of more simultaneous control in both pitch and roll axes. The results are discussed within the context of previous research and current aviation display design issues. © 1991 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. All right reserved.</abstract>"

Research on operational use of data-link technology has been underway for well over 10 years. From this work, potentially useful data exist that remain largely unexploited for purposes of operational development. This article reviews the simulation literature on data-link communication between controllers and pilots to synthesize a base of useful, generalizable knowledge. General effects of the data-link technology on the volume, speed, and timing of air traffic control communications are analyzed for their operational significance. The analytic framework depicts data-link effectiveness as interdependent with operational context, procedures and applications, and human-interface design. Current research leaves many questions unanswered but consistently indicates that the combination of voice and data-link communication outperforms each medium used by itself. Issues are raised for research and implementation. Presumably, the ideal [communication medium] would combine the precision, conciseness, and freedom from ambiguity of algebraic notation, with the effortless congeniality of mans everyday speech.

2026,United States,Investigating Transfer of Input Device Practice on Psychomotor Performance in an Aviation Selection Test,"<title>Investigating Transfer of Input Device Practice on Psychomotor Performance in an Aviation Selection Test</title> <abstract>Objective: We explored transfer of learning from brief practice with different input devices in the Navy’s Performance Based Measures Battery (PBM), a psychomotor subset of the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB). Background: The PBM is a set of computerized tests used as a part of the ASTB to select aviators in the U.S. military. Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick and throttle used on the PBM. Method: Our between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video. Results: The results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM’s two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device. Conclusion: The results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This indicates that transfer effects from alternative input devices depend in part on properties of the task. Application: This research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection. © 2025 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society</abstract>"

Analyzing psychological reactions and travel attitudes of Chinese social media users post-aviation accidents through text mining</title> <abstract>Background: Commercial air travel is essential to modern society, but aviation accidents can have profound psychological impacts. The public's emotional responses and attitudes toward air travel are shaped by factors such as the severity of the incident and its social repercussions. Objectives: The study analyzes how the Chinese public's concerns, emotional responses, attributions, and attitudes toward air travel change following aviation accidents with varying severity and social impact. Additionally, it extends the application of the emotion-social information model in disaster scenarios and online behavior, providing valuable insights for crisis management. Method: The study employs the LDA topic model to identify public concerns, sentiment analysis with an affective dictionary, and Naive Bayes for emotional attribution. Comments before and after the incidents were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank tests to assess changes in attitudes toward air travel. Results: Public attention focused on victims, causes, and crew responses. Severe accidents elicited sadness, while less severe incidents prompted disgust and fear. Positive societal impacts from accidents improved emotions but did not significantly affect travel attitudes. Negative emotions led to a notable shift in attitudes toward air travel, while positive emotions had a limited effect. Conclusions: The study provides valuable insights into the emotional dynamics following aviation accidents, enhancing the understanding of the emotion-social information model. It highlights the lasting impact of negative emotions on travel attitudes and the limited influence of positive emotions, with implications for psychological interventions and crisis management. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd</abstract>"
2025,United States,Comparison Between Scene-Independent and Scene-Dependent Eye Metrics in Assessing Psychomotor Skills,"<title>Comparison Between Scene-Independent and Scene-Dependent Eye Metrics in Assessing Psychomotor Skills</title> <abstract>Objective: This study aims to compare the relative sensitivity between scene-independent and scene-dependent eye metrics in assessing trainees' performance in simulated psychomotor tasks. Background: Eye metrics have been extensively studied for skill assessment and training in psychomotor tasks, including aviation, driving, and surgery. These metrics can be categorized as scene-independent or scene-dependent, based on whether predefined areas of interest are considered. There is a paucity of direct comparisons between these metric types, particularly in their ability to assess performance during early training. Method: Thirteen medical students practiced the peg transfer task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. Scene-independent and scene-dependent eye metrics, completion time, and tool motion metrics were derived from eye-tracking data and task videos. K-means clustering of nine eye metrics identified three groups of practice trials with similar gaze behaviors, corresponding to three performance levels verified by completion time and tool motion metrics. A random forest model using eye metrics estimated classification accuracy and determined the feature importance of the eye metrics. Results: Scene-dependent eye metrics demonstrated a clearer linear trend with performance levels than scene-independent metrics. The random forest model achieved 88.59% accuracy, identifying the top four predictors of performance as scene-dependent metrics, whereas the two least effective predictors were scene-independent metrics. Conclusion: Scene-dependent eye metrics are overall more sensitive than scene-independent ones for assessing trainee performance in simulated psychomotor tasks. Application: The study’s findings are significant for advancing eye metrics in psychomotor skill assessment and training, enhancing operator competency, and promoting safe operations. © 2024 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.</abstract>"
2025,Singapore,Psychological resilience among emergency medical teams in Singapore,"<title>Psychological resilience among emergency medical teams in Singapore</title> <abstract>Problem: Emergency medical teams (EMTs) responding to mass casualty incidents attend to casualties in a chaotic, high-pressure and resource-limited environment that is vastly different from their day-to-day work. The nature of mass casualty incidents and the work environment can impact psychological resilience, but the psychological resilience of members of EMTs has not been evaluated. Context: In Singapore, EMTs are deployed from public hospitals, polyclinics and the Singapore Red Cross to disaster sites, where they triage, stabilize and treat casualties before evacuating them to public hospitals for further management. Action: Twenty-four members of EMTs responded to a cross-sectional survey based on a psychological resilience tool developed for health-care rescuers involved in mass casualty incidents to evaluate their psychological resilience after a full-scale exercise involving an aviation accident. Respondents completed a psychological resilience tool that was developed by experts in disaster work and research using a modified Delphi approach. There were 27 items across eight domains: optimism, altruism, preparations for disaster rescue, social support, perceived control, self-efficacy, coping strategies and positive growth. Outcome: The key observations from the survey were that (i) staff demonstrated a strong sense of altruism and had good social support; (ii) staff were not confident about their preparedness, and this led to a lack of optimism, perceived control and ability to deal with emotions; and (iii) it was necessary for respondents to reflect on their experience to find meaning to support growth after the deployment. Discussion: Optimizing casualty survival and outcomes during mass casualty incidents requires not only excellent procedural training and robust standard operating procedures and work processes but also dedicated efforts to enhance the psychological resilience of members of EMTs. © 2025, World Health Organization.

Here, we explore how this insight can lead to a deeper understanding of real-world behavior. We look specifically at three case studies from the history of commercial aviation disasters. In our analysis we combine Baron’s direct social perception strategy with the theoretical principles of the distributed cognition approach to functional group activity. We suggest that these approaches are deeply compatible, and that future work is needed to ground cognitive study of team activities in the analysis of the perceptual information available to the actors. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study examined whether internship experience influences aviation students’ career motivation and professional attitude through the mediating role of professional identity. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 414 aviation service students using validated psychological measures. Mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS Model 4 with 5,000 bootstrap samples. Gender and first-choice major were included as covariates. Results: Higher-quality internship experiences significantly enhanced students’ professional identity, which strongly predicted both career motivation (β = 0.50***) and professional attitude (β = 0.48***). Professional identity partially mediated the effect of internship experience on career motivation (indirect effect = 0.30) and fully mediated its effect on professional attitude (indirect effect = 0.24**). Discussion: These findings demonstrate that internships shape students’ long-term career outcomes primarily by strengthening their professional identity rather than through direct experiential effects alone. Professional identity is therefore a critical psychological mechanism in aviation talent development, emphasizing the need for identity-supportive internship programs. © © 2025 Wang.</abstract>"

Additionally, it examines the impact of sociodemographic variables on the manifestation of silence and its association with psychological safety. The research included 486 employees from a Portuguese aviation company. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods with SmartPLS. The results indicate a negative correlation between psychological safety and all types of silence, suggesting that psychologically safe work environments reduce employees' tendency to withhold concerns. Furthermore, significant effects of sex, education, and seniority were observed in the adoption of silence. Based on these findings, the study proposes innovative strategies to enhance psychological safety and mitigate silence, fostering a more open environment for communication, innovation, and active employee participation. © 2025 University of Algarve.

However, the internal mechanism of how rumination affects psychological resilience, particularly the chain mediating effect of proactive coping and generalized anxiety, has not been thoroughly explored in high-stress populations. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, 1,235 flight students from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China were surveyed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to gather data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and the Bootstrap method were used to test the chain mediating effect. Results: Rumination exhibited a significant negative correlation with psychological resilience (r = −0.365, p < 0.01) and proactive coping (r = −0.285, p < 0.01), and a positive correlation with generalized anxiety (r = 0.337, p < 0.01). Psychological resilience showed a positive correlation with proactive coping (r = 0.727, p < 0.01) and a negative correlation with generalized anxiety (r = −0.270, p < 0.01). Mediation effect analysis revealed that proactive coping and generalized anxiety each played a partial mediating role between rumination and psychological resilience. The mediating effect comprised three paths: “rumination → proactive coping → psychological resilience,” “rumination → generalized anxiety → psychological resilience,” and “rumination → proactive coping → generalized anxiety → psychological resilience,” with effect sizes of 91.22, 7.80, and 0.98%, respectively. Conclusion: Rumination in civil aviation flight students not only directly impairs psychological resilience but also indirectly influences it through the chain mechanism of inhibiting proactive coping and intensifying generalized anxiety. Consequently, it is recommended that civil aviation psychological training focus on cognitive-behavioral interventions to interrupt the activation of rumination, foster adaptive coping strategies, and construct a psychological resilience development model tailored to the specific demands of the aviation profession. © © 2025 Liao, Wang, Liu and Hu.</abstract>"
2024,China,Exploring the measurement of psychological resilience in Chinese civil aviation pilots based on generalizability theory and item response theory,"<title>Exploring the measurement of psychological resilience in Chinese civil aviation pilots based on generalizability theory and item response theory</title> <abstract>Understanding and accurately measuring resilience among Chinese civil aviation pilots is imperative, especially concerning the psychological impact of distressing events on their well-being and aviation safety. Despite the necessity, a validated and tailored measurement tool specific to this demographic is absent. Addressing this gap, this study built on the widely used CD-RISC-25 to analyze and modify its applicability to Chinese civil aviation pilots. Utilizing CD-RISC-25 survey data from 231 Chinese pilots, correlational and differential analyses identified items 3 and 20 as incongruent with this population's resilience profile. Subsequently, factor analysis derived a distinct two-factor resilience psychological framework labeled “Decisiveness” and “Adaptability”, which diverged from the structure found in American female pilots and the broader Chinese populace. Additionally, to further accurately identify the measurement characteristics of this 2-factor measurement model, this study introduced Generalized Theory and Item Response Theory, two modern measurement analysis theories, to comprehensively analyze the overall reliability of the measurement and issues with individual items. Results showed that the 2-factor model exhibited high reliability, with generalizability coefficient reaching 0.89503 and dependability coefficient reaching 0.88496, indicating the 2-factor measurement questionnaire can be effectively utilized for relative and absolute comparison of Chinese civil aviation pilot resilience. However, items in Factor 2 provided less information and have larger room for optimization than those in Factor 1, implying item option redesign may be beneficial. Consequently, this study culminates in the creation of a more accurate and reliable two-factor psychological resilience measurement tool tailored for Chinese civil aviation pilots, while exploring directions for optimization. By facilitating early identification of individuals with lower resilience and enabling the evaluation of intervention efficacy, this tool aims to positively impact pilot psychological health and aviation safety in the context of grief and trauma following distressing events. © 2024, The Author(s).</abstract>"
2024,Spain,Inter-individual differences and task familiarity in illusion of control,"<title>Inter-individual differences and task familiarity in illusion of control</title> <abstract>Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of task content in the illusion of control effect (i.e. the tendency to overestimate our chances of success beyond the objective probabilities). A secondary exploratory objective was to analyze individual differences in task performance. Methods: A total of 88 participants (36 aerospace engineers and 52 undergraduate psychology students) participated in this experiment performing a standard drug-related contingency judgment task (with a fictitious drug that could be effective for a fictitious disease) and a novel analogue task with aerospace content. In both tasks, there was a null contingency between treatment and recovery. However, the chance of spontaneous recovery was 70%, a baseline rate which tends to produce strong illusion of control effects in null contingency setups. The participants were tasked to identify the treatment effectivity (the normative answer was no effectivity at all). Results: The data showed a strong illusion of control with no significant difference between groups and tasks. A non-negligible number of participants displayed inefficient strategies during task performance. Discussion: Both tasks produced comparable results with no significant differences. Our data suggests that inter-individual effects need to be considered in future research and measures of central tendency must be used with caution. © Vera, Orgaz, Contreras, Montoro, 2024.</abstract>"
2023,China,Consensus on the pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in Chinese pilots: a Delphi study,"<title>Consensus on the pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in Chinese pilots: a Delphi study</title> <abstract>Background: Appropriate medication is very important for pilots with acute stress disorder. Improper medication can not only affect the physical and mental health of the pilots but can also endanger flight safety. Hence, we aimed to quickly and effectively relieve symptoms and restore cognitive function by forming a consensus of Chinese experts on the pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in pilots using the Delphi method. Methods: Relevant literature was searched to enumerate the current status of pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in pilots, followed by two rounds of expert consultation and discussion according to the listed status of the survey using the Delphi method. A descriptive statistical method was used to analyze the basic information, authority coefficients, concentration of opinions, and survey items of the experts to develop a consensus on the pharmacological treatment of acute stress disorder in pilots. Results: A total of 16 experts in psychiatry, pharmacology, and aerospace medicine from different provinces and cities across China were invited for consultation. The recovery rate of the two rounds of consultation was 100%, and the expert authority coefficients were 0.897 and 0.906, respectively. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance of indicators at all levels was 0.564–0.594 (p < 0.01). Based on the number of votes received, alprazolam tablets (16), eszopiclone tablets (15), and lorazepam tablets (14) were recommended for the treatment of excitatory psychomotor symptoms of acute stress disorder; paroxetine tablets (15) and sertraline tablets (15) were available for psychomotor depressive symptoms; olanzapine tablets (15), olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets (14), and quetiapine fumarate tablets (14) were selected for psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: This study formed a consensus on rapid and effective pharmacological treatment for different symptoms of acute stress disorder pilots, which provides a reference for clinical treatment. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</abstract>"
2022,China,Investigation of pilots' mental health and analysis of influencing factors in China: based on structural equation model,"<title>Investigation of pilots' mental health and analysis of influencing factors in China: based on structural equation model</title> <abstract>Background: Pilots' physical and mental health might be significant contributing factors to flight safety. Exploring pilots’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is crucial for aviation security, health management, and psychological security. This study aimed to explore HRQoL and mental health of pilots and analyze the health characteristics and influencing factors, such as demographic data, personality traits, social support, and resilience. It may provide data for a theoretical basis for aviation security work and health management strategy. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using quantitative approaches. Two hundred twenty male pilots with an average age of 33.31 years participated. They answered a social demographic questionnaire, Symptom Checklist-90, Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire, Perceived social support scale, Connor-Davidson resilience scale, and Big Five Personality Inventories, whose data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mediating effect of personality factors between resilience and the HRQoL of pilots was observed. Personality factors also mediated the relationship between social support and the mental health of pilots. Conclusion: Pilots’ mental health and quality of life need to be taken seriously. Social support, resilience, and personality factors affect pilots’ mental health and quality of life. © 2022, The Author(s).</abstract>"

Our case study of 30 sequential aviation patients consists of demographic, clinical, and aviation characteristics plus a 10-year follow-up. Relatively few pilots and other aviation workers self-identified their psychiatric condition. Aviation outcomes associated with psychiatric disorder included personnel injury and/or aircraft damage (three cases), imminent risk without injury or damage (nine cases), impaired aviation functioning without imminent risk (15 cases), and neither risk nor psychiatric disorder or impairment (three cases). Mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders comprised the most common diagnoses. Ten years later, 23 patients were employed (21 in aviation); seven were disabled or deceased. General psychiatrists will find aviation cases clinically familiar but requiring added evaluation for aviation safety and potential interaction with the Federal Aviation Agency and airline supervisors. © © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, we report a novel case involving a naval helicopter pilot who sustained a helicopter propeller rotor blade injury. Case Report: We describe a case involving a pilot struck on the head by a helicopter rotor blade. He received care from medical staff shortly after the injury and was en route to the nearest trauma center. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a comminuted fracture of the right occipital bone, with bone fragment retention in the right cerebral hemispheres. We performed an emergency right occipital craniotomy. The visual field patterns demonstrated right homonymous hemianopia when the patient was discharged. The patient underwent delayed titanium mesh cranioplasty about 3 months after the right occipital craniotomy. From discharge to 5 years, the patient had performed rehabilitation exercise for at least 3 days every week. The patient’s continued recovery was confirmed at the 5-year follow-up in 2019. The bilateral visual acuity was 20/20, and the right homonymous hemianopia problem also disappeared. In the same year, after a physical and psychological assessment by an aviation doctor, he was able to resume flying. Conclusions: This report has shown that despite safety regulations for military and civilian helicopter personnel, which include the wearing of helmets, helicopter rotor blade injuries still occur and can have long-term consequences due to the severity of head injury. © 2021, International Scientific Information, Inc..

2020,Israel,Psychological safety in aviation new product development teams: Case study of 737 max airplane,"<title>Psychological safety in aviation new product development teams: Case study of 737 max airplane</title> <abstract>The goal of current study is to discern the antecedents of two airplane accidents involving the Boeing MAX 737. The theory of normal accidents serves as a lens to comprehend the hazard stemming from MAX design with dissonance between two critical systems: engine propulsion and flight control. Cooper’s framework further delineates lack of psychological safety during prototype development from the project’s inception along six dimensions: management/supervision, safety systems, risk, work pressure, competence, and procedures/rules. The analysis indicates dearth of leadership commitment for a safety culture under time pressure and budget constraint. Our results corroborate the paramount importance of the pilot’s extensive simulator training in order to test the interaction between the innovative Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System and human behavior response time. Lessons gleaned from the study include three insights. First, the importance of meticulously testing a prototype during the new product development stage and the hazard stemming from improvisation to extend the life of outdated engineering design. Second, the necessity of regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, undergoing a modernization process by invigorating their ranks with data scientists attuned to 21st century skills in big data analytics. Third, FAA should diminish the delegation of self-certified permits to manufacturers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</abstract>"
2020,United States,"GeMini: A High-Resolution, Low-Resource, Gamma-Ray Spectrometer for Planetary Science Applications","<title>GeMini: A High-Resolution, Low-Resource, Gamma-Ray Spectrometer for Planetary Science Applications</title> <abstract>GeMini is a high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer designed for planetary-science exploration. GeMini serves as the basis for instruments being flown on three upcoming deep-space missions: NASA’s mission to the M-class asteroid (16) Psyche, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency sample-return mission to the moons of Mars, and NASA’s Dragonfly mission that will land on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. These science missions require high-resolution spectroscopy in a low-power, low-mass, rugged design that can survive in a variety of environments. GeMini addresses these needs by providing a cryogenically cooled crystal of high-purity germanium that can operate with as little as 10 to 20 watts, depending on the implementation and mission, and has a mass of less than 2 kg. GeMini helps determine the elemental composition of planetary bodies by measuring gamma rays emitted from the surface. This paper describes the mechanical, thermal, and electrical design of GeMini as well as its performance. It also describes testing that was performed to validate the design with respect to launch loads and radiation damage. Although the basic design of GeMini is common to all three missions, each planetary body has unique environmental conditions and mission specifications. This paper concludes by describing these upcoming missions and how GeMini is customized for each. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract>"

Such resources affect how we cope with stress and a sense of threat. The authors of this paper focus on people employed in the aviation sector, who work in the hard-to-cope environment of full automation, demanding working conditions and numerous stressors. The presented study fills a gap in the research on the psychological characteristics of the aviation sector. Moreover, a sense of stress/threat is described in the context of the high specificity of employees representing the 4.0 sector. Therefore, it provides additional insights into the psychological functioning of the employees in the aviation sector. The results show that both positive orientation and ego resilience might be seen as protective factors against a sense of threat and stress, while a type D personality is a risk factor of a higher level of those psychological states. The novelty of the presented research concerns a better understanding of the sense of stress/threat experienced by the employees in this sector, as well as verifying the relationships between psychological variables described in the literature as personal resources. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract>"

2019,Germany,The acceptance of CIRS among orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany—Significant gap between positive perception and actual implementation in daily routine,"<title>The acceptance of CIRS among orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany—Significant gap between positive perception and actual implementation in daily routine</title> <abstract>Purpose: Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States after malignant tumors and cardiovascular disease. Handling of errors becomes more and more eclectic due to the implementation of incident reporting systems and the use of checklists. Since 2015, any German hospital would have a critical incident reporting system (CIRS). The aim of this study is to discover the nationwide utilization and attitude toward CIRS of orthopedic and trauma surgeons. Methods: Between April 10, 2015 and May 22, 2015, a web-based questionnaire, which was designed by an expert team consisting of orthopedic and trauma surgeons, aeronautic human factors specialists, and psychologists (Lufthansa Aviation Training), was sent to all members of the German Society for Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery. The survey consisted of three questions regarding CIRS and its use in German hospitals. Results: A total of 669 orthopedic and trauma surgeons working in German hospitals completed the questionnaire. All participants rated CIRS as useful, although 71.3% of participants did not report a critical incident in the last 12 months. In that time period, only 13.4% of participating residents reported at least one incident, but 44.7% of chief physicians reported one incident within the same period. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that even though CIRS as a tool is positively appreciated by orthopedic and trauma surgeons working in German hospitals, many do not know about its existence at their own hospital. This can be a reason for the low number of critical incidents reported. © The Author(s) 2019.</abstract>"
2019,Germany,Is your mind set? - How are intra- and interpersonal competences dealt with in medical education? A multi-professional qualitative study,"<title>Is your mind set? - How are intra- and interpersonal competences dealt with in medical education? A multi-professional qualitative study</title> <abstract>Background: Professional intrapersonal and interpersonal competences (IICs) form an important part of medical expertise but are given little attention during clinical training. In other professional fields such as psychotherapy, education and aviation, training in IICs is an integral part of education and practice. In medicine, IICs tend to actually decline during studies. To date it is unclear why IICs are given less attention in medicine, despite evidence for their importance in the treatment process. In view of this, the study examined the role of IICs in the treatment process, the current situation of IIC training in medicine and, most importantly, the reasons for the comparatively low focus on IICs in the clinical training of medical students. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 experts from a variety of medical specialties and non-medical professions that provide a training with a stronger focus on IIC development. The interviews were evaluated using grounded theory. Results: The experts confirmed the idea that IICs are an equally important component in the treatment process, along with medical knowledge and technical skills. They also described large differences between the IICs possessed by physicians but noted a general developmental need. The key shortcoming was perceived to be a deep-seated defensiveness towards learning from mistakes and deficits e.g. through reflection and feedback. The interaction of different factors that seem to be reasons for this defensiveness and perpetuate it were identified: lack of support in dealing with insecurities in the face of responsibility; the notion of medicine as a science with the categories of right and wrong answers; and a range of pressures arising from the setting, such as hierarchical, economic and competition pressures. Conclusion: Our study showed, that the defensive attitude towards learning from mistakes and deficits especially in the field of IICs appears to be a subtle but powerful obstacle for implementing IICs in medical training, in contrast to other professional fields. This obstacle is sustained by various underlying barrier factors. We therefore propose that changes should be made within a cultural transformation targeting this defensive mindset and culture and its presumed reasons. © 2019 The Author(s).</abstract>"
2018,Norfolk Island - United States,Decompression sickness in the F/A-18C after atypical cabin pressure fluctuations,"<title>Decompression sickness in the F/A-18C after atypical cabin pressure fluctuations</title> <abstract>BACKGROUND: The spectrum of altitude decompression sickness (DCS) is evolving as more cases of atypical pressure fluctuations occur. This ongoing change makes it a difficult condition to diagnose and even more difficult to identify. Both Flight Surgeons and Undersea Medical Officers (UMOs) must keep DCS on the differential. These two cases describe altitude DCS after unique pressure patterns, with one at a markedly lower than expected altitude for DCS. CASE REPORT: Both cases occurred in the F/A-18C and resulted in DCS requiring hyperbaric chamber treatment. The aviator in case 1 experienced an over-pressurization to an unknown depth with a subsequent rapid decompression during a carrier approach at 600 ft (182.9 m) above sea level. The aviator in case 2 experienced cabin pressure fluctuations between 9000 ft (2743.2 m) and 18,000 ft (5486.4 m). Both cases demonstrate the progression of DCS after partial treatment on ground-level oxygen therapy, and the case sequence illustrates how evaluations and protocols changed with experience. DISCUSSION: Decompression sickness is difficult to identify since it does not have a diagnostic test. These cases were even more difficult because of subtle exam findings, reliance on subjective symptoms, and atypical pressure profiles. Environmental, physiological, and psychosocial factors specific to the aviation community can delay the diagnosis and treatment. Descending in altitude and using in-flight emergency oxygen or ground-level oxygen partially treats and masks symptoms for both the aviator and the physician. The Flight Surgeons' integration within the squadron and collaboration with UMOs is important to identify the first signs of DCS and decrease time to treatment. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"

This review aims to consolidate literature describing the evidence for use of eye-tracking as an adjunct to traditional teaching methods in medical education. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in line with STORIES guidelines. A search of EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO, TRIP database, and Science Direct was conducted until January 2017. Studies describing the use of eye-tracking in the training, assessment, and feedback of clinicians were included in the review. Results: Thirty-three studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Three studies were based on the use of gaze training, three studies on the changes in gaze behavior during the learning curve, 17 studies on clinical assessment and six studies focused on the use of eye-tracking methodology as a feedback tool. The studies demonstrated feasibility and validity in the use of eye-tracking as a training and assessment method. Conclusions: Overall, eye-tracking methodology has contributed significantly to the training, assessment, and feedback practices used in the clinical setting. The technology provides reliable quantitative data, which can be interpreted to give an indication of clinical skill, provide training solutions and aid in feedback and reflection. This review provides a detailed summary of evidence relating to eye-tracking methodology and its uses as a training method, changes in visual gaze behavior during the learning curve, eye-tracking methodology for proficiency assessment and its uses as a feedback tool. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.</abstract>"
2018,Turkey,Using eye-movement events to determine the mental workload of surgical residents,"<title>Using eye-movement events to determine the mental workload of surgical residents</title> <abstract>These days, eye-tracking is one of the promising technologies used in different fields such as aviation, arts, sports, psychology and driving for several purposes. Even though it is being used for health purposes, studies involving eye-tracking are rare in the field of endo-neuro-surgery. This study aims to use this technology to promote our understanding of the effect related to computer-based instructional materials on mental workload of endo-neurosurgery residents. Four computer-based simulation scenarios are developed based on skill develop-ment requirements of endo-neurosurgery residents. Two of them were designed as general models and the other two as simulated surgical models. During these surgery procedures, in real settings, surgical residents need to use their both hands simultaneously to control the endoscope and the operational tool in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, to shed light on the participants' behaviors, these scenarios are performed with dominant-hand, non-dominant hand and, finally with both-hands using haptic interfaces. Twenty-three residents volun-teered in this study. Their eye-movements were recorded while performing the scenarios. According to the results of this study, when performing the simulated surgical models, an increase in the participants' mental workload was recorded when compared to the other scenarios. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the eye-movements of surgical residents can provide insights about the anticipated level of difficulty about the skill-based tasks. This information might be very critical to properly design and organize instructional materials for endo-neurosurgery, and also to better guide and evaluate the progress of trainees in com-puter simulation-based skill training environments. © 2018, International Group for Eye Movement Research.</abstract>"

2017,United States,"Postmortem fluid and tissue concentrations of THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH","<title>Postmortem fluid and tissue concentrations of THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH</title> <abstract>Marijuana is the most commonly abused illicit drug worldwide. Marijuana is used for its euphoric and relaxing properties. However, marijuana use has been shown to result in impaired memory, cognitive skills and psychomotor function. The Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute conducts toxicological analysis on aviation fatalities. Due to severe trauma associated with aviation accidents, blood is not always available; therefore, the laboratory must rely on specimens other than blood for toxicological analysis in ~30-40% of cases. However, the postmortem distribution of cannabinoids has not been well characterized. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the distribution of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and its metabolites, 11-hydroxytetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) and THC-COOH, in postmortem fluid and tissue specimens from 11 fatal aviation accident cases (2014-2015) previously found positive for cannabinoids. Specimens evaluated, when available, included: blood, urine, vitreous humor, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, muscle, brain, heart and bile. We developed and validated (following SWGTOX guidelines) a sensitive and robust method using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH in postmortem fluids and tissues. The method readily identified and quantified these cannabinoids in postmortem fluids and tissues below 1 ng/mL. Qualitative cannabinoid results within each case were comparable between blood and non-blood specimens. However, there was no consistent distribution of the cannabinoids between blood and any other fluids or tissues. Therefore, while quantitative interpretation of nonblood postmortem fluid and tissues samples is not prudent, a majority of the non-blood specimens tested could be suitable alternative/supplemental choices for qualitative cannabinoid detection. © The Author 2017.

2017,United States,"If the framingham heart study did not invent the risk factor, who did?","<title>If the framingham heart study did not invent the risk factor, who did?</title> <abstract>Most historians, epidemiologists, and physicians credit the Framingham Heart Study for introducing the term “risk factor” to public health and medicine. Many add that the term came from life insurance companies. This familiar history is incorrect. Taking advantage of the expanding availability of digitized and full-text searchable journals, textbooks, newspapers, and other sources, we have uncovered a deeper and broader history. Antecedent concepts (such as risk, factor, predisposition) have ancient roots. “Risk factor” began to appear in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in many industries, not just in insurance but also in finance, agriculture, and manufacturing. The term appeared in the occupational health literature in 1922. It reappeared in the 1950s in many different areas of medicine including psychiatry, surgery, cardiology, epidemiology, and aerospace medicine. Furthermore, despite the influential appearance of “risk factor” in a 1961 Framingham Heart Study publication, the term did not gain momentum in medicine and public health until the mid-1970s. While our analysis is not exhaustive, our findings are extensive enough to require a substantial revision to the history of the risk factor. © 2017 by Johns Hopkins University Press.</abstract>"

2014,United Kingdom,Habituation of the cold shock response may include a signifi cant perceptual component,"<title>Habituation of the cold shock response may include a signifi cant perceptual component</title> <abstract>Introduction: Accidental immersion in cold water is a risk factor for many occupations. Habituation to cold-water immersion (CWI) is one practical means of reducing the cold shock response (CSR) on immersion. We investigated whether repeated thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) induced a perceptual habituation (i.e., could lessen perceived threat and anxiety) and consequently reduce the CSR on subsequent CWI. Methods: There were 12 subjects who completed seven 7-min head-out immersions. Immersions one and seven were CWIs [15.0 (0.1)°C], and immersions two to six were TWI [34.9 (0.10)°C]. Anxiety (20-cm visual analogue scale) and the cardiorespiratory responses [heart rate (f <inf>c</inf> ), respiratory frequency (f <inf>R</inf> ), tidal volume (V <inf>T</inf> ), and minute ventilation ( V <inf>E</inf> )] to immersion were measured throughout. Data were compared within subject between conditions using ANOVA to an alpha level of 0.05. Results: Acute anxiety was signifi cantly reduced after repeated exposure to the immersion scenario (i.e., TWI): CWI-1: 6.3 (4.4) cm; and CWI-2: 4.5 (4.0) cm [condition mean (SD)]. These differences did not infl uence the peak in the CSR. The f <inf>c</inf> , f <inf>R</inf> , and .V E responses were similar between CWI-1 and CWI-2. V <inf>T</inf> response was signifi cantly lower in CWI- 2; mean (SD) across the immersion: CWI-1 1.27 (0.17) vs. CWI-2 1.11 (0.2) L. Discussion: Repeated TWI lessened the anxiety associated with CWI (perceptual habituation). This had a negligible effect on the primary components of the CSR, but did lower V <inf>T</inf> , which may reduce the volume of any aspirated water in an emergency situation. Reducing the threat appraisal of an environmental stressor may be a useful biproduct of survival training, thereby minimizing psychophysiological strain. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2014,Canada,The good and bad of group conformity: A call for a new programme of research in medical education,"<title>The good and bad of group conformity: A call for a new programme of research in medical education</title> <abstract>Context: Given that a significant portion of medical education occurs in various social settings (small groups, large classes, clinical environments), it is critical to examine how group members interact. One type of influence on these interactions is conformity, whereby an individual changes his or her own behaviour to match incorrect responses of others in a group. Conformity to peer pressure has been replicated in experimental research conducted in many countries over the last 60 years. There is newly emerging empirical evidence of this effect in medical education, suggesting that subtle motivations and pressures within a group may prevent students from challenging or questioning information that seems incorrect. Objectives: This narrative review aims to present an overview of theory and findings in research into conformity in the fields of social psychology, business, sociology and aviation theory to demonstrate its direct relevance to medical education and the health professions. Methods: We searched online databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and ProQuest) from the University of Calgary catalogue. We also searched citations in articles reviewed and references provided by colleagues. We limited our narrative review to publications released between 1950 and 2012. Results: Group conformity behaviour may be one of a number of communication challenges associated with interprofessional care, and may represent a factor contributing to the burden of adverse events. This paper calls for a new programme of research into conformity in medical education that provides systematic empirical evidence of its relevance and applications in education, health care and practice. Conclusions: This review reveals decades of anecdotal and empirical evidence that conformity is a pervasive phenomenon across disciplines. Further research is needed to elucidate which situations pose the greatest risk for the occurrence of conformity, how to manage it in practice and its implications for patient safety. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</abstract>"
2013,United Kingdom,Evaluating stress as a challenge is associated with superior attentional control and motor skill performance: Testing the predictions of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat,"<title>Evaluating stress as a challenge is associated with superior attentional control and motor skill performance: Testing the predictions of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat</title> <abstract>The biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat (Blascovich, 2008) suggests that individuals who evaluate a performance situation as a challenge will perform better than those who evaluate it as a threat. However, limited research has examined (a) the influence of challenge and threat evaluations on learned motor performance under pressure and (b) the attentional processes by which this effect occurs. In the present study 52 novices performed a motor task (laparoscopic surgery), for which optimal visual attentional control has been established. Participants performed a Baseline trial (when the task was novel) and were then trained to proficiency before performing under pressurized conditions designed to increase anxiety (Pressure). At Baseline, regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between challenge/threat evaluations and the outcome variables (performance, cardiovascular response, and visual attention). At Pressure, hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for the degree of learning) were performed to examine the relationship between challenge/threat evaluations and the outcome variables. At both Baseline and Pressure tests evaluating the task as more of a challenge was associated with more effective attentional control and superior performance. In the Baseline test, evaluating the task as more of a challenge was associated with differential cardiovascular responses. Although there is some support for an attentional explanation of differential performance effects, additional analyses did not reveal mediators of the relationship between challenge/threat evaluations and motor performance. The findings have implications for the training and performance of motor skills in pressurized environments (e.g., surgery, sport, aviation) © 2013 American Psychological Association.</abstract>"
2012,United States,Outcome measure to assess head-down bed rest subject performance,"<title>Outcome measure to assess head-down bed rest subject performance</title> <abstract>Background: The purpose of the present study was to develop an objective outcome measure to assess the performance of head-down bed rest subjects. The rationale behind the development was that the current outcome measure is subjective and dependent upon how much the clinical psychologist knows about subject behaviors during the study to rate them accurately. Methods: The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) were developed through the use of the critical incident technique, along with traditional BARS development procedures, and the use of focus groups. Results: Use of these methodologies yielded 86 usable critical incidents, which were used as anchors for the scales. Discussion: Further research will be necessary to determine whether or not associations exist between data from the BARS and psychological screening data. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.</abstract>"
2008,Germany - Russian Federation,De-individualized psychophysiological strain assessment during a flight simulation test-Validation of a space methodology,"<title>De-individualized psychophysiological strain assessment during a flight simulation test-Validation of a space methodology</title> <abstract>For the evaluation of an operator's skill reliability indicators of work quality as well as of psychophysiological states during the work have to be considered. The herein presented methodology and measurement equipment were developed and tested in numerous terrestrial and space experiments using a simulation of a spacecraft docking on a space station. However, in this study the method was applied to a comparable terrestrial task-the flight simulator test (FST) used in the DLR selection procedure for ab initio pilot applicants for passenger airlines. This provided a large amount of data for a statistical verification of the space methodology. For the evaluation of the strain level of applicants during the FST psychophysiological measurements were used to construct a ""psychophysiological arousal vector"" (PAV) which is sensitive to various individual reaction patterns of the autonomic nervous system to mental load. Its changes and increases will be interpreted as ""strain"". In the first evaluation study, 614 subjects were analyzed. The subjects first underwent a calibration procedure for the assessment of their autonomic outlet type (AOT) and on the following day they performed the FST, which included three tasks and was evaluated by instructors applying well-established and standardized rating scales. This new method will possibly promote a wide range of other future applications in aviation and space psychology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"

The analysis of psychological features in pilots with a history of attempted suicide showed a neurotic type of maladaptation formed on the basis of the domination of hyposthenic traits in the personality structure. Neurotic behavior, pessimism, increased anxiety, and introversion that had become acute under the specific social and occupational conditions transformed into depressive signs and avoidance of social problems. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2007.</abstract>"
2007,Germany - Russian Federation,Performance assessment in a flight simulator test-Validation of a space psychology methodology,"<title>Performance assessment in a flight simulator test-Validation of a space psychology methodology</title> <abstract>The objective assessment of operator performance in hand controlled docking of a spacecraft on a space station has 30 years of tradition and is well established. In the last years the performance assessment was successfully combined with a psycho-physiological approach for the objective assessment of the levels of physiological arousal and psychological load. These methods are based on statistical reference data. For the enhancement of the statistical power of the evaluation methods, both were actually implemented into a comparable terrestrial task: the flight simulator test of DLR in the selection procedure for ab initio pilot applicants for civil airlines. In the first evaluation study 134 male subjects were analysed. Subjects underwent a flight simulator test including three tasks, which were evaluated by instructors applying well-established and standardised rating scales. The principles of the performance algorithms of the docking training were adapted for the automated flight performance assessment. They are presented here. The increased human errors under instrument flight conditions without visual feedback required a manoeuvre recognition algorithm before calculating the deviation of the flown track from the given task elements. Each manoeuvre had to be evaluated independently of former failures. The expert rated performance showed a highly significant correlation with the automatically calculated performance for each of the three tasks: r<inf>t 1</inf> = .883, r<inf>t 2</inf> = .874, r<inf>t 3</inf> = .872, respectively. An automated algorithm successfully assessed the flight performance. This new method will possibly provide a wide range of other future applications in aviation and space psychology. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</abstract>"
2007,United States,Alcohol screening instruments and psychiatric evaluation outcomes in military aviation personnel,"<title>Alcohol screening instruments and psychiatric evaluation outcomes in military aviation personnel</title> <abstract>Introduction: Alcohol-related disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in the aviation population. Efforts to effectively screen aviators for these disorders are continually sought, as under-diagnosis may negatively impact aviation safety. This study evaluates screening tools that have been validated in non-aviators in terms of their utility for aviator patients. Methods: There were 111 male aviation patients (27 ± 7 yr) referred for psychiatric evaluation at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute who completed the Self-Administered Alcohol Screening Test (SAAST), the Alcohol-Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Common Alcohol Logistical Scale-Revised (CAL-R) prior to evaluation by a staff psychiatrist or psychologist. Results: There were 40 patients who were qualified psychiatrically with no diagnosis and 49 patients who were disqualified for psychiatric reasons due to a non alcohol-related diagnosis. The remaining 22 patients were disqualified for psychiatric reasons with an alcohol-related diagnosis. The optimal aviator cut-off scores were consistent with those of the general population, although the cut-off score used for the SAAST was set at the published sub-threshold level to provide greater sensitivity. The sensitivity/specificity values for the SAAST, AUDIT, and CAL-R were 59%/94%, 46%/96%, and 68%/81%, respectively. Conclusion: The psychometrically sophisticated CAL-R is sensitive, specific, and has good negative predictive value, although its use requires a psychologist and its availability is limited. The SAAST and AUDIT can be administered by a flight surgeon or aviation medical examiner (AME). Given the higher sensitivity of the SAAST it may be the most beneficial if administered first. The AUDIT can be used as a follow-up diagnostic test given its higher specificity. Copyright © by Aerospace Medical Association.</abstract>"
2004,Austria,Evaluation of a spatial disorientation simulator training for jet pilots,"<title>Evaluation of a spatial disorientation simulator training for jet pilots</title> <abstract>To evaluate the efficiency of a disorientation-recovery program using the Airfox DISO flight simulator (Disorientation Trainer, AMST Systemtechnik GmbH, Austria), 26 jet pilots were tested. The pilots were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: Training, Awareness, or Control group. The training for the Training group included demonstration trials of the disorientation phenomena Gyro Spin, Leans, Dark Take-off, Expectation Error, Black Hole Approach, and False Horizon (awareness phase) and additional reorientation exercises (training phase). Pilots of the Awareness group also received the awareness phase, but instead of the training phase, they had the control condition free flight. All 26 pilots attended a test, which included profiles of disorientation elements. The whole procedure took about 7 hours per pilot. Aviation performance, psychological, and physiological data were measured. Results contribute to answer the more theoretical question how physiologically determined perceptual illusions and contradicting perceptual inputs to the mental picture of the situation interact to change or destroy situation awareness. Physiological stress occurred during the simulator exercises (e.g. Black Hole Approach) as indicated by significant changes in heart rate. Performance ratings show positive effects for the Training group. The Training group recovered more quickly, confirming these ratings. © 2004, FAA Academy.</abstract>"
2004,United States,The use of empirical data sources in HRA,"<title>The use of empirical data sources in HRA</title> <abstract>This paper presents a review of available information related to human performance to support Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) performed for nuclear power plants (NPPs). A number of data sources are identified as potentially useful. These include NPP licensee event reports, augmented inspection team reports, operator requalification data, results from the literature in experimental psychology, and the Aviation Safety Reporting System. The paper discusses how utilizing such information improves our capability to model and quantify human performance. In particular, the paper discusses how information related to performance shaping factors can be extracted from empirical data to determine their size effect, their relative effects, as well as their interactions. The paper concludes that appropriate use of existing sources can help addressing some of the important issues we are currently facing in HRA. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</abstract>"
2001,,Psychiatric considerations in military aerospace medicine,"<title>Psychiatric considerations in military aerospace medicine</title> <abstract>Military aerospace medicine requires a psychiatric selection and certification process that determines not only the absence of significant mental disorders, but also the presence of positive qualities in the realms of motivation, ability and stability: not all normal people are fit to fly. Other issues of aerospace psychiatry involve maintenance of mental resilience and hardiness during a flying career, aeromedical decisions about when to remove from flight duties and when to return, criteria for waivers for psychiatric conditions, use of medications for treatment of psychiatric symptoms, questions of substance abuse, and research in such areas as genetics. This report reviews the basis for military aerospace psychiatry, primarily as practiced in the United States Air Force (USAF), and presents some of its underlying principles as they apply to clinical situations.</abstract>"

Staying and working in a space habitat is connected with exposure to a lot of different stressors all of which may entail detrimental effects on human performance and psychological well-being of astronauts. However, the psychological impact of the extreme environmental conditions in space and particularly its impact on mental performance of astronauts has only recently become an object of systematic research.

Methods. - The IDEALS concept of design was used to identify specifications for the event-reporting system, and a Delphi and subsequent nominal group technique meetings were used to reach consensus on the development of the system. An interdisciplinary panel of experts from aviation safety, nuclear power, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and education and representatives of major transfusion medicine organizations participated in the development process. Setting. - Three blood centers and three hospitals transfusion services implemented the reporting system. Results. - A working prototype event- reporting system was recommended and implemented. The system has seven components: detection, selection, description, classification, computation, interpretation, and local evaluation. Its unique features include no-fault reporting initiated by the individual discovering the event, who submits a report that is investigated by local quality assurance personnel and forwarded to a nonregulatory central system for computation and interpretation. Conclusions. - An event-reporting system incorporated into present quality assurance and risk management efforts can help organizations address system structural and procedural weakness where the potential for errors can adversely affect health care outcomes. Input from the end users of the system as well as from external experts should enable this reporting system to serve as a useful model for others who may develop event-reporting systems in other medical domains.</abstract>"
1997,United States,Panic with a twist: An unusual presentation of combined psychiatric and neurologic symptoms in a tactical jet aviator,"<title>Panic with a twist: An unusual presentation of combined psychiatric and neurologic symptoms in a tactical jet aviator</title> <abstract>A 28-yr-old Naval F-14 aviator presented with complaints of flight- related anxiety occurring intermittently over an 18-mo period. Symptoms included sensation of strangeness, concern over the welfare of his radar intercept officer, flushing, nausea, and intense need to immediately land the aircraft. He also described a 6-mo history of episodes wherein he would see 'shooting stars' in the periphery of his vision, accompanied by dizziness and disorientation. These latter attacks were always precipitated by head turning, usually in combination with positive Gz maneuvers, and were relieved by head straightening. The anxiety symptoms were consistent with a form of panic attack, but the neurological symptoms provoked further workup. Magnetic resonance cerebral angiogram demonstrated a dominant right vertebral artery and hypoplastic left vertebral artery. All symptoms resolved once the aviator was removed from flying the aircraft. After a year of follow-up with an aviation psychiatrist, he remained asymptomatic and was reassigned to maritime patrol aircraft. This case illustrates a difficult diagnostic, therapeutic, and disposition challenge. This aviator suffered from a complex interaction of neurologic and psychiatric manifestations having a common inciting stimulus, namely flying the F-14 Tomcat. A promising aviation career was preserved upon removal of that stimulus.</abstract>"

While its use as a nursing research tool and a classroom teaching aid have been discussed, little has been written on the use of the technique for individual reflection for those doing post-registration courses. In this paper, the author discusses her personal reflections following a critical incident and the need for the technique to be refined. The framework for reflection is taken primarily from Boyd and Fales. The model describes the process of creating and clarifying the meaning of an experience for oneself.</abstract>"

As there is evidence that this may require cognitive tasking beyond the information-processing capacity of the human brain, it was decided to try and develop a generic crisis management algorithm analogous to the 'Phase I' immediate response routine used by airline pilots. Such an algorithm, based on the mnemonic 'COVER ABCD, A SWIFT CHECK', was developed and refined over 3 meetings, each attended by 60-100 anaesthetists and aviation psychologists. It was validated against 1301 relevant incidents among the first 2000 incidents reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study. It proved sufficiently robust and safe to recommend its general use as an initial response to any incident or crisis which occurs when a patient is breathing gas from an anaesthetic machine. It requires a limited knowledge base and is easily learnt and rehearsed during the anaesthetist's working day. It will provide a functional diagnosis in over 99% of cases and will correct 62% of the problems in 40-60 seconds. In the remaining 37% it will allow the anaesthetist to proceed with a 'sub-algorithm' confident in the knowledge that some important step has not been missed. In just over 30% of incidents this will be for a problem familiar to all anaesthetists (e.g. laryngospasm, bradycardia); in just over 6% it will be for a less common, more complex, but finite, set of problems (3% cardiac arrest, 1% air embolism, 1% anaphylaxis, 1% for the remaining desaturations); in less than 1% diagnosis and correction will require a more complex checklist (e.g. for malignant hyperthermia, pneumothorax). The next stage, the development of specific sub-algorithms and a structured team approach for ongoing problems, is in progress.</abstract>"

Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic, was evaluated for its residual effects on daytime wakefulness in 12 subjects belonging to ground air force personnel and 12 navy fighter pilots. In this controlled double blind crossover study, each subject randomly received zolpidem 10mg, flunitrazepam 1mg or placebo, in three separate sessions, 1 week apart at 10 p.m. or 1 a.m., respectively. The absence of residual effects after zolpidem intake was attested by subjective assessments, psychomotor tests (including a simulated flight), and EEG analysis showed that this hypnotic could be considered for operational use.</abstract>"

These cases demonstrate the challenges in diagnosis and disposition that face the clinical aeromedical specialist in evaluating the aviator who develops psychiatric symptoms. We discuss the aeromedical factors that must be considered when contemplating returning aviators with psychiatric diagnoses to flying duties. Sudden behavioral changes in aviation personnel require a systematic assessment, thorough documentation, and continuing reevaluation. The differentiation between organic and functional etiologies may be difficult. Final disposition may require consultation with experienced physicians skilled in both aviation psychiatry and neurology.</abstract>"

Critical ratio statistic was used for comparisons involving means and chi square was employed for comparisons involving a number of Ss. Significant differences between psychological problems groups are corresponding normal groups were obtained for 6 of the variables. Among findings: (a) Aviation electronic school contributed a disproportionately large number of students with psychological problems, while aviation engines school contributed a disproportionately small number; (b) academic failures were found to a greater extent in psychological problems groups rather than in normal groups; (c) Marine Corps contributed men to psychological problems groups to a greater degree than Navy; (d) underachievement in a previous service school was associated with membership in psychological problems groups; and (e) number of years of civilian education was less for psychological problems groups than for normal groups. It was concluded that no consistent tendency was found for maladjustment to be more closely related to situational variables or to nonsituational variables.

Reference is here being made most specifically to the reaction-time experiment for one, salvaged by the workers on aviation problems. And new experiments with new techniques were fashioned and new combinations of old techniques were instituted. What experiments were designed and performed to meet the requirements attending the classification of aviators and prospective aviators in Italy, France, England, and this country during the war are admirably and extensively described by Dockeray and Isaacs in this article, the summary being an excellent review of the foreign and domestic literature on the subject. Many and exceedingly interesting results of the experiments, most of them obtained from numerous subjects, are cited, but they are too numerous and too well organized in the writers' summary to enumerate here. Two important results were the following: (1) Practically all of the best pursuit pilots belonged to the sensory reaction-time type, and exhibited a keen perception of the position of the body, low visual reaction-times, low choice reaction-times, and a low average deviation in reaction-time. Resistance to influences of emotional stimuli was not always present or necessary, some of the best pilots being quite susceptible to emotional conditions. (2) Practically all of the best slow machine, bombing, aviators were motors in reaction-time; and Caproni pilots exhibited resistance to emotional stimuli. From Psych Bulletin 18:06:00361.
