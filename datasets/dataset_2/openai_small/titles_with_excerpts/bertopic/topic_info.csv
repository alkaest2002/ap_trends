However, the internal mechanism of how rumination affects psychological resilience, particularly the chain mediating effect of proactive coping and generalized anxiety, has not been thoroughly explored in high-stress populations. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, 1,235 flight students from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China were surveyed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to gather data.</excerpt>', '<title>Social acceptance of increased usage of the ballistic parachute system in a general aviation aircraft</title> <excerpt>Background: An airframe parachute (""Chute"") available in certain aircraft is designed to lower the airplane safely to the ground for emergency situations that occur 500 ft (152 m) above ground level (AGL): the ""Chute altitude envelope.""

The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions. While PPP was poorer in the SART than in the TVF, that result could be accounted for by a loss of motor control rather than a lack of mindfulness.</excerpt>', '<title>Comparison of the vigilance performance of men and women using a simulated radar task</title> <excerpt>The present study examined the question of possible sex differences in the ability to sustain attention to a complex monitoring task requiring only a detection response to critical stimulus changes.

Predictions about motivation-performance relationships were based on intrinsic-extrinsic motivation distinctions. Results indicated that there was a robust relationship between motivation and performance, in that the greater the number of student cancellations during a course of training, the lower the student performance in actual flight training.</excerpt>', ""<title>Personality factors affecting pilot combat performance: A preliminary investigation</title> <excerpt>Reviews of the research literature have generally concluded that personality factors contribute little to pilot performance. One possible explanation for the failure to find stronger relationships may be due to the lack of appropriate taxonomies for both personality constructs and for performance constructs. The present research was designed to examine the relationship between personality and combat performance using the 'Big Five' model of personality and a multi-component model of pilot combat performance.</excerpt>"", ""<title>The Wright brothers: a personality profile.</title> <excerpt>Wilbur and Orville Wright were able, as a team, to develop the first heavier than air machine capable of sustained, controlled, powered flight while piloted by a man. This was due, very possibly, to the presence of a left hemispheric dominant personality in Wilbur Wright and a right hemispheric dominant personality in Orville Wright. They were thus able to complement each other's skills and creativity in such a way as to make this feat possible.</excerpt>""]"

However, a subset of participants reacted negatively to the training and showed boomerangs (negative change) in attitudes. Explorations into the causes of this effect pinpoint personality factors and group dynamics as critical determinants of reactions to training and of the magnitude and direction of attitude change.</excerpt>', ""<title>Developing a Method for Evaluating Crew Resource Management Skills: A European Perspective</title> <excerpt>The European Commission in conjunction with the European Joint Aviation Authorities (Human Factors Project Advisory Group) has been sponsoring a series of studies investigating a culturally robust method for the evaluation of pilots' nontechnical skills (NTS) for multicrew operations.
