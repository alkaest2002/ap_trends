0,2025,BMC Medical Education,Defining competence profiles in obstetrics and gynecology using the modified requirement tracking questionnaire,"BackgroundData about the competencies needed for physicians in obstetrics and gynecology (O&G) is currently insufficient. The aim of this study is to define the competence profile needed in this sector for daily professional activity, in order to account for these criteria in future recruitment.MethodsThe modified requirement-tracking questionnaire (R-track) was sent to 307 physicians working in the field of O&G with different training levels and practice locations. The R-track is designed to assess professional competence profiles and contains 66 items covering the following eight competence areas: “Mental abilities”, “Social sensibility”, “Psychomotor and multitasking abilities”, “Solutions orientation”, “Social interactive competences”, “Personality traits”, “Verbal competences” and “Resistance capacity”. The mean scores of single items and competence areas were calculated. Results were compared between gender, training level, and place of practice.ResultsThe participation rate was 65.5%, with 201 physicians returning the questionnaire. In this sample, 50.2% of them were in training and 49.8% were practicing O&G specialists. The proportion of physicians working in a hospital setting was 64.7% while 30.3% worked in private practice. The competence areas “Social sensibility” and “Psychomotor & multitasking abilities” appear to be the most important for daily professional activity. At the item level, “Stress resistance”, followed by “Workload management” and “Tactfulness” were considered as the most valuable characteristics. Differences between gender, level of training, and place of practice were not significant.ConclusionThe identified competence profile could serve as a basis for developing a new method of O&G residency selection. In addition, such a profile could help medical students to decide on a professional specialization at a very early stage by comparing their personal competence profile with the one in the field or with their mentors.","BackgroundData about the competencies needed for physicians in obstetrics and gynecology (O&G) is currently insufficient.

1,2024,PQDT - Global,The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Fear of Flying and Flying Habits: The Mediating Effect of Anxiety Sensitivity,"Background and goals:Fear of flying (FoF) is a prevalent and highly disabling phobia. Several studies have examined various aspects of the effects of COVID-19 on the aviation industry, including health and safety protocols adopted by airlines, airport authorities, and border control administrations or on travelers’ motivation to fly. Numerous recent studies have explored the effect of COVID-19 on passengers’ traveling habits and motivation to travel, with special emphasis on flying. However, very few studies, if any, examined the effects of COVID-19 on FoF, a prevalent and highly disabling phobia, among people with and without pre-existing FoF. This perspective is important because there is a high probability that the epidemic affected people with and without FoF differently, which may require different solutions for different people.The primary goal of this study was to address this lacuna in the literature by exploring the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on FoF and flying habits among a large representative sample of people from the general population, with and without pre-existing FoF. A secondary goal was to assess the degree to which anxiety sensitivity (AS) mediates this effect. The study hypothesis was that the COVID-19 pandemic would increase the overall prevalence of FoF and AS (measured as continuous variables), this effect was hypothesized to be mediated by AS, and moderating by pre-existing FoF. We also explored the extent to which pre-existing FoF moderated the indirect effect of COVID-19 on FoF via AS.Method:To test the above hypotheses, the study used a two-wave, pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19, retrospective design among a randomly selected sample of 470 participants from the general population in Israel.Results:The findings of the study provided moderate to strong support for most of the hypotheses. The study findings indicated an increased prevalence of FoF from pre-COVID19 to during the pandemic. Findings regarding the overall levels of FoF and AS were mixed, yet findings showed that COVID-19 was related to higher AS. We also found that the underlying mechanism of effects was stronger for participants without pre-existing phobias, including FoF than others.Discussion:These findings' theoretical and clinical perspectives offer new insights into the nature and causes of FoF. From an applied point of view, the findings of this study shed light on the effects of a pandemic in general, and the COVID-19 pandemic in particular.","Background and goals:Fear of flying (FoF) is a prevalent and highly disabling phobia.

2,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Naturalistic Study Examining the Data/Frame Model of Sensemaking by Assessing Experts in Complex, Time-Pressured Aviation Domains","Research on expert chess players, radiologists and landmine detection personnel suggests a use of cognitive frameworks, alternatively referred to as schemas, templates, scripts, frames and models, to effectively perceive, interpret, understand, recall, and anticipate information. These experts may use cognitive frameworks to capture past experience in ways that support rapid pattern recognition, adaptive responses and proactivity. The proposed research approach assumes that experienced pilots will similarly rely on cognitive frameworks to handle information and make sense of complex, fast-moving situations experienced in their information-dense environments. Predictions from Klein et al.'s (2006) Data/Frame Model of Sensemaking were used to evaluate event-based interview data collected from uninhabited aerial system (UAS) pilots and high performance military aircraft pilots (F-16 and UH-60 Black Hawk) in order to assess the methods with which these experts handle large amounts of critical information in their operations. This effort may benefit the sensemaking model, a model based largely on domains in which situations unfold over time and decision-making can be adapted, such as in information operations, nursing and fire fighting, by comparing its predictions with data collected from UAS pilots. The UAS operations domain, in particular, has characteristics that differ from those of domains on which the model is based because UAS pilot sensemaking must support decisions and continuous adjustments of an aircraft operating in a dynamic, potentially complex, and rapidly shifting environment from which the pilot is physically removed. The military aviation domain may be similar to studied domains that some decisions need to be made rapidly, and situations can change rapidly; nevertheless, as a new domain to the model, offers the potential to reveal new insights. Based on this research, recommendations are offered for aviation training and other information-rich domains, and evidence is provided that addresses the question, ""How much information can a person handle?""","Research on expert chess players, radiologists and landmine detection personnel suggests a use of cognitive frameworks, alternatively referred to as schemas, templates, scripts, frames and models, to effectively perceive, interpret, understand, recall, and anticipate information.

3,2025,Journal of Electrical Systems and Information Technology,Intelligent air traffic control using NLP-enhanced speech recognition and natural language generation,"The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) can bring an intelligent solution to air traffic management (ATM) for reliability, accuracy, and safety. This research aims to present a real-time intelligent system that improves the communication between air traffic controllers (ATCOs) and pilots. The proposed system enhances transcription accuracy, supports automated decision-making, reduces the response time and furthermore improves safety in high-air traffic situations. The proposed architecture is designed to enable scalable integration of AI tools and NLP technologies in ATC systems. The merits of the proposed system is that it automates the whole steps of the communication in the air traffic system, rather than implementing parts of the process. The system begins by automatic speech recognition (ASR) module that is responsible for transforming the speech (instructions) into text. The architecture enables understanding the main ATC instructions via a specific list of most common keywords through a natural language understanding module (NLU), thus enabling the pilot to communicate with the ATM system. Additionally, the system incorporates natural language response generation (NLG) module to reduce pilot workload and improve the communication efficiency. Extensive experiments were conducted for system verification on several datasets, where each dataset is targeted for a specific module of the system. Through the results, the proposed system demonstrates its capability of reducing the communication errors and improving service reliability with the overall word recognition accuracy by the ASR module of 91.73%, while the NLU module gives F1 score to 0.9816, and the NLG module produced acceptable quality of generated texts (85%) and with generation latency ~ 0.6 s. Compared to the recent existing systems, our system gives a better overall performance.","The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) can bring an intelligent solution to air traffic management (ATM) for reliability, accuracy, and safety.

This article focuses on identifying factors influencing air passengers’ environmental awareness and resulting behaviour change towards more environmentally friendly air travel behaviour. A conceptual factor model is developed based on a systematic literature review of prevailing research (N = 111) and semi-structured interviews with experts (N = 14) from the aviation industry and beyond in Europe. The model distinguishes between demographic factors, internal factors, such as knowledge and values, and external factors, such as media usage and government policies. Three main parties emerge as forces that drive passengers towards increasing awareness and behaviour change: government, airlines, and social movement groups. The media is found to be a mediator. Focusing on the gap between attitude and behaviour, we summarize the factors that contribute to it and propose strategies to mitigate it.","Assessing the environmental impact of air travel is a complex endeavour with various solution scenarios and stakeholders, including the passengers.

However, the lack of a valid and reliable instrument sensitive to the Ethiopian culture for measuring health professional practice environment leads to difficulty in constructing evaluations of safety climate and further linking organizational research to outcomes research. This research study examined the psychometric properties of the Safety Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) in the Amharic language within an Ethiopian healthcare context.MethodA hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted. The SAQ was meticulously translated into Amharic using forward and backward translation methods. Content validity was evaluated with input from seven patient safety and healthcare quality experts. Face validity was established through feedback from healthcare professionals. Then, the Amharic SAQ (SAQ-A) was distributed to 648 participants working in 11 public hospitals, and a total of 611 valid questionnaires were completed and returned (95.2% response rate). Cronbach’s alpha, McDonald’s omega, composite reliability, correlation analysis, and average variance estimation were calculated, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed. Descriptive analyses were performed to describe socio-demographic characteristics. A P-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Tables, figures, charts, and texts are used for data presentation.ResultThe overall internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for the 31-item SAQ-A was 0.903, indicating excellent reliability. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated a good model fit for each dimension and the entire construct (χ2=1086.675, df=412, p<0.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.923, Tucker Lewis index (TLI)=0.913, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.052). The positive response rate of healthcare workers in hospitals was 32.1%. The positive response rates of the six dimensions were teamwork climate (59.7%), safety climate (41.9%), job satisfaction (57.1%), working conditions (37.5%), perception of management (37.6%), and stress recognition (46.2%).ConclusionThe Amharic translation of the SAQ showed good psychometric properties, making it a valuable tool for assessing safety attitudes among Amharic-speaking Ethiopian healthcare practitioners.","BackgroundIn Ethiopia, there is a growing concern about improving patients’ safety in healthcare facilities.

The purpose of the mixed method convergent parallel design study was to gain information about how well certified airline transport pilots perceive they work with different generations and genders using CRM procedures developed decades ago when more than two generations were not present in the workforce. The population was commercial aviation pilots from different generations and genders including the baby boomers, Generation X, and the millennials flying for approved FAA commercial airlines within the United States. An online survey was used for the quantitative component ( N = 166) and a semi-structured interview for the qualitative component (N = 11). The quantitative component resulted failure to reject all hypotheses, and the qualitative component revealed five overarching themes: CRM processes work in general, personality differences instead of gender differences, perceived generational differences, attitudes, and the need for females to prove themselves. Post hoc reliability analyses revealed low internal consistency of the CMAQ, the instrument for measuring pilot attitudes toward CRM. The findings suggest areas to further explore when evaluating the effectiveness of CRM processes and when evaluating the psychometric characteristics of the commonly used CMAQ.","While information gathered four decades ago indicates crew resource management (CRM) procedures have improved commercial aviation pilots’ abilities to work effectively together, it is unclear if CRM procedures continue to remain effective when commercial aviation pilots frequently work with other individuals from three or more different generations and with an increase in female airline pilots.

7,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Towards a Theory of Mind Wandering in Relation to Task Type, Behavioral Responses, and Respective Adverse Consequences in Piloted Vehicles","In critical systems, human operators are often responsible for maintaining the safe operation of systems. However, cognitive factors (e.g., affect, attentional resources, fatigue, etc.) can negatively affect the operator’s ability to stay focused on the task and make timely decisions. Although prior research has studied multiple factors that impact performance, such as distracted driving, situation awareness, multitasking, vigilance decrements, etc., mind wandering has yet to be integrated with these factors to yield a more comprehensive theory of human performance. To address this problem, we employed a mixed method, qualitative and quantitative, approach to study performance implications of mind wandering in the context of automobile driving and aviation piloting using undergraduate students and certified pilots, respectively.In Part I, we assessed the degree of unrelatedness required between thoughts and the current task at hand before it was subjectively classified as mind wandering with respect to four types of relatedness (e.g., functional, conceptual, temporal relatedness and thought tense). Using a factor scenario survey approach, high and low levels of each type of relatedness were correlated with participant’s perceptions of mind wandering. It was found that thoughts conceptually unrelated to the task were significantly more often identified as mind wanderings; the only main effect of these four types of relatedness. In addition, there were a few significant interactions with functional relatedness and the tense as well as temporal relatedness. Low functional, retrospective thoughts were more likely considered mind wanderings than high functional, prospective thoughts. Also, low functional thoughts in the distant past or distant future were more likely considered mind wanderings (e.g., low temporal relatedness) than high functional thoughts in the near past or future (e.g., high temporal relatedness). In addition to these relatedness types studied in Part I, thoughts were also categorized on a continuum of task/thought decoupling with on-task thoughts at one end of the continuum (e.g., low decoupling) and mind wanderings that lack meta-awareness at the other (e.g., high decoupling) in Part IV of this research effort. Based on discussions with participants during these studies, the continuum of all thought categories is ordered from least to most decoupled as follows: on-task, off-task, mind wandering and unaware mind wandering. In Part III, we explored whether the level of thought/task decoupling was related to performance decrements in the driving simulation environment. When participants were most frequently mind wandering without meta-awareness which is the most extreme decoupled state, the highest mean number of lane deviations (2.26 deviations) and the second highest mean seconds of speeding (5.53 seconds) were recorded. When participants were most frequently on-task, the lowest mean seconds of speeding (1.17 seconds) and second lowest number of mean lane deviations (1.00 deviations) also resulted. A similar relationship was found in the flight simulation with general aviation pilots even though the frequencies of off-task thinking were lower. When all on-task and off-task thought contents were examined, it was found that when pilots believed their thoughts were on-task, thought decoupling occurred as the pilot moved from high task load situations (e.g., take-off and climb) to lower task load situations (e.g., cruise). During take-off and climb, pilots’ thinking involved actions/behaviors previously executed as well as thoughts about navigation. If poor performance occurred in the take-off phase of flight, thoughts about their performance often appeared during the climb phase of flight. During cruise, thinking became more decoupled from the task (e.g., thoughts about planning and strategizing) even though these thoughts were participant classified as on-task. Thus, as the pilots executed tasks from take-off to cruise, the thoughts gradually became more decoupled.Correlates to mind wandering were also assessed to understand when and why mind wandering may occur. Similar to findings in the prior literature, negative mood was found to be significantly and positively related to higher frequencies of off-task thinking but not mind wandering. Yet, task load, subjective mental workload, task type and working memory capacity did not significantly correlate with frequencies of off-task thinking and mind wandering.Lastly, this work investigated the efficacy of three mind wandering metrics used in prior literature (e.g., all probe, self-caught and probe, and clicker). Efficacy was operationally defined as a metric that from the participant’s viewpoint, facilitated quick task re-engagement, accurately captured the frequency of mind wanderings and did not unnaturally engender excessive meta-awareness. The results suggest that the clicker method was the most efficacious metric followed by the self-caught/probe and the all probe metrics.This mixed method approach sought to build theory about what mind wandering is, when it arises and for what reasons. A framework is needed to understand how the results reported herein overlap with other theory generated about these related phenomena.

Prior research has explored the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and work engagement in various industries, but studies focusing on pilots, particularly in the business aviation industry (BAI) are lacking. This quantitative correlational-predictive study examined the extent to which EI predicts work engagement among BAI pilots in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas and whether this relationship is moderated by age, years of formal education, and years of service. The theoretical framework, grounded in literature, associates EI with enhanced work engagement and improved organizational citizenship. The study employed validated instruments to measure EI and work engagement, using moderation analysis to examine the hypotheses. Results indicate that EI significantly predicts work engagement. Age does not moderate the relationship between EI and work engagement; however, the association is moderated for years of education below 6.59 and years of service lesser than 25.48. In conclusion, the study provides valuable theoretical and practical implications, along with recommendations for future research.","The aviation industry is facing a severe pilot shortage, intensified by the Great Resignation and post-pandemic employment challenges, making the study of work engagement critical.

The purpose of this exploratory sequential mixed methods study was to determine if Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) students who enroll and eventually graduate in the Aerospace Professional Pilot concentration and students who enroll in the Aerospace Professional Pilot concentration but subsequently switch to another Aerospace concentration differ in the noncognitive traits of grit and growth mindset. Grit is defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals (Duckworth, 2016), and growth mindset is defined as the belief that intelligence is not fixed and can be improved with effort and time. If students who are high in grit and growth mindset are more likely to complete training, identifying students who are high in these noncognitive traits and providing courses to enhance these traits may help alleviate the current pilot shortage. In the first quantitative phase of this mixed methods study, Angela Duckworth’s Grit-S Scale was used to measure grit (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009), and Carol Dweck’s mindset survey was used to measure growth mindset (Dweck, 2016) in MTSU Aerospace students who initially enrolled in the Professional Pilot concentration. Descriptive and inferential statistics were generated to see if there was a difference in grit and growth mindset between students who enrolled and persisted in the MTSU Aerospace Professional Pilot concentration and those who subsequently switched. Then a purposeful sample of four volunteers from each group was randomly selected to participate in the second qualitative phase of this mixed methods study to explain and clarify the results of the first phase quantitative results. Open ended questions were asked to determine if there is a difference in the educational experiences between the two groups of students. The first phase quantitative results found a significant difference in grit but no significant difference in growth mindset between the two groups. Answers to the open-ended questions in the qualitative second phase demonstrated that the group who enrolled and stayed in the Professional Pilot concentration were more self-motivated than students who enrolled in the Professional Pilot concentration but subsequently switched to another Aerospace concentration.","Due to a shortage of qualified commercial pilots and the high attrition rate of collegiate professional pilot students, increasing the number of students who successfully complete training is critical for the future success of the commercial aviation industry.

11,2025,"European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education",The Moderating Role of Resilience in the Relationship Between Occupational Stressors and Psychological Distress Among Aviation Pilots in Pakistan,"Background: Aviation is one of the most demanding professions, exposing pilots to persistent stressors such as fatigue, irregular schedules, and high safety responsibility. These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots. Method: A sample of 200 pilots completed validated self-report measures: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using bivariate correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and mediation/moderation analyses via the PROCESS macro. Results: Resilience was negatively correlated with total DAS scores (r = −0.46, p< 0.001), while fatigue (r = 0.42, p< 0.001) and avoidance coping (r = 0.38, p< 0.001) were positively correlated. The regression model accounted for 46% of the variance in DAS (R2 = 0.46). Task-focused coping predicted lower stress levels, whereas avoidance coping predicted higher anxiety and depression. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and depression, buffering the impact of stress on mood outcomes. Mediation analyses indicated that coping styles partially explained the protective effect of resilience. ANOVA results confirmed that pilots with high resilience reported significantly lower depression scores than those with medium or low resilience, F(2, 197) = 6.72, p< 0.01. Conclusions: Resilience emerged as both a direct and indirect buffer against psychological strain in aviation. These findings underscore the importance of promoting adaptive coping and resilience training, alongside effective fatigue management, to enhance pilot well-being and maintain safety in aviation systems.","Background: Aviation is one of the most demanding professions, exposing pilots to persistent stressors such as fatigue, irregular schedules, and high safety responsibility. These conditions heighten vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS), yet the protective mechanisms mitigating such effects remain less well understood. Objective: This study examined the roles of resilience, coping strategies, and fatigue in predicting DAS among commercial airline pilots.","<title>The Moderating Role of Resilience in the Relationship Between Occupational Stressors and Psychological Distress Among Aviation Pilots in Pakistan</title> <excerpt>Background: Aviation is one of the most demanding professions, exposing pilots to persistent stressors such as fatigue, irregular schedules, and high safety responsibility.

12,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Effect of motivation on superlative responding among aviation and psychology students on the MMPI-2,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether highly motivating instructional conditions on MMPI-2 had a differential effect on the resulting MMPI-2 profiles of undergraduate aviation and psychology majors, particularly on the validity, clinical, and content scales. Of particular interest was the effect that instructional condition had on Superlative Self-Presentation  (S) scale scores among aviation majors. One hundred and thirty-two upper-level undergraduate psychology and aviation majors at the University of North Dakota were randomly assigned to complete the MMPI-2 under one of two instructional conditions, ""High Motivation"" (HM) or ""Standard Instructions"" (SI). Results of the study showed that HM instructions resulted in increased standard scores on validity scales measuring under-reporting for all groups, but did not result in increases on any of the clinical or content scales for any group. Aviation majors demonstrated no differential effect of instructional condition on any clinical or content scales, whereas the effect among psychology majors was more pronounced. Additional effects of instructional condition on validity, clinical, and content scales are discussed, as are this study's implications and limitations.","The purpose of this study was to determine whether highly motivating instructional conditions on MMPI-2 had a differential effect on the resulting MMPI-2 profiles of undergraduate aviation and psychology majors, particularly on the validity, clinical, and content scales.

13,2024,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),Exploring the measurement of psychological resilience in Chinese civil aviation pilots based on generalizability theory and item response theory,"Understanding and accurately measuring resilience among Chinese civil aviation pilots is imperative, especially concerning the psychological impact of distressing events on their well-being and aviation safety. Despite the necessity, a validated and tailored measurement tool specific to this demographic is absent. Addressing this gap, this study built on the widely used CD-RISC-25 to analyze and modify its applicability to Chinese civil aviation pilots. Utilizing CD-RISC-25 survey data from 231 Chinese pilots, correlational and differential analyses identified items 3 and 20 as incongruent with this population's resilience profile. Subsequently, factor analysis derived a distinct two-factor resilience psychological framework labeled “Decisiveness” and “Adaptability”, which diverged from the structure found in American female pilots and the broader Chinese populace. Additionally, to further accurately identify the measurement characteristics of this 2-factor measurement model, this study introduced Generalized Theory and Item Response Theory, two modern measurement analysis theories, to comprehensively analyze the overall reliability of the measurement and issues with individual items. Results showed that the 2-factor model exhibited high reliability, with generalizability coefficient reaching 0.89503 and dependability coefficient reaching 0.88496, indicating the 2-factor measurement questionnaire can be effectively utilized for relative and absolute comparison of Chinese civil aviation pilot resilience. However, items in Factor 2 provided less information and have larger room for optimization than those in Factor 1, implying item option redesign may be beneficial. Consequently, this study culminates in the creation of a more accurate and reliable two-factor psychological resilience measurement tool tailored for Chinese civil aviation pilots, while exploring directions for optimization. By facilitating early identification of individuals with lower resilience and enabling the evaluation of intervention efficacy, this tool aims to positively impact pilot psychological health and aviation safety in the context of grief and trauma following distressing events.","Understanding and accurately measuring resilience among Chinese civil aviation pilots is imperative, especially concerning the psychological impact of distressing events on their well-being and aviation safety.

14,2024,PQDT - Global,The Effects of Interruptions on Performance in a Procedural Task with Sequential Constraints,"In recent years, a growing body of research has revealed negative effects of interruptions on performance in an interrupted (primary) task. However, considerably fewer studies have investigated the effects of interruptions in memory-based procedural tasks with sequential constraints. Focusing on the performance in this type of primary task, this thesis investigates the effects of interruption length, the complexity of the interruption task, and the similarity between the primary task and the interruption task. Moreover, the potential of mnemonic acronyms to improve learning, execution, and, critically, resilience toward interruptions has also been addressed. Despite having been widely used to support the learning and execution of procedural tasks, mnemonic acronyms have not been systematically investigated for their effects on performance thus far.The results of Study A revealed that mnemonic acronyms can speed up learning of the primary task and improve resilience toward interruptions at certain positions in the procedural task. Moreover, the standard effects of interruption length were replicated. That is, we found that more time is needed to resume the primary task after a long interruption compared to a short one. Also, it is more likely that an error will be committed after a long interruption. In Study B, the results confirmed that more time is needed to resume the primary task and more errors emerge after a complex interruption task than after a simple one. At the same time, variations in similarity in terms of processing codes between the verbal primary task and the interruption tasks do not seem to play a role in resumption costs. This study also provides preliminary evidence that similarity in terms of sequential demand between the two tasks might play a role in resumption costs in a primary procedural task with sequential constraints.The results obtained are discussed in the context of the two main theories in the domain of interruption research: the Memory for Goals Theory (Altmann & Trafton, 2002) and the Prospective Memory Theory (e.g., Einstein et al., 2003). Besides, the results are also discussed in the context of other, complementary theories. Finally, implications of the results in the domains of cognitive psychology and applied psychology are also considered.","In recent years, a growing body of research has revealed negative effects of interruptions on performance in an interrupted (primary) task.

16,2025,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),A deep learning approach for improving spatiotemporal resolution of numerical weather prediction forecasts,"This study addresses the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models in wind forecasting for aviation operations by introducing a deep learning approach based on a spatiotemporal fusion model that enhances the temporal resolution and accuracy of wind forecasts. Specifically, the model integrates Global Forecast System (GFS) with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data, employing a 1-dimensional convolutional layer for spatial data fusion and a bidirectional long short-term memory network for spatiotemporal pattern recognition. The presented approach considerably improves upon the numeric model, increasing temporal resolution from 3-hour to 1-hour intervals and reducing mean absolute error by over 50% for wind speed and direction forecasts. The proposed model achieves 82.85% accuracy in wind direction predictions within a 20° angle, compared to 64.46% for the GFS model forecasts. Case studies demonstrate the proposed model’s superior performance in capturing wind variability, particularly in complex topographical settings like Madeira International Airport. These improvements have relevant implications for aviation safety, flight planning, and fuel consumption optimization. The geographic independence of the proposed approach suggests potential applicability across diverse regions.","This study addresses the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models in wind forecasting for aviation operations by introducing a deep learning approach based on a spatiotemporal fusion model that enhances the temporal resolution and accuracy of wind forecasts.

17,2025,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Rethinking Pilot Retention in the United States: An Analysis of Key Factors,"This thesis examined pilot retention challenges in U.S. regional and low-cost carriers (LCCs), focusing on nonfinancial incentives such as quality of life, career stability, and work-life balance, which may have a greater influence on retention than traditional financial incentives. This quantitative, survey-based approach assesses how pilots rank the factors that influence their retention. Using a sample of U.S.-based pilots, the study examines six key areas adapted from a European pilot retention framework. Statistical analyses, including the Friedman test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test, identified correlations between demographic variables and retention priorities.The inherent financial constraints of regional airline business models often mean that offered salaries cannot compete with the compensation packages provided by mainline carriers. However, the findings suggest that nonfinancial quality of life factors, such as desirable pilot bases, work-life balance, and predictable schedules, may counterbalance the financial incentives offered by mainline carriers, especially for the younger generation of pilots entering the workforce. Addressing the methodological limitations identified within the study and conducting comprehensive mixed-methods research in the future, will further clarify pilot retention dynamics, offering practical guidance to airline management, policymakers, and labor organizations.","This thesis examined pilot retention challenges in U.S. regional and low-cost carriers (LCCs), focusing on nonfinancial incentives such as quality of life, career stability, and work-life balance, which may have a greater influence on retention than traditional financial incentives.

18,2024,BMC Medical Education,A systematic review of medical practitioners’ retention and application of basic sciences to clinical practice,"BackgroundMedical education offers the foundational base for future healthcare professionals, with basic sciences playing a pivotal role in providing essential knowledge and skills for clinical practice. However, the long-term retention and application of this knowledge in clinical practice remain a significant challenge. This systematic review synthesised global evidence from diverse studies on the short / long-term retention and clinical application of basic sciences among medical doctors.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted across six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, Emcare, and Informit. The review included studies that encompassed a variety of study designs, participant groups, and educational interventions. The Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was utilised to assess the quality of the reviewed studies.ResultsA total of 10 studies were included in the review. The findings revealed that rehearsals significantly optimise the retention of basic science knowledge among medical practitioners. Retention varied by discipline, with medical practitioners retaining more knowledge in anatomy (mean scores ranging from 45.0 to 82.9%), while microbiology had the lowest retention score (39.1%). Factors influencing retention included age, gender, and curriculum type. Educational interventions such as targeted courses, integration of basic sciences with clinical skills, generative retrieval and continuous quality improvement in the curriculum were found to enhance both knowledge retention and clinical reasoning. The concept of ‘encapsulated knowledge’ demonstrates that integrated basic science knowledge helps in synthesising clinical presentations, reducing the need for detailed recall as clinical experience increases. The reviewed studies primarily involved interns and surgeons, leaving a significant gap in research for specialties like internal medicine and primary care/ general practice.ConclusionDetailed retention of basic science knowledge may diminish over time; however, the conceptual framework remains essential for ongoing learning and clinical reasoning. This review’s findings highlight the need for specialised educational interventions to improve long-term retention. Continuous professional development and targeted educational techniques are vital for maintaining clinical competence and applying basic science knowledge effectively throughout a medical career. Further research is needed to address gaps in specialty-specific knowledge application and the impact of different instructional methods.","BackgroundMedical education offers the foundational base for future healthcare professionals, with basic sciences playing a pivotal role in providing essential knowledge and skills for clinical practice.

20,2025,BMC Medical Education,Developing a learning tool for advanced life support and resuscitation: Performance Reflection Model for Resuscitation (PRM-Resus),"BackgroundAcquiring proficiency in advanced life support (ALS) can pose challenges for novice learners. Simulation-based training (SBT) is widely used to address this, offering learners opportunities to practise and receive feedback during debriefing. However, existing performance tools often lack the clarity, behavioural specificity, and educational scaffolding required to support deep reflective learning. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the Performance Reflection Model for Resuscitation (PRM-Resus) and to integrate it with the ALS Team Model and structured video exemplars as a comprehensive learning package to enhance ALS training.MethodsThe study involved four phases. Phase 1 created the ALS Team Model to clarify individual roles. Phase 2 focused on co-designing PRM-Resus, using team expertise and the Team Model to create behaviourally anchored performance descriptors. In Phase 3, video scenarios were produced to represent ALS team performance at varying proficiency levels. Phase 4 evaluated the PRM-Resus through expert think-aloud studies. Qualitative content analysis was used alongside Cronbach’s alpha to assess internal consistency and its use for SBT.ResultsThe PRM-Resus comprises four domains—clinical skills, clinical knowledge, team management, and leadership—each defined by behavioural descriptors across three performance levels. The participating experts endorsed the tool’s clarity, structure, and educational value for novice learners. Internal consistency was high (α > 0.95). When used alongside the ALS Team Model and video exemplars, PRM-Resus facilitated deeper performance analysis, which had potential for enhancing post-simulation reflection and supporting faculty development.ConclusionsThis study presents a novel, interdisciplinary framework that integrates PRM-Resus, the ALS Team Model, and video exemplars to support reflective learning in ALS simulation. Together, these tools help novice learners build a concrete understanding of effective team performance and enable educators to deliver more structured feedback. Further research should explore its impact on learner development and potential translation into improved clinical outcomes.","BackgroundAcquiring proficiency in advanced life support (ALS) can pose challenges for novice learners.

With the strides taken in this development, the idea of self-flying aircraft was subsequently derived and pursued. Despite the futuristic excitement behind autonomous airliners, the likelihood of its successful implementation is low. This claim comes from practical research into the plausibility of the technology and is heavily dependent on the idea that human beings find irreplaceable value in knowing that there is human life in manual control of the aircraft. Through different levels of autonomy, there are respectively different levels of acceptance and understanding within society. The history of aviation does contain the implementation and development of autopilot systems and other systems that allow for minimal to no manual control. However, there is an eventual limit to what can plausibly be implemented and developed. Unfortunately for the eager airlines and their investors, the dead end lies in the hands of the passengers and not the technology. Autonomous airliners are at least a few years out, and its implementation will not reach the point of pilotless aircraft.","The topic of artificial intelligence is gaining traction rapidly in today’s society.

25,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Quantifying Occupational Stress Levels in Professional Pilots,"Professional pilots had higher average fatality rates per 100,000 workers than many other occupations in 2008, but there was a gap in the literature regarding potential causes. Also, the effects of age, license type, flight hours, and anxiety as predictors of occupational stress, a possible contributing factor to the high fatality rates, had not been quantified. Personenvironment fit theory formed the theoretical foundation for the study. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors expected from the literature to explain variance in occupational stress in professional pilots. A cross-sectional survey of professional pilots licensed in the United States was conducted (N = 55). Occupational stress was assessed using the Job Stress Survey. Anxiety level was assessed using the Multidimensional Anxiety Questionnaire. Pilot age, license type, and aeronautical experience were also included as predictor variables. Multiple regression analysis revealed that only age had a statistical relationship to occupational stress levels (controlling for all other variables) in commercial and airline transport pilots; older pilots reported less stress. In prior research, higher stress was associated with increased workplace mishaps and health problems. Now that age, more specifically younger pilots, has been associated with higher stress, intervention training can be conducted with pilots. The implications for positive social change include a better understanding of the factors that influence stress among pilots that result in higher levels of job satisfaction and decreased mortality from stress-related factors.","Professional pilots had higher average fatality rates per 100,000 workers than many other occupations in 2008, but there was a gap in the literature regarding potential causes.

The Collegiate Aviation Program Safety Culture Assessment Survey (CAPSCAS) was used. Participants were drawn from flight students and instructors in the program. The survey captured the perceptions of participants on the status of the safety culture in the program. The participants had a good perception of the safety culture in the program. There were significant variances in the perception of respondents on the safety culture by year groups and it was observed that respondents, who had spent more years in the program, had a better perception, on the safety culture. There were also significant differences in the perceptions of US resident students and international contract students, with the latter having a less favorable perception of the safety culture in the program. The results show that differences in national culture can have an effect on perceptions on safety culture. Risky personal attitudes and safety behaviors were predicted from perceptions.

27,2024,BMC Medical Education,Developing emotional preparedness and mental resilience through high-fidelity simulation: a ‘bridge too far’ for institutions teaching major trauma management and mass-casualty medicine?,"BackgroundClinical acumen represents only part of being adequately equipped to attend a major incident. The emotive sights, sounds and smells of these dynamic environments are all-encompassing experiences, and responders must also be armed with the emotional preparedness to perform their clinical or managerial duties effectively, as well as the mental resilience to facilitate professional continuance. Despite this, limited training and a sparsity of evidence exists to guide developments within this domain. Historically, major incident training has focused on clinical theory acquisition, but irrespective of how comprehensive the learning materials, they are of little consequence if tandem steps to cultivate mental resilience and emotional preparedness are absent. High-Fidelity Simulation (HFS) has a growing reputation as an effective means of bridging important gaps between theory and practice. This pilot study aimed to measure student’s self-reported perception of their readiness to respond to a major incident following a large-scale HFS.MethodsQuantitative data was obtained from a sample of 108 students undertaking paramedic science, physician associate studies and adult nursing degree programmes. A bespoke questionnaire was developed to measure self-reported clinical acumen, mental and emotional preparedness.Results91% of students agreed the combination of theoretical training and HFS provided made them feel clinically prepared to attend a real major incident; 86% agreed this experience had developed their mental resilience and 90% agreed that they felt emotionally prepared to attend a major incident.ConclusionWithin this pilot study, the blend of theoretical training and HFS contributed to self-reported clinical acumen, mental and emotional preparation, in learners training to work in disaster environments or emergency medicine settings.","BackgroundClinical acumen represents only part of being adequately equipped to attend a major incident.

Knowing which gaze patterns promote situational awareness can significantly improve nurse instruction.DesignA comparative observational study investigated the role of visual attention on the performance quality, psychophysiological parameters (vital signs, anxiety and stress) and socioemotional competencies (cognitive workload, motivation and self-efficacy) of nursing students with various experience levels.MethodsThirty nursing students divided into two groups according to their academic level: first cycle (n=14) and second-cycle (n=16) faced a clinical simulation scenario to resolve a cardiorespiratory arrest event. Eye tracking-based analysis required the selection of six areas of interest. The monitorization of vital signs included measuring blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation before and after the simulation practice. Participants completed the socioemotional questionnaire (NASA-TLX). They answered the state subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of stress, the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) and the Baessler and Schwarzer General Self-Efficacy Scale.ResultsThe first-cycle group displayed higher vital sign scores than the second cycle, apart from the post-simulation respiratory rate. All physiological parameters increased in mean value after the clinical simulation, except oxygen saturation. Anxiety was the only parameter in the socioemotional domain to present a statistically significant difference between the groups. First-year nursing students showed greater anxiety, stress, mental workload, identified regulation and intrinsic motivation, while second-year students showed higher levels of amotivation, external regulation and perceived self-efficacy. Eye-tracking data (revisits, gaze and duration of fixations) exhibited statistically significant differences depending on the area of interest in both groups (p =. 05). The performance outcomes showed a negative and moderate association with gaze the total number of gazes in the second-cycle group (rho = −0.640, p = 0.010).ConclusionEye-tracking-based analysis can help to predict performance quality while maintaining situational awareness during nursing instruction.","AimTo examine the components of visual attention that maintain situational awareness during simulation training in undergraduate nursing students with different instruction levels.BackgroundEye-tracking can provide deep insight into the nurses' attention during simulated practice.

Data association is the process of assigning currently-sensed landmark features to features that were previously observed or mapped. Most association methods use a nearest-neighbor criterion based on the normalized innovation squared (NIS). In contrast, we derive a new, closed-form, compact association criterion based on projections of the extended Kalman filter’s innovation vector. These innovation projections (IP) capture the impact of wrong associations on both the magnitude and direction of the innovation vector. We evaluate our newly derived IP method using simulated and experimental data for inertial-aided LiDAR localization in both indoor and outdoor environments. Compared to NIS, the proposed IP method (a) reduces the risk of wrong associations and (b) tightens the bound on predicted integrity risk.",This paper presents a new data association method for bounding the integrity risk in landmark-based localization in ground transportation applications.

33,2025,Sustainability,Resilience and Grit for Sustainable Well-Being at Work: Evidence from High-Pressure Service Organizations,"This study investigates how resilience and multidimensional happiness at work (HAW), comprising work engagement, job satisfaction, and affective organizational commitment, contribute to grit among employees in high-pressure service environments. Drawing on Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory, we test a model using data collected in 2024 from 293 employees at an international airport in Cyprus. Structural equation modeling reveals that resilience significantly enhances both grit and all three HAW dimensions. Among them, affective commitment emerged as a key mediator linking resilience to grit, while job satisfaction showed a surprising negative effect on grit. These findings highlight the importance of fostering eudaimonic rather than purely hedonic well-being to build sustainable motivation in emotionally demanding roles. Our results contribute to the sustainable work and well-being literature by positioning resilience and commitment as psychological resources that support organizational adaptability and long-term employee performance. This study offers actionable insights for leadership, HR strategy, and the promotion of sustainable workplace cultures, particularly in aviation and airport operations, where employee well-being directly impacts safety, service quality, and crisis readiness.","This study investigates how resilience and multidimensional happiness at work (HAW), comprising work engagement, job satisfaction, and affective organizational commitment, contribute to grit among employees in high-pressure service environments.

35,2024,PQDT - Global,How Surprise Affects Cognitive Performance and What Effect a Common Stressor Such As Broadband Noise Has on This Performance?,"An event that deviates from what is expected can result in a surprise. Surprises are cognitively taxing as a result of the individual trying to make sense of the unexpected event. In safety critical industries such as aviation, failure to manage a surprise event in a timely manner can adversely affect safety. Noise is also cognitively taxing and if left unmanaged can also adversely affect safety. However, little is known about the effect of a surprise event and a second stressor such as noise on performance. Hence, the aim of the present research was to examine the effect of surprise on decision-making/ cognitive performance and what effect a common stressor such as broadband noise has on this performance. Sixty-three participants completed a Surprised Induced Decision-Making task, half conducted the task in the presence of 75 dBA broadband noise. Reaction time and recall of words presented on an unexpected memory exercise featured as the dependent variables. It was found the surprise event adversely affected reaction time, and this effect was compounded in the presence of broadband noise. Recall performance was poor, irrespective of the two experimental conditions. These results highlight how two common stressors such as surprise and noise can adversely affect individuals’ timely reaction.","An event that deviates from what is expected can result in a surprise.

A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of XR technologies for this purpose and better understand the motivating factors for this use. The systematic review followed the QUOROM framework (adapted for educational studies), screening 1237 candidate articles to 67 eligible for thematic analysis, with 5 of these also meeting meta-analysis criteria. Existing literature emphasizes the benefits of these technologies, particularly as a result of immersiveness and spatial awareness, enabling the application of more modern educational theories. Although the existing literature is concerned with much of the industry, there is a specific focus on general aviation and the more ab initio skills of flight. The results of the meta-analysis indicate improvements in pilot performance, with an overall meta-analytic effect size estimate of 0.884 (z = 2.248, P = 0.025), which is positive, statistically significant, and moderately strong. The findings of this review indicate support for the use and intention for the use of XR in pilot flight training simulators. However, multiple serious research gaps exist, such as the potential higher occurrence of simulator sickness and cybersickness, and a lack of robust research trials that examine transfer of training across the full pilot skill set and curricular contexts.

Twelve subjects, working a 12-hour rotating shift of typically five workdays, were required to take the APTS battery tests three times during a typical shift for the length of the study, which was two months. The findings suggested that cumulative fatigue was building up during the workweek rendering subjects most fatigued at the end of the last day of the shift. Performance at the end of the first night was significantly higher than the performance at the end of last night of the workweek. However, subjects were performing significantly better on the tests at the beginning of the last night shift than at the beginning of the first day shift in the workweek.

Currently, there is no standardized lighting system to enhance the visibility of sUAS during operations, despite reports of their limited visibility. In response to this issue, my study has identified the characteristics of a system that can enhance the detection and visibility of a sUAS to operators, such as drone pilots and especially Visual Observers (VO). My study has three objectives to achieve this goal: First, conduct a conceptual study to investigate whether specific lighting systems can improve operators' ability to detect and react when searching for a sUAS during operations. Second, I employed a virtual reality (VR) headset system with an eyetracking system to document the participants' responses to the lighting systems. Finally, showcase the effectiveness of Virtual Reality headsets in this kind of research, which could potentially lower logistical expenses and boost the number of participants. My study found that placing LED lights around the perimeter of the sUAS improves detection and reaction times. Additionally, using half-flashing and half-non-flashing lights also improves detection and reaction times. Furthermore, I gathered data from 50 participants using a virtual reality headset, a significant increase in sample size compared to previous studies in the literature. In conclusion, this thesis provides recommendations for future researchers and aims to enhance the safety and effectiveness of sUAS operations through improved visibility systems.","Recent reports from the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) and other studies have sparked interest in researching detection systems, such as small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (sUAS) lighting systems.

41,2024,Cureus,Occupational Health Challenges for Aviation Workers Amid the Changing Climate: A Narrative Review,"Although there are many forecasts regarding the impact of climate change on the aviation sector, a critical but frequently neglected dimension is the occupational safety risks faced by aviation professionals. This narrative review explores the potential impacts of the changing climate on the health and safety of aviation personnel. Furthermore, we examine the significance of resilience in helping these workers adapt and effectively manage climate-related challenges in their professional lives. Climate change poses increasing threats to the well-being of flight personnel through elevated temperatures, heightened ultraviolet radiation exposure, increased mental workload from extreme weather events, and other psychological stressors. Building resilience through workforce training, planning, and adaptation can reduce vulnerability. In future research, the iterative process of selecting measurement components to gauge the impact of climate change should balance feasibility, relevance for stakeholders, and accurately capturing exposure effects. For instance, while salivary cortisol measures stress biologically, assessments of depression or burnout may provide more nuanced insights on pilot health for industry decision-makers managing climate impacts. In conclusion, a strategic emphasis on enhancing the physical and psychological well-being of the aviation workforce is imperative for facilitating a more efficient adaptation within the sector. This is of paramount importance, considering the critical function that aviation serves in fostering human connectivity.

42,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Exploring the Decision Making Theory of the General Public Towards Unmanned Commercial Aviation,"Few studies in aviation have explored the values and attitudes towards the future concept of unmanned commercial passenger aircraft. The primary question that was addressed in this study is whether the general public would board a commercial aircraft with the knowledge that the aircraft is unmanned. In order to research this question, the researcher explored the age, gender, and educational differences of the general public as to their values, attitudes, and beliefs towards this topic of humans flying on unmanned commercial aircraft. A fixed research design by means of quantitative correlational research method of a specific population of randomly selected participants of the general public was used to analyze the research questions. From a determined population size of 100, the researcher conducted a power analysis to determine a sample size of 60. From the analysis conducted, it would appear that females felt a little less educated regarding the concept of unmanned commercial aviation and this may be due to a lack of interest in the technological fields. Additionally, participants with less than a bachelor’s degree also felt a little less educated about unmanned aviation. Overall, it would appear that the general public feel well educated regarding the concept of unmanned commercial aviation with no significant difference (smallest p = .285) indicating that the three educational groups did not significantly differ on their average agreement or disagreement on any of the aviation questions. This study concludes that there was no significant difference between different age groups, gender, or educational levels. However, there is still room for more education to be provided in the schools and colleges, as well as from the airlines and manufacturers regarding the safety of the technology used on modern day aircraft. If airline customers expect to attract future unmanned flyers, they must begin to familiarize the general public with the concept within the next couple of years so as to avoid commercial impact due to empty seats on the proposed concept.","Few studies in aviation have explored the values and attitudes towards the future concept of unmanned commercial passenger aircraft.

43,1994,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Human use of automation,"Although operator decisions regarding whether or not to rely on automation can be critical steps in the chain of events that lead to system success or failure, very little is known about how operators make them and what factors influence them. A theory of factors that may influence automation use is given, and four experiments are performed to test the effects of the proposed factors. Factors tested include workload, task uncertainty, automation reliability, operator trust in automation, operator self confidence, operator uncertainty about system state, and risk. The results of the first experiment demonstrate that workload does not influence automation use decisions in this context, but task uncertainty and automation reliability do. The results of the second experiment support those of the first and demonstrate, in addition, that both trust in automation and uncertainty about the automation's current state affect reliance decisions, that violation of trust by an automated system does not lead to lower reliance, and that global attitudes toward automation may affect the initial use of automation but are quickly replaced as an influence by factors that are specific to the system being used. The results of the third experiment indicate that professional airline pilots, who have extensive experience with advanced automation, rely more on automation than nonpilot student subjects, even to the point of not intervening when the automation fails. The results of the fourth experiment indicate that automation use is affected by the consequences of errors, and that airline pilots use automation less following failures when the possible consequences of errors are higher. In addition, large individual difference in automation use decisions were found. These results provide support for a large number of the influences hypothesized initially, but indicate that these influences may operate across a group rather than on individuals. Instead, individuals appear to adopt simple strategies that are influenced by a small number of the possible factors. This suggests that automation use decisions by operators in real systems may be made more rational and more systematic through training or the adoption of appropriate procedures.","Although operator decisions regarding whether or not to rely on automation can be critical steps in the chain of events that lead to system success or failure, very little is known about how operators make them and what factors influence them.

44,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A quantitative investigation into perceived social status and impact on retention phenomenon within the aviation maintenance profession among student and regular members,"One of the factors that contribute to the decline of students entering aviation maintenance has been the perception of the profession. A number of measures to convert the perception of aviation maintenance from a trade to a profession elevating the social status or perceived social status of those active in aviation maintenance have been attempted. Although elevating the social status of the profession is an admirable endeavor, it also may be providing a disservice to the student by painting an unrealistic view of the future and a possible precursor to job dissatisfaction. Disappointment ensues when expectations do not match actuality. The purpose of this analysis is twofold, one purpose is to contrast and compare the social status perceptions of aviation maintenance students to the social status of those currently working in the profession and secondly to analyze the correlation between the social status of the current aviation maintenance workforce and their job satisfaction levels. A sample of two professional aviation maintenance organizations, with memberships comprising regular working members and student members, was made using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire to measure social status, job satisfaction and other contributing factors. This research did not reveal that the social status of the students was inflated stemming from the industry painting an unrealistic image of the profession and therefore supports previous studies that individuals come into the aviation maintenance studies with a preconception of the profession. This also dispels the notion that disappointment follows later when the student enters the professional ranks and the perceived social status level does not materialize leading to job dissatisfaction even though, this study did reveal a very strong correlation between social status and job satisfaction.","One of the factors that contribute to the decline of students entering aviation maintenance has been the perception of the profession.

45,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,An investigation of task and interpersonal processes supporting women remaining in general aviation flight training,"Flight training activity in the General Aviation (GA) industry has been in decline for over 20 years with little indication of a turnaround. Flight schools and GA industry groups have identified a need to increase student and training retention as important to improving the health of the GA industry. The GA industry has identified women as a group to market to for increasing flight student and licensed pilots. Women aviators have been historically under-represented in military, commercial, and general aviation over the past century. Although women make up about 50% of the general adult population, they represent only 12% of flight students, and only 6% of those with a private pilot certificate. Women's interest in learning to fly remains strong and represents a potential untapped market for the General Aviation industry. Psychology may be able to make a contribution toward understanding why women are under-represented and how they might be attracted and retained in General Aviation training. This study explores how females experience flight training in the initial phase of General Aviation flight training, and whether their experience provides clues to women's under-representation in aviation generally. The study investigates how, over three successive time periods, instructor and female student experience their relationship, both in the task and interpersonal dimensions of training. Findings from this study will elucidate the distinctive ways in which female students make sense of their flight training experience and how GA training can be made more available to women. Results of this study may be relevant for understanding, as well as re-mediating, the presently existing gap between male and female individuals regarding their interest in General Aviation flight training.",Flight training activity in the General Aviation (GA) industry has been in decline for over 20 years with little indication of a turnaround.

46,2025,Journal of King Saud University. Computer and Information Sciences,Considering traffic dynamics recurrence and spatiotemporal interaction for air traffic flow prediction,"Accurate Air Traffic Flow Prediction (ATFP) is critical for enhancing airspace safety and efficiency. Achieving high-precision ATFP requires simultaneous consideration of traffic dynamics recurrence and spatiotemporal interaction. However, modeling both dimensions concurrently is challenging, as it demands that the model account for multiple latent factors. To address this, a novel deep learning-based model is proposed that simultaneously accounts for these two dimensions. First, key features with spatial representation value are distilled from the dual perspectives of causal influence and temporal correlation. Second, a sparse slope attention mechanism is designed to capture similar dynamic patterns in historical traffic flows. Finally, multi-scale temporal features are extracted from traffic flows, and a nonlinear activation function is employed to generate dynamic calibration factors, thereby reducing prediction biases across different date distributions. Experimental results on real-world air traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only achieves superior performance in the ATFP task but also validates the effectiveness of each technical module in enhancing overall predictive accuracy. We believe the proposed model can serve as a valuable tool for airspace management, providing reliable decision support for air traffic controllers.","Accurate Air Traffic Flow Prediction (ATFP) is critical for enhancing airspace safety and efficiency.

47,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Visual Attention in Remote Vehicle Supervision: Examining the Effects of Mental Models and Information Bandwidth,"Advances in automation and aviation technologies have been catalysts for the emerging market of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), an ecosystem of novel aircraft concepts including package delivery drones and passenger carrying air-taxis. Future aircraft operators in this environment will be tasked with remotely supervising multiple highly automated aircraft on a visual interface while receiving less training than traditional pilots. More research should explore how an operator’s potentially limited understanding of an automated system affects visual performance and interactions between human operators and AAM technologies. This study examined the influence of mental models of an autopilot system on visual attention allocation for participants managing multiple vehicles in a low-fidelity AAM simulation environment. Fifty-five participants completed a series of multi-aircraft control scenarios after reading training slides with or without explicit information on the underlying functionality of an autopilot system (Advanced Mental Model or Basic Mental Model groups, respectively) with their eye movements recorded. The results indicated that the Advanced Mental Model group allocated significantly more visual attention to a supplemental data display than the Basic Mental Model group. Surprisingly, participants allocated more visual attention to the supplemental data display with low than high information bandwidth, which was opposite of the predicted effect. The results also indicated a significant interaction between expectancy and value parameters in the SEEV model, providing additional evidence in support of this theoretical debate. In practice, results from this study show that refining mental models through a simple training program could be an effective approach to alter AAM operators’ visual scan behaviors.","Advances in automation and aviation technologies have been catalysts for the emerging market of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), an ecosystem of novel aircraft concepts including package delivery drones and passenger carrying air-taxis.

49,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,High-Stakes Testing and Second Chances: From Data to Models,"High-stakes tests are high pressure, high consequence exams that are used to inform decisions of significant impact, such as educational opportunities, job placement, and career advancement. This dissertation advances the understanding of high-stakes aptitude assessments through empirical examination of the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), focusing on its role in selecting candidates for military aviation training. This research utilizes a rich dataset spanning 2013 to 2020, which includes detailed sociodemographic, educational, and aviation-related data used to evaluate the impact of prior experiences, including retesting, on selection test scores and aviation training performance. Findings reveal complexities in distinguishing innate aptitudes from prior educational and test-related experiences, which are also confounded with sociodemographic variables. Furthermore, retesting provides individuals with limited test-relevant experiences additional opportunities to improve selection test scores. However, large practice effects complicate the interpretation of retest scores, which also exhibit differential prediction; over-predicting training performance outcomes for retesters. These findings underscore the challenges with aptitude assessment within high-stakes settings where candidates are highly motivated to seek out test practice and those recently acquired skills are associated with test scores. This can be problematic when prior experiences, like flight instruction, may be financially prohibitive for otherwise capable individuals. Proposed interventions are discussed and include providing official test preparation to minimize disparities due to unequal access, as well as reassessing the role of certain subtests and retest scores in the selection process. This dissertation contributes to the broader discourse on high-stakes testing and has implications for military policy aimed at the pursuit of a highly capable and representative military aviation community. Through comprehensive statistical analyses and computational modeling, this dissertation provides a nuanced understanding of the ASTB's utility and limitations, suggesting pathways for enhancing equity and predictive validity in military aptitude testing.","High-stakes tests are high pressure, high consequence exams that are used to inform decisions of significant impact, such as educational opportunities, job placement, and career advancement.

Or how to Avoid Dangers of Pseudoscience: Common Standard for Research in Behavioural Analysis and Deception Detection in Aviation Security,"The detection of deception poses one of the main challenges in policing and security environment. It is the inherent goal of security to detect and prevent unlawful events to happen. This is especially true for aviation security as airports continue to constitute attractive targets for terrorist attacks. In consequence, law enforcement agencies are seeking effective and efficient solutions for ensuring high-level security and are often adopting approaches that include behaviour detection. This pressing need for solutions provides ground for pseudoscientific suggestions and methods as those that are cited in an article of the References section. Despite this justified criticism, options to overcome the dangers of pseudoscience are not offered. Therefore, this paper provides a first common standard for conducting research in aviation security for scientists and for practitioners. It highlights several factors that are important to consider before conducting research on behaviour detection. Furthermore, this paper aims to empower experts in the field of aviation security to recognize valid and reliable solutions (e.g., programs, methods, tools) and discusses the relevance as well as the challenges of conducting applied research in the field of aviation security.",The detection of deception poses one of the main challenges in policing and security environment.

This study investigates the impact of Performance Management Systems (PMS) on employee attitudes within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) aviation industry. Specifically, it examines the mediating role of Employee Engagement (EE) and the moderating influence of Organizational Climate (OC), two factors that have been underexplored in the existing literature. Drawing on survey data from 349 aviation industry professionals in the UAE, the study employs Hayes Process Macro to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings reveal that PMS has a significant positive effect on employee attitudes, with EE emerging as a potent mediator. However, OC did not significantly moderate the relationship between PMS and attitude. These insights reveal that enhancing employee engagement through well-structured PMS can lead to more favourable work attitudes and improved organizational outcomes. The study not only bridges critical gaps in existing research but also offers evidence-based recommendations for HR practitioners. As the aviation industry continues to navigate operational complexities and talent challenges, this research underscores the strategic importance of aligning PMS with employee engagement initiatives to drive sustainable success.","AbstractIn today’s dynamic business environment, organizations are increasingly recognizing their workforce as a vital asset, with effective performance management playing a crucial role in driving success.

52,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Comparing the effects of simulated, intelligent audible checklists and analog checklists in simulated flight","This study examined the effect of using a simulated intelligent audible checklist in simulated flight as compared to a standard analog (paper) checklist. Participants were three Western Michigan University students in the College of Aviation. All participants were licensed pilots with instrument ratings. The main dependent variable was the number of checklist errors or omissions committed by the pilots in simulated flight. During each flight, each participant could make up to 42 errors. The error count would initiate at the appropriate time to perform the “before-take off checklist” and would end one minute after parking the plane, the logical time to complete an “after landing checklist.” A multiple baseline design was implemented in this research with the treatment being implemented at a different point in time for each participant. Either stability in performance or a decrement in performance determined the introduction of the audible checklist. Once stability or a descending trend in paper checklist use had been established, each participant was placed in the intervention phase. During baseline phase the three participants averaged 22.7% compliance per flight. After the simulated audible intelligent checklist intervention was introduced compliance increased to 97%. During the reversal phase compliance decreased to an average of 34%. Visual inspection of the data suggests that an intelligent audible checklist used during actual flights may decrease in-flight errors and possibly decrease aviation incidents and accidents.",This study examined the effect of using a simulated intelligent audible checklist in simulated flight as compared to a standard analog (paper) checklist.

However, research literature has indicated that faculty and researchers have themselves conducted plagiarism at alarming rates. Further, there appears to be a large amount of research that has been recycled through egregious self-plagiarism. As aviation research becomes increasingly important to the field of study, it is critical that such research is of high quality, legitimate, and original. This descriptive study investigated the prevalence of plagiarism in aviation research published in five prominent, peer-reviewed research journals (Collegiate Aviation Review, Journal of Air Transportation, International Journal of Applied Aviation Studies, International Journal of Aviation Psychology and Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine). From each of these journals, 30 articles (n = 150) were uploaded to Turnitin plagiarism detection software for analysis. The mean similarity index of the articles was found to be 16.01% (SD = 18.12). A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a statistically significant difference in similarity indices across the five journals, x2 (4, n = 150) = 9.785, p = .044 with the International Journal of Applied Aviation Studies and the International Journal of Aviation Psychology having the highest levels of plagiarism. Within the 150 journal articles, 68 cases (45.3%) met the minimum level of plagiarism (similarity index > 10% as advocated in the literature). Overall, 102 (68%) articles contained instances of self-plagiarism (overlap with material written by an article author without citation). Sham-type (exact text but improperly cited) plagiarism was evident in 88 (59%) of articles and 78 (52%) contained at least one instance of verbatim-type (exact text without citation) plagiarism.

That transition is known as the landing flare and allows the aircraft to gently settle on its main landing gear. Nevertheless, landing flare accident rates are relatively high and past studies have implicated flaws in flare instruction. This study tested the effectiveness and ergonomics of an alternative landing flare method. Twenty-six participants with no prior aviation background were trained to land a Cessna 182S simulator. Control participants were provided with traditional landing flare instruction and experimental participants with a discriminative auditory cue. Results indicated that control participants flared significantly higher, registered higher impacts at touchdown, and appeared to initiate the flare in a trial-and-error fashion. Thus, applying simple behavioral concepts to flare training may facilitate proper flares and reduce landing flare accidents rates.","The transition from a controlled descent to actual contact with the runway surface is crucial to a successful landing.

56,2025,Cognitive Research,Eye movements as predictors of student experiences during nursing simulation learning events,"Although the “eye-mind link” hypothesis posits that eye movements provide a direct window into cognitive processing, linking eye movements to specific cognitions in real-world settings remains challenging. This challenge may arise because gaze metrics such as fixation duration, pupil size, and saccade amplitude are often aggregated across timelines that include heterogeneous events. To address this, we tested whether aggregating gaze parameters across participant-defined events could support the hypothesis that increased focal processing, indicated by greater gaze duration and pupil diameter, and decreased scene exploration, indicated by smaller saccade amplitude, would predict effective task performance. Using head-mounted eye trackers, nursing students engaged in simulation learning and later segmented their simulation footage into meaningful events, categorizing their behaviors, task outcomes, and cognitive states at the event level. Increased fixation duration and pupil diameter predicted higher student-rated teamwork quality, while increased pupil diameter predicted judgments of effective communication. Additionally, increased saccade amplitude positively predicted students’ perceived self-efficacy. These relationships did not vary across event types, and gaze parameters did not differ significantly between the beginning, middle, and end of events. However, there was a significant increase in fixation duration during the first five seconds of an event compared to the last five seconds of the previous event, suggesting an initial encoding phase at an event boundary. In conclusion, event-level gaze parameters serve as valid indicators of focal processing and scene exploration in natural learning environments, generalizing across event types.","Although the “eye-mind link” hypothesis posits that eye movements provide a direct window into cognitive processing, linking eye movements to specific cognitions in real-world settings remains challenging. This challenge may arise because gaze metrics such as fixation duration, pupil size, and saccade amplitude are often aggregated across timelines that include heterogeneous events. To address this, we tested whether aggregating gaze parameters across participant-defined events could support the hypothesis that increased focal processing, indicated by greater gaze duration and pupil diameter, and decreased scene exploration, indicated by smaller saccade amplitude, would predict effective task performance.","<title>Eye movements as predictors of student experiences during nursing simulation learning events</title> <excerpt>Although the “eye-mind link” hypothesis posits that eye movements provide a direct window into cognitive processing, linking eye movements to specific cognitions in real-world settings remains challenging.

57,2025,PLoS One,Pre-training heart rate variability as a predictor of Air Force Academy completion,"IntroductionOperational pilots are required to perform complex tasks under high stress and uncertainty. One of the major challenges of aviation medicine is the selection of suitable candidates to serve as pilots. The vagal nerve is a crucial moderator of stress responses, and its activity (indexed by heart rate variability, HRV) reflects psycho-physiological resilience and has been shown to predict performance in various settings. However, its predictive value in pilot training has not been examined. This study examined the relationship between HRV and success in an intensive and long pilot course.MethodsIn a historical prospective study, we derived an HRV parameter (RMSSD) from a 10-second ECG of 169 male and 16 female candidates attending a 3-year pilots’ course. The ECGs were performed 2–3 months before the courses. The predictive validity of other routinely obtained measures was also considered. Data were analyzed in two ways. First, we analyzed the entire sample using t-tests. Then, significant predictors of success and HRV were entered in a multivariate logistic regression. Second, we focused on a smaller sample of paired candidates (passed vs. failed), matched on significant predictors, and then examined differences in HRV between these groups using a paired t-test.ResultsHigh RMSSD significantly predicted the completion of the pilot course in a multivariate logistic regression. RMSSD and the selection test formula score were the only significant predictors. In the paired matched sample, candidates who passed the course had significantly higher initial HRV (M = 121.30ms) compared to those who failed (M = 84.31ms; t(25)= 1.78, p < 0.05).ConclusionThe current study supports the predictive value of HRV for aviation selection. Given the high cost of training operational pilots and the physical and mental burdens they undergo, improved accuracy of the selection processes may be crucial.","IntroductionOperational pilots are required to perform complex tasks under high stress and uncertainty.

58,2025,Cognitive Research,Process-based measures in high-stakes testing: practical implications for construct validity within military aviation selection,"This paper looks at how process-based spatial ability and attention measures taken within a high-stakes battery used to select pilots in the US Navy compare to lab-based measures of the same constructs. Process-based measures typically function by having individuals perform either a novel task or perform a task with novel stimuli. However, applicants often spend time practicing the tasks prior to taking the battery. A group of 307 Naval Flight Students participated in the study, in which they took several spatial ability, attention and general processing measures. One of the spatial tasks used in the study was the same as the spatial task in the Navy’s pilot selection battery, which all of the participants had taken. All of the lab spatial ability measures including the one used in the selection battery were highly correlated and loaded onto the same spatial ability factor. However, the high-stakes spatial subtest was not correlated with any of the lab spatial measures including the same test administered in the lab. The lab spatial ability data was also correlated with training outcomes whereas the high-stakes process spatial and attention measures were not. The high-stakes attention measure was weakly correlated with some of the general processing measures. The pattern of results suggest that familiarity with the spatial and attention tasks in the high-stakes environment may be negating those tests ability to measure the constructs they were designed to measure, and also reducing their effectiveness to predict training performance. Statement of significance: This paper addresses an increasingly difficult challenge the Navy is facing within aviation selection, in that applicants are highly motivated and have access to unofficial replicas of the Navy’s test battery. The challenge is specific to the process-based measures such as spatial ability and attention that rely on some degree of novelty to work. When applicants practice these types of tests they can practice to the test, memorize items, and learn strategies which impact the test’s ability to measure the cognitive construct it was designed to measure as well as reduces its ability to predict flight training outcomes. This is particularly problematic as the unofficial test preparation software can replicate a new test within days. While the data presented here are limited to spatial ability and attention within military pilot selection it applies to a much broader community of researchers. Anyone developing a high-stakes test with a large and motivated applicant pool may also see their process-based measures perform differently in a high-stakes environment than a low stakes laboratory one in which participants are naïve to the tasks they are taking. The extent to which practice can alter the effectiveness of high-stakes test performance is an important one. The results of the paper suggest that test developers should assume participants are practiced and assess the extent to which practice on process-based measure impacts the tasks ability to measure the construct of interest and predict performance.","This paper looks at how process-based spatial ability and attention measures taken within a high-stakes battery used to select pilots in the US Navy compare to lab-based measures of the same constructs.

Literature conceptually supports the need for highly reliable health care facilities but does not show a comprehensive approach to operationalizing the concept into the daily workforce to support patients. The Veterans Health Administration closes the gap by documenting a case study that not only demonstrates specific actions and functions that create a high-reliability organization (HRO) for safety and improvement but also created a learning organization by spreading the knowledge to other facilities.Design/methodology/approachThe authors instituted a methodology consisting of assessments, training and educational simulations to measure, establish and operationalize activities that identified and prevented harmful events. Visual communication boards were created to facilitate team huddles and discuss improvement ideas. Improvements were then measured and analyzed for purposeful outcomes and return on investment (ROI).FindingsHRO can be operationalized successfully in health care systems. Measurable outcomes verified that psychological safety was achieved through the identification and participation of 3,184 process improvement projects over a five-year period, which yielded a US$2.8m ROI. Documented processes and activities were used for educational teachings, which were disseminated to other Veteran Affairs Medical Center’s through the Truman HRO Academy.Practical implicationsThis case study is limited to one hospital in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) network. As the VHA continues to deploy the methods outlined to other hospitals, the authors will perform incremental data collection and ongoing analysis for further validation of the HRO methods and operations. Hospitalists can adapt the methods in the case study for practical application in a health care setting outside of VHA. Although the model is rooted in health care, the methods may be adapted for use in other industries.Originality/valueThis case study overcomes the limitations within literature regarding operationalizing HRO by providing actual activities and demonstrations that can be implemented by other health care facilities.","PurposeThis study demonstrates how becoming a high-reliability institution in health care is a priority, given the high-risk environment in which an error can result in harm.

This study aims to understand the key factors contributing to the successful adoption and usage of self-service check-in kiosks. We examine how flow experience and user acceptance are influenced by perceived performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions within the context of Soekarno-Hatta Airport. The study employs an electronic questionnaire and partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data. The results indicate that social influence and facilitating conditions significantly enhance flow experience, which positively influences passengers’ intention to continue to use SST. These findings contribute to the theoretical expansion of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating the concept of flow experience and providing practical insights for enhancing passenger engagement and satisfaction through SST in airports.","AbstractThe aviation industry has undergone significant transformation due to the adoption of self-service technology (SST), which aims to enhance operational efficiency and passenger experience.

This study was built on previous research investigating taxiing from the gate to the runway based on speed and time commands to include speed-based taxiing with bounds. Commercial airline pilots, both current and recently retired, participated in this study at the Human-Centered Systems Lab at NASA Ames Research Center. This study showed that pilots viewed the primary flight display more than when taxiing in the defined condition than the undefined condition. This resulted in more head down time on the primary flight display.

63,2025,Cognitive Research,Auditory–tactile presentation accelerates target detection in a multitasking situation,"There is ample evidence from cognitive sciences and neurosciences studies that multisensory stimuli are detected better and faster than their unisensory counterparts. Yet, most of this work has been conducted in settings and with protocols within which participants had the sole detection task to perform. In realistic and complex environments, such as military ones, detection of critical information has to be performed while the operator is concurrently managing several others tasks and processing a vast amount of sensory inputs. To date, it remains to determine whether multisensory benefits for detection hold true in complex multitasking situations. In the present study, we compared the detection performance of healthy participants when the target was only auditory, only tactile, or both auditory and tactile. Detection performance was measured in a simple detection task condition and in a multitasking condition. In the latter, participants had to detect the targets while concurrently performing the subtasks of the MATB-II environment, designed in the 90s by NASA to simulate piloting tasks. Multisensory acceleration of reaction times was larger during multitasking compared to single-task conditions. Crucially, participants detected auditory–tactile targets faster than their unisensory counterparts. While previous studies have reported such facilitation effects in single-task contexts, our results show that multisensory facilitation of detection speed does occur in a realistic multitasking environment and is larger than in simple task conditions. Auditory-tactile displays seem to have the potential to enhance information presentation and could be used in applied settings like military aviation.","There is ample evidence from cognitive sciences and neurosciences studies that multisensory stimuli are detected better and faster than their unisensory counterparts.

Specifically, the study investigated student pilots’ scanning behavior, cognitive strategies, and proficiency development on a normal approach and landing task by modeling flight instructors’ cognitive behavior. The first research phase revealed statistically significant differences in scanning ratios between 10 flight instructors and 10 student pilots along with substantial performance variation. The result showed that student pilots exhibited excessive outside fixation, often failing to monitor or respond to energy management in a timely manner. In the second research phase, a separate cohort of 10 student pilots took part in a structured training intervention—comprising three training modules—designed to model flight instructors’ scanning behavior and gain an understanding of cognitive awareness. Post-intervention analysis shows student pilots exhibited a significant reduction in excessive outside fixation and alignment toward flight instructors’ scanning ratios along with performance improvements per ACS standards for the Private Pilot airplane. Thematic analysis of student pilots’ interviews across the training modules highlighted the value of technology-assisted learning for enhancing conceptual clarity and self-assessment and for reducing teaching ambiguity with a deliberate, cognitively engaged learning style by bridging the instructional gap beyond the traditional training method.","This interdisciplinary study employed a convergent parallel mixed-methods design to advance innovation in aviation education by incorporating eye tracking technology with enhanced performance traceability through visual modeling and comparative feedback.

65,2025,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Psychological Profiles of Individuals Involved in US Air Force Aircraft Mishaps: A Latent Class Analysis,"The purpose of this study was to explore and better understand the psychological and medical factors that may have influenced Class A and B mishaps from 2012 to 2022. The United States Air Force (USAF) defines a mishap as any unintended Air or Space Force occurrence that results in death, injury, illness, or property damage (Air Force Safety Center, 2024). Class A and B mishaps are defined as the most severe based on the extent and monetary cost of damage and/or injury. On average, mishap trends for this branch of service suggest major improvements in flight safety over time (Light, et al., 2020). However, severe mishaps continue to occur even with improved safety and increased prevention efforts. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used as the primary method to identify––within the Class A and B aircraft mishaps––subgroups with similar patterns of mental health characteristics. The study used a secondary dataset that was extracted from the Department of Defense (DoD, 2005) Human Factors Analysis and Classification System 7.0. The data was extracted from the years 2012 to 2022. A total of 540 mishap cases were analyzed using information from 5 different aircrafts models. LCA revealed a three-class solution for three previously unidentified latent classes. The larger group was determined by mental awareness factors only, the second largest group was determined by state of mind, teamwork, and mental awareness factors. Lastly, a third group was strongly defined by sensory misconception, environmental problems, and mental awareness factors. Results of logistic regression revealed that the group of individuals (Class 2) defined by a combination of cognitive and psychological factors had a higher probability of making judgment and decision-making errors, as well as performance-based errors, compared to the other two groups. The results of this project may support aviation safety and help identify common person-level characteristics and trends associated with these categories of mishaps. Clinical implications include more detailed understanding of the functional impact of the interactions of psychological and cognitive factors which can better inform treatment planning and performance optimization plans.

66,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Pilot Salient Identity Influencing Critical Incident Sensemaking in General Aviation Organizational Safety,"One critical category of aviation safety is the human factor. This dissertation approached the human factor from the perspective of personal identity and how a transference of identity, or a nonpilot identity, becomes salient and affects pilot decisions.Critical incident technique was used to analyze 193 incidents in the Aviation Safety Reporting System database from January 2008 to December 2009 documenting weather and maneuvering incidents when a ""near-miss"" occurred. Of these 193 incidents, 11 were found to contain a direct reference to salient identity and six were interpreted to have a more indirect, contextual relationship to salient identity. Those in the direct category related to identities as a professional (two cases), business person (two cases), family role (four cases), social or friendship-related role (two cases), and hobbiest (one case). In all 11 cases, the GA pilots were advised of the adverse circumstances in the initial flight planning and ignored them, choosing instead to pursue the flight and acting counter to the role of a safe pilot. Emotions were also evident in the narratives, as when a pilot made an unnecessary emergency landing because of anxiety about his family, and the salient identity was interpreted as affecting cognition and judgment.This study had five findings. (1) Pilots in the incidents discussed in this study showed a salient identity other than pilot, which directly influenced their sensemaking. (2) GA pilots' emotions during critical incidents had a direct effect on their judgment. (3) The pilots' nonpilot identity led to overconfidence, most evident in this study through numerous incidents of ""get-there-itis."" Get-there-itis, as well as other poor pilot decisions, could have been avoided through better preflight planning. (4) Other poor judgments linked to nonpilot salient identities were related to lack of situational awareness and overreliance on technology. (5) Social or group considerations were associated with nonpilot salient identities and poor judgments.This qualitative study provides a contribution to the literature and to national data evaluation efforts by providing more insight into the roles of identity and sensemaking in GA safety.","One critical category of aviation safety is the human factor.

AMTs constitute the bulk of the workers in an MRO. By default, a safety culture and safety consciousness existed in MROs prior to an SMS, and this study was conducted to understand the perceptions of the AMTs in the MROs with an SMS and whether the SMS had an impact on safety culture and safety consciousness after implementation. General system theory grounded the theoretical framework in an effort to explain how all system elements interact with one another. Interviewed AMTs were questioned on perceptions of safety consciousness and safety culture since the implementation of the SMS in their MRO. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 12 AMTs. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data to produce an account of the phenomenon. Six themes were identified through this analysis: (a) positive aspects of SMS adoption and implementation, (b) strategies and considerations on SMS adoption and implementation, (c) improvements in reporting and safety measures, (d) increased participation and involvement, (e) positive changes in safety culture, and (f) increased accountability and oversight.

68,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The wrong Wright stuff: Mapping human error in aviation,"The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) was instituted to aid the Federal Aviation Administration in tracking trends in aviation incidents so that, ultimately, safety measures and training could be implemented to decrease the occurrence of accidents and incidents within the industry. The current system relies on hand coding of reports to recognize current trends and alert the proper parties. Although the filing party may enter some codified data describing the surrounding scenario (e.g., time of day, weather), there is no opportunity to specify a category if the problem is human error. Considering the prevalence of human error within these incidents (around 55% based on a report by Boeing, 2006), a greater understanding of the driving factors is needed.The current study was an investigation of the human error components of airline incident reports. Text analysis tools were applied to ASRS incident narrative reports to determine a classification based on human performance for commercial and general aviation. The results from the current study demonstrate that an empirically based approach can be used to uncover latent categories within the ""Flight Crew Human Performance"" classified reports. The combined approach of latent semantic analysis, kmeans clustering, and keyword analysis were used successfully in developing a nine element classification of commercial aviation reports and twelve element classification of general aviation reports. The taxonomies suggested by the current study for both commercial and general aviation reveal categories beyond just human error elements. The classification scheme suggested for the commercial aviation reports most closely resembled the ACCERS taxonomy developed by Krokos and Baker (2005; see also Baker & Krokos, 2007), which was constructed to help in categorizing all incident reports. The classification suggested for general aviation reports did not closely resemble any existing classification scheme. Although the suggested taxonomy shared categories such as situational awareness and communication with classifications such as crew resource management (CRM) or single pilot resource management (SRM), the current classification also holds non-human elements such as weather and context.The taxonomies for both commercial and general aviation revealed a category for context, and the difficulty of flying into certain airports was apparent. These findings can be implemented to improve training programs by assisting in the creation of contextually based training scenarios.

69,2026,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),Instructional modality influences neurocognitive engagement during moral learning,"AI-mediated learning environments demand more subtle comprehension of how instructional modalities impact not only learning outcomes, but cognitive and affective processes supporting them. Moral education is a common denominator of integral development, yet we do not know how neurocognitive engagement varies with new versus old media. This experiment compared moral learning conveyed by a GPT-mediated social robot (Picoh) with that through traditional text-based reading, with an Indian philosophical fable. Fifty students were randomly assigned to a modality and completed a comprehension quiz while their neural activity was recorded with Electroencephalography (EEG). Two indices were compared: frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), an affective–motivational engagement index, and gamma coherence, a cognitive integration index. No group differences were found in quiz performance or EEG measures. However, in the robot group, FAA showed a negative trend with comprehension, which may point toward a potential link between comprehension and left-frontal activation (approach motivation). These findings illustrate that neurophysiological measures can disentangle subtle, individual-level engagement effects undetectable to behavioral outcomes alone. More broadly, the findings explored the value of combining EEG with behavioral data in revealing mechanistic comprehension of how instructional modalities impact learning.","AI-mediated learning environments demand more subtle comprehension of how instructional modalities impact not only learning outcomes, but cognitive and affective processes supporting them.

70,2024,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Emotional Turbulence During Simulation Training : Unraveling Emotion Dynamics and Performance Accuracy Using Simulations for Pilot Training,"Affective responses, such as stress and emotions, are discussed as factors influencing human error in aviation; however, aviation research tends to explore affect as a subordinate element of cognition. Yet, more and more research is demonstrating that affective responses have a considerable effect on performance accuracy. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation is to examine the impact of pilots’ affective responses on their flying performance accuracy in the context of training using simulations. The investigation started by synthesizing findings of previous research exploring affect and performance when using flight simulations, in a systematic literature review. Based on the findings of the literature review and previous research in education and psychology, two empirical studies were conducted aiming to understand the influence of emotions dynamics in flying performance. Emotions dynamics refer to the patterns and regularities characterizing fluctuations in emotions over time. Thus, the first study examines changes in performance and emotions dynamics (i.e., frequency, intensity, and variability of emotional responses) across training phases and difficulty levels in a flight simulation. The second empirical study builds on the previous one by examining the relationship between emotional variability and flying performance moderated by pilot trainees’ perceived control and value over the task. The findings of this dissertation provide strong evidence that trainees’ performance accuracy when performing simulated flying tasks is connected to their emotional responses. Particularly, findings from the empirical studies suggest that emotion dynamics might have adaptive functions for improving flying accuracy. Results demonstrate that affect and performance are dynamically impacted by training phases, difficulty levels, and subjective perceptions over the task. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions, limitations, and future directions.","Affective responses, such as stress and emotions, are discussed as factors influencing human error in aviation; however, aviation research tends to explore affect as a subordinate element of cognition.

Although voluntary reporting systems are valuable tools for uncovering error causal factors, they are often underutilized. This thesis identified barriers and facilitators to effective voluntary reporting practices through a literature review and interviews with industry professionals. Identified barriers include insufficient organizational commitment to safety culture, lack of user trust in voluntary reporting systems and in management, unclear system policy and procedure definition, inadequate training techniques, and ineffective use of voluntary reports to implement meaningful solutions.Following the identification of these barriers, a questionnaire was distributed to test for statistically significant variations in reporting perceptions between system users and management. Responses from 30 mechanics and 27 managers revealed vast underreporting of reportable events and significant discrepancies in reporting perceptions based on age, work experience, and familiarity with voluntary reporting systems. Results also showed inconsistent views of justification for non-reporting. These findings were used to quantify the relative magnitudes of the identified barriers and to offer recommendations for minimizing their effect on voluntary reporting.","Federal agencies responsible for defining standards in high-risk industries (such as aviation, rail, and healthcare) promote voluntary reporting of personally committed errors and violations as a way to meet safety management system requirements.

73,2024,European Journal of Training and Development,Flying high: pilot peer coaching to champion well-being and mitigate hazardous attitudes,"PurposeThe “Germanwings” air crash in 2015 in which 150 people were killed highlighted the challenges pilots working in the aviation industry face. Pilots regularly work for extensive periods in inhospitable and high-pressure operational conditions, exposing them to considerable work-related stress. This has raised calls for a more systemic cultural change across the aviation industry, championing a more holistic perspective of pilot health and well-being. The study aims to explore how peer coaching (PC) can promote an inclusive psychosocial safety climate enhancing pilot well-being and can mitigate hazardous attitudes and dysfunctional behaviours.Design/methodology/approachAdopting an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were conducted with military and civilian peer coach/coachee pilots and key industry stakeholders, totalling 39 participants. The research provided significant insights into the perceived value of PC in promoting both pilot health and mental well-being (MW) and flight safety across the aviation industry.FindingsThe study highlights four key PC superordinate themes, namely, coaching skills, significance of well-being, building of peer relationships and importance of confidentiality and autonomy. Such combined themes build reciprocal trust within peer conversations that can inspire engagement and effectively promote personal well-being. The contagious effect of such local interventions can help stimulate systemic cultural change and promote a positive psychosocial safety climate throughout an organisation and, in this case, across the aviation industry. This study provides a PC conceptual framework “Mutuality Equality Goals Autonomy Non-evaluative feedback, Skill Confidentiality Voluntary Supervisory (MEGANS CVS),” highlighting the salient features of PC in promoting MW.Research limitations/implicationsThe study highlights the salient features of PC and its role in promoting peer conversations that enable personal transition, openness and acceptance. This study also highlights how PC and well-being can be used to encourage inclusivity and engagement, thereby strengthening institutional resilience.Practical implicationsThis study highlights how PC that can assist HRM/HRD professionals to embed a more inclusive and salutogenic approach to MW that can reshape organisational cultures. This study highlights the significance and link of workplace stress to hazardous attitudes and dysfunctional behaviours. It further notes that whilst the MEGANS CVS peer coaching framework has been applied to pilots, it can also be applied across all sectors and levels.Social implicationsThis study highlights the value of PC as an inexpensive means to engage at the grassroots level, which not only improves personal performance, safety and well-being but by building peer relationships can also act as a catalyst for positive and deep organisational cultural change.Originality/valueThis study offers the MEGANS CVS framework that exposes insights into PC practice that can assist HRM/HRD professionals embed a more inclusive and salutogenic approach to health and well-being that can reshape organisational cultures. This study highlights the significance and link of workplace stress to hazardous attitudes and dysfunctional behaviours, and whilst this framework has been applied to pilots, it can also have relevance across all sectors and levels. This study calls for a “salutogenic turn,” employing MW and PC to transform organisational capabilities to be more forward-thinking and solution-focused, promoting an inclusive “just culture” where leaders positively lead their people.","PurposeThe “Germanwings” air crash in 2015 in which 150 people were killed highlighted the challenges pilots working in the aviation industry face.

74,2025,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Estimating Price Responsiveness for Service of a Luxury Transportation Company: A Zero Inflated Poisson Approach,"Estimating price sensitivity is crucial for premium service providers who face inconsistent client engagement. In this study, I investigate both observed ride demand and periods of client inactivity among ABC Transfer’s customers, meaning individuals who may not book rides in a given period but are not necessarily disengaged. ABC Transfer is a luxury ground transportation firm headquartered in upstate South Carolina. Using an unbalanced panel dataset spanning 2012 to 2024, I estimate a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model to distinguish between individuals who might still be clients from those who are not likely to be clients any longer. The model accounts for price sensitivity across client types (personal, corporate, aviation) through interaction terms and incorporates time-fixed effects to control for changes in market conditions.Results show that price is significantly negatively associated with ride volume, with a one-dollar increase in price predicting a 0.55% decrease in expected ride count for the baseline aviation client. While corporate and personal accounts exhibit similar sensitivity to price, their interaction terms are not statistically significant in the count model, indicating that the effect of price on ride demand does not differ meaningfully between account types after controlling for other variables. Corporate clients take significantly fewer transfer rides overall, with an estimated 72% lower ride activity relative to aviation clients.In the inflation portion of the ZIP model, which estimates the likelihood that an individual who does not book a ride is no longer an active client, higher prices significantly reduce the probability of disengagement. These results suggest that while price increases may suppress ride frequency, they do not necessarily lead clients to abandon the service. Price sensitivity varies by client type in this regard: both personal and corporate clients are significantly less likely than aviation clients to disengage in response to price increases, indicating a stronger likelihood of remaining engaged with the platform.Simulations using the Poisson component of the initial model predict that a $100 price reduction would yield the largest increases in ride volume among aviation clients, with more modest effects for corporate and personal clients. Strong temporal effects in both model components reflect market growth over time and cohort effects among clients in early periods. These findings suggest that while price influences ride frequency, it plays a more complex role in long-term client engagement. For luxury transportation providers, differentiated pricing strategies by client type may help maintain participation even as prices fluctuate, highlighting the importance of loyalty among high-value clients and the strategic potential of targeted retention efforts.A second specification of the zero-inflated Poisson model was estimated to address the possibility that the average price an individual would face while potentially being a client is correlated with unobserved individual characteristics that also influence ride demand. This average price, calculated as the mean of the prices a client did pay or would have paid across observed periods, is included as a Mundlak control.","Estimating price sensitivity is crucial for premium service providers who face inconsistent client engagement.

The present study investigated the relationships between individual difference variables and pilot cockpit error in an attempt to understand the factors that may contribute to accidents caused by human error. It was expected that personality characteristics, individual attitudes, and cognitive ability would affect pilot situational awareness, pilot psychological stress levels, and pilot hazardous thought patterns, which would subsequently affect pilot error type and frequency. Three hundred Army student helicopter pilots were rated on errors during two evaluation check rides. Results indicate inconsistent support for these hypotheses. Situational awareness and psychological stress levels are related to pilot error; however, individual differences that impact the development of situational awareness or that contribute to pilot stress level remain in question.","Pilot error is cited as the cause of over 80 percent of aviation accidents.

77,2025,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),A novel q-ROHFS prospect theory based MABAC method for failure mode risk prioritization in aircraft landing systems,"Failure mode risk prioritization is crucial in aircraft landing systems, where undetected or misjudged failures can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Effective risk analysis enables proactive maintenance and enhances aviation safety in such critical phases of flight. In this study, a novel hybrid decision-making framework is proposed to prioritize failure modes in aircraft landing systems by integrating the Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) method with Prospect Theory under a q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Set (q-ROHFS) environment. Traditional failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) approaches often suffer from rigid weighting schemes, lack of sensitivity to expert hesitancy, and an inability to incorporate psychological factors such as risk aversion or subjective evaluations—especially in high-risk domains like aviation. To address these limitations, the proposed model incorporates human psychological behaviour and uncertainty in expert assessments. Prospect Theory is employed to capture decision makers’ risk attitudes and reference-dependent evaluations, while q-ROHFSs allow more flexible and comprehensive representation of hesitant and uncertain information. In this approach, Best-Worst Method (BWM) is used to determine the relative importance of risk factors for each decision maker, and their individual weights are obtained using TOPSIS-based similarity measures. A novel generalized q-ROHF Minkowski distance measure is also introduced and implemented to determine the weights of decision makers in the TOPSIS method, as well as to construct the prospect decision matrix and the distance matrix in the MABAC method, thereby enhancing computational precision. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through a real-world case study on aircraft landing systems, and a sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness of the results. The findings highlight the method’s capability to reflect expert preferences more realistically and improve risk prioritization decisions in complex safety-critical systems.","Failure mode risk prioritization is crucial in aircraft landing systems, where undetected or misjudged failures can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

While psychometric studies have been conducted in training programs administered by the airlines themselves, little research has been done in this area on the processes and tools used by the FAA. The limited research that has been conducted suggested that the interrater reliability (IRR) of current assessments could be questionable. A version of the instrument currently in use by the FAA and two other instruments were used by active FAA inspectors who viewed eight videotaped scenarios of staged cockpit activities. Generalizability Theory (GT) analysis (Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, & Rajaratnam, 1972) was chosen because of its ability to address multiple error sources in a single analytical framework. The main effect for raters was less than expected, normally a sign of good MR, but a substantial interaction effect was found between raters and the rating situation. An expected substantial effect was found between types of instruments, but the individual performance of each was found to be nearly equivalent in terms of allocation of error sources and generalizability coefficients. Further substantial situation-dependent effects were found when analyses were conducted for individual scenarios. The findings that the assessments made by these raters were highly variable between situations and types of instruments suggest problems with construct validity and definition of the dimensions of performance being evaluated. While there appears to be some consistency in the patterns of overall scoring, there appears to be considerable ambiguity with regard to measured constructs and related operational definitions that underlie the instruments' scales.","This dissertation presents research on the psychometric properties of the instruments used by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety inspectors to assess the cockpit performance of airline crews.

The sample of interest for this research project was full-time collegiate flight instructors.   This two-part research study consisted of a one-time, online survey and two focus groups. Data analysis showed that pilots who rated their work as requiring more effort also had the largest amount of total time and longest amount of time spent as a flight instructor. There was also evidence for a positive relationship between conscientiousness and professional efficacy, but not overcommitment. Lastly, the data collected during this survey more closely followed the job demand-resources model of job stress than the effort-reward imbalance model. In the second phase of the study, two focus groups were conducted. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes that described the content discussed during the focus groups.

81,2025,PQDT - Global,Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Methods on Social Media,"Social media has rapidly transformed into a key platform in which people express thoughts, feelings, as well as reactions towards current events, political decisions, social issues, also commercial experiences. Among those platforms, Twitter distinguishes itself via the relative brevity of the posts as well as the large intensity of more public interaction, making it such a perfect ground for sentiment analysis. In this thesis, the sole focus lies upon extracting meaningful emotional patterns from user-generated content which is on Twitter by using machine learning algorithms. The research scope is not restricted solely to sentiment polarity identification but stretches toward the structural optimisation of sentiment analysis models using Azerbaijani-language data, with specific emphasis upon recent sociopolitical discourse touching aviation incidents.Instead of the usual surveys and structured feedback forms, Twitter posts show several spontaneous reactions. These reactions, completely unfiltered, contain nothing that acts as a filter. This spontaneity introduces linguistic noise, informal syntax, and wide-ranging usage of abbreviations, emojis, and colloquialisms within the Azerbaijani language, particularly because it lacks adequate annotated corpora for computational analysis. To overcome these limitations, the study adopts a strict preprocessing pipeline that includes spelling normalization, tokenization, removal of stop words, in addition to lemmatization, with careful handling of non-standard text elements. After filtering, the data is vectorized using word embeddings, specifically Word2Vec and BERT. This permits semantic and contextual representation far beyond frequency analysis alone.The dataset was additionally improved via established stratified sampling techniques so as to ensure balanced representation of sentiments, thereby minimising bias in model training as well as within evaluation. Beyond just classical evaluation metrics, confusion matrices were analysed in a visual way for classification errors and also to help refine the decision boundaries within the models. Attention was paid in addition to temporal trends that are within sentiment expression, revealing shifts in emotional tone during phases that are within public discourse. Language-specific challenges, such as a scarcity of sentiment lexicons and of pre-trained models in Azerbaijani, were reduced via manual annotation as well as domain adaptation strategies. For further improved model generalisation, k-fold cross-validation was applied along with hyperparameter tuning via randomised search.The machine learning algorithms applied—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest—were completely compared utilising metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, as well as F1-score. Each model was evaluated both on a general sentiment dataset with emotionally tagged keywords such as ""love"", ""hate"", ""disappointed"", as well as on one context-specific dataset of Azerbaijani tweets related to the Aktauda aviation incident. The results do show Random Forest and SVM manage subtle language cues in a better way than Logistic Regression does, especially in irony, blame, or sarcasm, but Logistic Regression is okay in simple contexts. Among these, Random Forest emerged as being the most strong while reaching up to 89% in accuracy. It demonstrated performance balanced across some sentiment classes.The analysis does also confirm social media posts as expressive indicators for public emotion and function as a lens through which political and cultural narratives then unfold. For instance, tweets about that aviation incident communicated no less than fear and grief, but also politically charged accusations together with calls for accountability. These feelings, when charted, display public trust, anger, or admiration, each varying as a reaction to government and world responses. This confirms the total planned value of sentiment analysis within public policy evaluation, crisis communication, and within media monitoring.Through integration of domain-specific feature engineering, alongside contextual embeddings, and incorporation of linguistic particularities natural to the Azerbaijani language, this study contributes a methodological framework that is adaptable for many under-resourced languages. It puts forward also a rather dynamic approach for sentiment classification. This approach remains effective within a constantly evolving online vernacular. In contrast to static, lexicon-based models, this ensemble learning method is more responsive to present data, enabling institutions, journalists, and researchers to interpret digital emotions faster and more accurately. To conclude, the research shows sentiment analysis on Twitter with machine learning is far more than mere computation; it is a socio-technical study of just how societies feel and then voice emotion online. By decoding emotional undercurrents within social media discourse, notably during times of crisis, decision-makers are better equipped to understand collective psychology, respond to misinformation directly, and engage with citizens meaningfully in the era of digitised public opinion.","Social media has rapidly transformed into a key platform in which people express thoughts, feelings, as well as reactions towards current events, political decisions, social issues, also commercial experiences.

The theoretical framework for this study was based on Maslow’s (1943) hierarchy of needs, highlighting the importance of fulfilling basic psychological requirements for overall well-being. Using a mixed method approach, survey questionnaires and semi-structured questions were used to collect data. Findings revealed that the abrupt halting of the aviation industry of operations led to increased anxiety and depression among employees, exacerbated by job insecurity and isolation. Participants emphasized the importance of social connections in fostering positive mental health and shared coping strategies, such as engaging in physical activities. The theoretical framework was derived from Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which illustrated that unmet physiological and safety needs hinder psychological well-being. This study contributed to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) by highlighting the importance of mental health support in the workplace. Practical implications suggest the need for mental health support programs and clear communication from employers, while policy recommendations advocated for robust safety nets for affected workers. This study highlights the urgent need to address mental health challenges within the aviation sector, ensuring the well-being of professionals as they navigate crises and prepare for recovery.","This article explores the psychological impact of grounding the aviation industry as a restrictive measure to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe.

83,2025,Cognitive Research,High-stakes psychomotor ability assessment: a military selection case study of practice effects in airplane tracking tasks,"Aviation selection tests are high-stakes assessments designed to identify candidates capable of succeeding in demanding flight environments. Most branches of the US military incorporate both content-based and process-based assessments to evaluate prior knowledge and reasoning ability, respectively. A challenge with high-stakes process tests is that their validity requires participant naivety, which is increasingly difficult to maintain in the modern internet era. As such, these high-stakes tests must be continuously evaluated to ensure the most valid, reliable, and cost-effective selection procedures are employed. To address this, we examined practice effects in the psychomotor airplane tracking tasks of the Navy’s Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB). We had 146 Naval Flight Students and 119 enlisted Sailors perform the ASTB’s psychomotor battery six times across two days. Results revealed large practice effects, shifting in rank ordering of individuals across attempts, and that psychomotor performance had not stabilized even by the sixth attempt. Prior action video gaming and flight simulator gaming experience correlated with psychomotor performance, with some evidence that improvements were related, albeit weakly, to either gaming experience or initial performance. Finally, correlations between psychomotor performance and eventual naval flight training scores were stable across the six attempts, but simulations indicated predictive validity can range widely if participants have differing levels of practice from one another. Overall, these findings indicate that the psychomotor component of the ASTB is a valuable inclusion to the Naval Flight School selection process but also could benefit from further refinement.","Aviation selection tests are high-stakes assessments designed to identify candidates capable of succeeding in demanding flight environments.

84,2025,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),Evaluating the effectiveness of flight simulator training on developing perceptual-motor skills among flight cadets: a pilot study,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of flight simulator training on the enhancement of perceptual-motor skills among flight cadets. Perceptual-motor skills act as a crucial link through which pilots translate their environmental perceptions into precise maneuvers, a capability that is particularly vital in dynamic and unpredictable flight environments. A total of forty cadets participated in the experiment and were randomly assigned to either the Traditional Training Group (TTG) or the Efficient Training Group (ETG). The TTG received individual training on training aircraft under the supervision of an instructor, while the ETG trained on expert aircraft using a full-scenario memory replay training system enhanced with multimodal information feedback. The simulations were conducted at the Aeronautical University simulation laboratory, configured as a self-developed Flight Skill Accelerated Training Simulator. Both groups completed eight weeks of simulated flight training, which included testing scenarios such as takeoff, flight control, landing, and carrier landing. Results indicated that the ETG outperformed the TTG in the takeoff, flight control, landing tasks, and carrier landing tasks. Furthermore, the ETG demonstrated a faster training pace across all tasks. These findings suggest that our independently developed accelerated flight skills training system can effectively expedite motor skill acquisition among flight cadets, enhance flight performance, and holds promising potential for broad application in various flight training contexts.","This study aimed to evaluate the impact of flight simulator training on the enhancement of perceptual-motor skills among flight cadets.

These programs depend on voluntary participation of and reporting by air carrier pilots to be successful. The purpose of the study was to develop and validate a measurement scale to measure U.S. air carrier pilots' perceived benefits and/or barriers to participating in ASAP and LOSA programs. Data from these surveys could be used to make changes to or correct pilot misperceptions of these programs to improve participation and the flow of data. ASAP and LOSA a priori models were developed based on previous research in aviation and healthcare. Sixty thousand ASAP and LOSA paper surveys were sent to 60,000 current U.S. air carrier pilots selected at random from an FAA database of pilot certificates. Two thousand usable ASAP and 1,970 usable LOSA surveys were returned and analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Analysis of the data using confirmatory actor analysis and model generation resulted in a five factor ASAP model (Ease of use, Value, Improve, Trust and Risk) and a five factor LOSA model (Value, Improve, Program Trust, Risk and Management Trust). ASAP and LOSA data were not normally distributed, so bootstrapping was used. While both final models exhibited acceptable fit with approximate fit indices, the exact fit hypothesis and the Bollen-Stine p value indicated possible model mis-specification for both ASAP and LOSA models.","Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and Line Operations Safety Audits (LOSA) are voluntary safety reporting programs developed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to assist air carriers in discovering and fixing threats, errors and undesired aircraft states during normal flights that could result in a serious or fatal accident.

87,2025,Communications Engineering,"Trajectory planning for drone landing, incorporating wind-sensing capabilities, operational and safety objectives, and reinforcement learning","Drone flight safety and operational efficiency are challenged in the landing phase, especially in windy conditions. While flight control should be a key focus, flight trajectory also plays a critical role in landing. Inspired by the multiple objectives, wind sensory capability, and skill learning of avian species, this study proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planner for a drone to perform trajectory planning in the wind, aiming to balance multiple landing-related objectives based on onboard wind sensory capability and address the safety-operational efficiency dilemma of a landing site. Through four key experiments, this study demonstrates successful training, balanced landing performance, and strong generalization capability of the trajectory planner. The experiments highlight the importance of velocity sensory capability while indicating that wind sensory capability is less critical to the trajectory planner. The proposed framework with multiple objectives, wind sensory capability, and skill learning can benefit applications such as improving drone performance.Drone flight safety is challenged in the landing phase, especially in windy conditions.

To address the challenges of trajectory prediction caused by frequent altitude changes in this airspace, we propose ACTrajNet, an altitude-aware trajectory prediction model. The model independently extracts altitude features using temporal convolutional networks(TCN), it then incorporates a channel attention fusion mechanism to dynamically fuse altitude features into the trajectory representation across different channels. This significantly enhances the model’s ability to capture complex vertical flight patterns. ACTrajNet outperforms state-of-the-art models on the TrajAir dataset, achieving up to 2.47% and 2.42% improvement in ADE(Average Displacement Error) and FDE(Final Displacement Error), respectively, compared to the baseline model TrajAirNet.

91,2025,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),Exploring the influence of perceived safety in residential underground car parks on residents’ satisfaction and well-being,"This study finds that the environment of residential underground car parks (RUCP) compliant with design standards does not significantly impact residents’ perceived safety (PS), which carries certain implications. Existing research on RUCP primarily centres on design and air pollution, with limited exploration of their relationship with residents’ well-being (RWB). This study, grounded in the SHEL model, investigates how PS in RUCP impacts residents’ satisfaction (RS) and RWB, thereby addressing a notable gap in the literature. Employing a questionnaire survey, the study collected 282 valid samples and conducted an empirical analysis using structural equation modelling. The evaluation comprehensively examined PS across four dimensions: software (parking management systems), hardware (parking facilities and surveillance equipment), environment (physical surroundings and layout design), and liveware (drivers and managerial staff). The findings reveal that PS does not exert a significant direct effect on RWB but influences it indirectly by enhancing RS. Additionally, environmental factors directly improve RWB but have no significant impact on PS. RS, in turn, has a marked positive effect on RWB. This study innovatively proposes an analytical framework based on the SHEL model, offering theoretical insights and empirical support for optimising the design and management of RUCP to improve overall neighbourhood environments and residents’ quality of life.","This study finds that the environment of residential underground car parks (RUCP) compliant with design standards does not significantly impact residents’ perceived safety (PS), which carries certain implications.

Qualitative findings supported these results, with students reporting higher participation, improved concept recall, and greater enthusiasm. Instructors observed enhanced confidence in applying theoretical knowledge. Despite these benefits, challenges such as internet connectivity issues, time constraints, and question format limitations were identified. The study recommends a blended learning approach integrating gamification with hands-on training, scenario-based exercises, and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.

Both ULR and LR flights are flown with augmented (3 or 4 pilot) crews to allow for in-flight rest. The purpose of this study was to measure the sleep, performance, and subjective sleepiness and fatigue in commercial airline pilots as they flew ULR and LR flight pairings. We compared the amount of sleep obtained, performance on a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), and subjective rating of sleepiness and fatigue in the same pilots during ULR and LR flight pairings. N=74 Boeing 777 pilots were studied continuously during adjacent ULR and LR flight pairings. While controlling for flight duration, there was no significant difference in the amount of in-flight and sleep obtained between ULR and LR flight pairings. After controlling for layover duration, there was no difference in the amount of sleep obtained during layover between ULR and LR flight pairings. Pilots obtained more sleep while away from base during ULR relative to LR pairings, even after controlling for the time away from base. There was no significant difference in reported levels of sleepiness and fatigue during ULR and LR flight pairings. There was no significant difference in PVT speed throughout the flight during ULR and LR flight pairings. Results suggest that ULR flights are not inherently more fatiguing than LR flights despite the longer duty times associated with ULR operations. The methods used can be translated to a data-driven fatigue risk management system.

95,2025,Social Sciences,Wings or Handcuffs? The Dilemmas of Helicopter Parenting Based on a Systematic Literature Review,"Modern parenting styles cover a wide spectrum, from strict tiger parenting to supportive lighthouse parenting. Among these, helicopter parenting remains particularly controversial: while some consider it a protective approach, others believe that excessive control can hinder the development of a child’s autonomy and independence. Our research is significant because it approaches the topic from a rarely examined pedagogical perspective, thereby contributing to the psychology-dominated literature. We conducted our analysis using the EBSCO Discovery Service search engine and followed the steps of the PRISMA protocol. The aim of the study is to explore the relationship between helicopter parenting and academic achievement, as well as to review the factors—such as career-related decisions and adaptation—that may play a mediating role in this relationship. It reviews 33 studies published between 2012 and 2024, most of which use quantitative methods. Most of these studies were conducted in the United States and focus primarily on the college-age demographic. Our findings show that recognising and addressing helicopter parenting behaviours is essential to supporting student success. Furthermore, educational institutions should more actively make use of the potential resources and opportunities offered by such parenting behaviours. Overall, our findings confirm that helicopter parenting remains an under-researched topic at both the national and European levels, particularly in the context of education and public education systems, where further research is clearly needed.","Modern parenting styles cover a wide spectrum, from strict tiger parenting to supportive lighthouse parenting.

Our research is significant because it approaches the topic from a rarely examined pedagogical perspective, thereby contributing to the psychology-dominated literature.</excerpt>"
96,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Naturalistic decision making in aviation: Understanding the decision making process of experienced naval aviators during novel or unexpected situations in flight,"This study examines the decision making process of experienced naval aviators during novel or unexpected situations in flight. Specifically, the study focuses on problems that these aviators encountered and examines what information and strategies were used by these individuals in dealing with their issues. Eleven experienced F/A-18 naval aviators were interviewed using the Critical Decision Method. Data from these interviews was then analyzed in two steps: (a) first, separately for each participant (within-participant analysis); and then (b) across participants (between-participant analysis) in order to identify themes and patterns that emerged. Additionally, two member checks occurred during the study, after each step of data analysis. Findings of the study address the following six areas: (a) the types of problems that arose; (b) how the aviators identified problems as novel or unexpected; (c) how the aviators first identified the existence of a problem; (d) cues and factors that were noticed and considered by the aviators throughout their decision making process; (e) strategies utilized by the aviators; and (f) difficulties that the aviators encountered in selecting and implementing these strategies. Findings of the study are discussed in relation to the literature on decision making, aviation, and human factors. Support is found for Klein's Recognition-Primed Decision model, Orasanu and Fischer's Aviation Decision-Process model, and Endsley's work on situation awareness. Additionally, the findings identify the importance of two contextual factors in the aviation environment that have not been addressed previously: (a) the purpose of the flight (combat versus non-combat); and (b) the flight operation environment (shore-based versus carrier-based). These two factors were found to influence each other in addition to impacting the saliency of certain cues and factors for the aviators. Based on these findings, a model of the Aviator Decision Making Process is developed, thereby contributing to current aviation decision making theory. Implications of the findings for practice are discussed, including the importance of educating aviators on cues and factors that they should be considering in various types of situations, such as when flying off of aircraft carriers or engaging in combat. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also provided.","This study examines the decision making process of experienced naval aviators during novel or unexpected situations in flight.

97,2025,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),ACXNet hybrid deep learning model for cross task mental workload estimation using EEG neural manifolds,"Mental workload is an interdisciplinary construct that significantly influences human performance, particularly in tasks requiring sustained attention and cognitive processing. Effective mental workload assessment is critical for preventing cognitive overload, which can lead to errors and reduced efficiency in high-stakes environments. The approach leverages topographic neural manifolds (spatial electrode arrangements) and temporal neural manifolds (time-series patterns) to capture comprehensive brain activity representations.Traditional methods rely on subjective reports or task performance, but physiological signals like EEG provide a more objective and continuous means of monitoring cognitive states. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid novel approach ACXNet which integrates autoencoder, CNN and XGBoost to learn features of EEG from an individual cross task performance without prior subject-specific calibration or task specific pre-labeled .training data. Utilizing the STEW (Simultaneous Task EEG Workload) dataset, containing recordings from 48 participants experiencing different levels of cognitive demands. Unsupervised feature extraction was carried out using an autoencoder. Subsequently, a CNN was employed to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies in the data, and XGBoost was utilized for efficient mental workload classification. This research adopts a binary classification approach to differentiate between low and high mental workload during SIMKAP and No task. The ACXNet model proposed in this study outperforms the existing methods with an average accuracy of 92.10% for SIMKAP task and 89.94% for No task condition. These findings show that ACXNet significantly improves the robustness and precision of mental workload estimation, providing a scalable solution adaptable to real-world applications, opening new avenues for the development of intelligent systems in human-computer interaction, healthcare, and beyond.","Mental workload is an interdisciplinary construct that significantly influences human performance, particularly in tasks requiring sustained attention and cognitive processing.

98,2024,PQDT - Global,"Psychological Well-Being, Organisational Support, and job Satisfaction in Aviation Professionals in South Africa","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the aviation industry, introducing new stressors for employees. This study examined relationships between psychological wellbeing, organizational support, and job satisfaction among 38 South African aviation professionals during the post-pandemic recovery period. Quantitative survey data was analysed using correlational and multiple regression techniques. Results revealed positive associations between organizational support, psychological wellbeing, and job satisfaction. In the multiple regression model, organizational support emerged as the strongest predictor, explaining over a quarter of variance in job satisfaction (β = .52, p < .001). This highlights its crucial buffering capacity amid acute pressures. Psychological wellbeing also exhibited a robust positive relationship with job satisfaction (β = .43, p < .01), emphasizing the importance of personal resources and positive appraisals for fulfilling work. Together, organizational support and psychological wellbeing significantly predicted job satisfaction, indicating their joint salience. Findings align with the job demands-resources model, with organizational and personal resources helping mitigate pandemic-related demands to sustain satisfaction and performance. Practical implications point to investing in supportive cultures, mental health provisions, and work-life balance policies to alleviate COVID-related strains as aviation companies rebuild.However, limitations including the small sample size warrant caution in generalizing results. Addressing methodological constraints through expanded samples, longitudinal tracking, qualitative data, controlled experiments, and cross-national comparisons offers critical directions for subsequent research on optimizing occupational wellness in aviation during post pandemic transitions.","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the aviation industry, introducing new stressors for employees.

99,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Performing proficiency: Applied experimental psychology and the human engineering of air defense, 1940-1965","During the Second World War, American military strategy depended on servicemen who were proficient users of the sophisticated machines required for air warfare: airplanes, bombsights, antiaircraft artillery, and radar.  Tasked by the US Armed Services to identify men with the requisite traits, experimental and applied psychologists developed rigorous methods for screening and training personnel, as well as techniques for evaluating the design of equipment for its ease of use.  These military-minded psychologists elaborated a new technocratic discourse—a set of assumptions, concepts, and techniques for producing scientific knowledge about human proficiency in operating technological systems—which promised that even the most complex networks of humans and machines could be calibrated to work seamlessly together to achieve unrivaled capabilities.  This dissertation argues that, in spite of their militarized and technophilic motivations, these psychologists did not assume that the ideal human operator would behave like an automaton or a cyborg, but rather they modeled their human subject on the liberal-democratic individual: a discerning, adaptable, and team-oriented decision maker.  As a result, their discourse erected a tension between the affectless cybernetic organism and the creative, coordinative human user of technology—a tension that even now shapes American expectations for how humans should act, and interact, within the increasingly computer-dependent workplaces of industry, finance, the military, and government.    The psychological discourse on human-machine interaction that emerged in World War II shares ideas and strategies with cybernetics, information theory, and operations research, yet it also critiqued these systems sciences for their tendency to elide the ""human factor.""  This critique was most directly articulated within a collection of fields that so far have been largely ignored by historians, fields then variously known as applied experimental psychology, engineering psychology, aviation psychology, and human engineering.  This dissertation traces how these fields of human engineering psychology labored to calibrate the human element in the military's ""man-machine systems"" of air warfare.  It offers three narratives about American psychologists' efforts, during World War II and the early Cold War, to engineer better bomber crews, air defense personnel, and air traffic controllers.  These narratives reveal how the ambitions, conceptual framework, and experimental techniques of human engineering psychology were shaped by the technical and political challenges of finding reliable and accessible measures of human proficiency—i.e., measures of human behavior in relation to mission success—that would satisfy military planners, service personnel, and scientific experts alike.  In pursuing their science of proficiency, human engineering psychologists constructed oppositions between human and machine, information processing and decision making, rigid programming and procedural flexibility, individual-component behavior and system-wide performance that valorized the liberal-democratic human operator over the subservient automaton.  This dissertation casts new light on the epistemic and political stakes of the Cold War's systems sciences by scrutinizing the discourse that underlies the fields of human engineering psychology at mid-century, especially their epistemological concerns regarding validity, reliability and universality in measuring human performance within technological systems.","During the Second World War, American military strategy depended on servicemen who were proficient users of the sophisticated machines required for air warfare: airplanes, bombsights, antiaircraft artillery, and radar.

100,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Cognitive-Model-Driven Pilot Attention for Commercial Airline Scenarios,"Bringing airline pilots to remote locations for evaluation of new software/hardware tools and procedures is an expensive process in terms of both money and time. Estimating the design and outcome of a study to evaluate these new tools can be tricky as there are many new variables for which there is little to no data. However, sometimes even after careful vetting of scenarios in the simulator prior to bringing subject-matter experts into the simulation facility, few to no metrics of statistical significance can be found. While it may be valid that there are no metrics of statistical significance, it is perhaps a missed opportunity to take advantage of the precious time and resources of having a subject-matter expert at the research facility. The research presented in this paper has developed a software tool for simulating a pilot’s visual perception of working in various configurations of cockpits. This may provide researchers insight into what types of scenarios and tactics would be of interest to use with real subject-matter experts. In other words, this should help identify the best use of resources to take advantage of having pilots at the facility and avoid scenarios/procedures that don’t generate data of interest. Another useful possibility with this tool is identifying cockpits that may be inefficiently designed. Instruments that should be grouped together can be easily identified by analyzing the eye-scan pattern of the model with different cockpit-configuration files. The results that this new software-evaluation tool provides have implications for several different evaluations beyond estimating pilot reactions.","Bringing airline pilots to remote locations for evaluation of new software/hardware tools and procedures is an expensive process in terms of both money and time.

103,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Phase of Flight Differences Formed by the Cross Tabulation of Automation Disruption and Pilot Response,"The present-day state of technological development on modern commercial airliners has resulted in aircraft that have most of the customary flying tasks accomplished by automated computer systems.  The problem addressed in this study was the effect of flying automated aircraft on pilot response when automated system anomalies occur.  The purpose of this quantitative, cross tabulation study was to examine archival data acquired from the NASA's online Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) electronic database reported between June 2009 and June 2014 to determine if a significant association existed between commercial aircraft automation disruption themes, the nature of the pilot's response, and the phases of flight.  While there has been significant previous research centering on the degradation of manual piloting skills resulting from operating automated aircraft, no association had been established between automation disruption themes, the nature of pilot response, and the phases of flight.  Establishing this association required two-way contingency table analysis with cross tabulation of the research variables to statistically demonstrate significance and quantification of association.  The decisively chosen participants for this study were derived from automation-related ASRS online database incident reports submitted between June 2009 and June 2014 by commercial airline pilots.  The chi square test for significance of association statistically established a significant association between automation disruption theme and pilot response in during the takeoff phase of flight, x2  (3, N = 560) = 8.65, p < .05, the cruise phase of flight x 2 (3, N = 560) = 8.52, p < .05), and the landing phase of flight x2 (3, N = 560) 8.00, p = <.05.  Additionally, the chi square test for significance of association statistically confirmed a significant association existed between phase of flight groups and the nature of pilot response to automation disruptions x2 (2, N = 560) = 20.03, p < .05.  Detailed analysis of the results quantification demonstrated that there is a need for improved pilot-automation interaction within the commercial aviation community.

104,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The effects of weather recognition training on general aviation pilot situation assessment and tactical decision making when confronted with adverse weather conditions,"Previous general aviation (GA) accident studies showed that decision errors were more associated with fatal GA accidents than other kinds of human errors, and weather related accidents, especially continued visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), remained the major cause of fatal GA accidents. Thus, finding the underlying causes of GA pilots' decision errors and continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions are needed to reduce weather related GA accidents as well as fatal GA accidents.  Causal factors and hypotheses of weather related GA accidents show that knowledge, experience, motivation, and weather information frequently have been referred as causal factors of weather-related GA accidents. Among causal hypotheses, situation assessment and risk assessment hypotheses have been cited frequently as the causes of weather related GA accidents.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of weather recognition training on GA pilots' situation assessment and tactical decision making under gradually aggravating weather conditions. To meet this purpose, WeatherWise and an X-Plane 9 flight simulation program has been used. WeatherWise is a computer based weather training program developed by Wiggins et al. (2000) to improve GA pilot weather-related decision making, and was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for free public use.  Pilot situation assessment is a pilot's understanding of a current flight state, and was evaluated in terms of weather assessment and risk assessment. Weather assessment is the pilot's ability to recognize or estimate the changes in visibility, ceiling, and weather condition. Risk assessment is the understanding of the risks associated with flying in adverse weather conditions, and was measured in terms of risk perception and risk tolerance using the Hazardous Event Scale, personal weather minimums, and the Aviation Safety Attitude Scale. Pilot situation assessment was measured by a post experiment questionnaire.  Pilot tactical decision making is in flight judgment, and was evaluated in terms of decision accuracy and decision confidence. Decision accuracy was evaluated by measuring the distance that a pilot has flown from an optimal divert point to an actual divert point, and the distance a pilot has flown into adverse weather conditions. Decision confidence is the pilot's confidence level in making diverting decisions when the pilot encounters adverse weather, and was measured by subjective rating method.  Findings of the study indicated that the WeatherWise training group exhibited significantly higher weather assessment as measured by ceiling estimation ability and decision accuracy as measured by flown distance into adverse weather condition than the control group, but no significant differences were found in their risk assessment and decision confidence. Although the effects of weather training on the risk assessment were not significantly different between the two groups, participants in the WeatherWise training group was more conservative toward flying into adverse weather condition than the control group.  It was hypothesized to find a positive relationship between pilots' situation assessments and their tactical decision-making because situation assessment forms a basis for decision making; however, positive relationship was found only between pilots' ceiling estimation and flown distances into adverse weather in this study. Thus, it can be concluded that the weather training was effective at least in part to pilot situation assessment and tactical decision making. In addition, considering the weather training was just one-time 30 minute training, long-term effects of weather training should be conducted to find further relationship between pilot situation assessment and tactical decision making.  The results of this study can be expanded not only to GA pilots but also to commercial airline pilots and military pilots for various reasons. First, all pilots are expected to acquire weather recognition skills and knowledge to ensure a safe flight regardless of their flight types because the nature of weather condition changes is dynamic and hard to predict during the flight. Second, although those aircrafts are well equipped with navigation aid systems and weather display radar, they do not provide real–time weather information, and they sometimes malfunction.  In conclusion, it is expected that this study will be helpful for GA pilots to understand the effects of weather recognition training on weather decision making, and eventually help them assess a situation correctly and make a timely in-flight decision. It is believed that this study will help to establish a sound foundation for weather training program and has the potential to reduce weather-related GA accidents by implementing weather training during flight training.","Previous general aviation (GA) accident studies showed that decision errors were more associated with fatal GA accidents than other kinds of human errors, and weather related accidents, especially continued visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), remained the major cause of fatal GA accidents.

107,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"The relationships of metacognition, self -efficacy, and educational and /or flight experience to situation awareness in aviation students","Situation awareness is considered one of the most significant factors affecting the safe operation of general aviation, military, and transport category aircraft. However, SA—as it is called—is at best a cryptic psychological construct. The basis of this research study was rooted in the belief that the identification of related psychological processes and other factors would contribute to the conceptual development of SA as well as add to its theoretical stature. The study was conducted at a North-Central University's College of Aviation. Participants were selected from various programs within the college and at different academic levels. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 consisted of 184 participants who took the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI; Schraw & Dennison, 1994) and the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES; Sherer, Maddux, Mercandante, Prentice-Dunn, Jacobs, & Rogers, 1982). Phase 2 consisted of a subset of participants from Phase 1 of the study (N = 54). Phase 2 participants were administered the WOMBAT (Wondrous Original Method for Basic Awareness Testing)-CS Situation Awareness Stress Tolerance Test (Roscoe & Corl, 1987; Roscoe, Corl, & LaRoche, 1999, 2001). Findings indicated that while there was no association between metacognition and SA or between self-efficacy and SA, there were statistically significant correlations between metacognition and self-efficacy (N = 184, r = .576, p< .001) and between flight hours and SA (N = 54, r = .354,  p< .001). Flight hours also contributed significantly to the variance associated with SA (r2 = .194, adjusted  r2 = .179, p< .001). Based upon these findings the following conclusion were drawn: (a) experience, as defined by flight hours, plays a significant role in measures of situation awareness; (b) WOMBAT provides an approach for pre-testing participants' levels of situation awareness and stress tolerance prior to accumulating flight experience; (c) this study forms a suitable base for explanatory and experimental studies; and (d) the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory and the Self-Efficacy Scale do not appear to be appropriate proxies for situation awareness measurement.","Situation awareness is considered one of the most significant factors affecting the safe operation of general aviation, military, and transport category aircraft.

108,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A cognitive load scale for measuring information management on the general aviation flight deck,"An investigation was undertaken to determine whether a previously derived multidimensional organizational solution could be meaningfully converted into a subjective scale for the measurement of the cognitive load associated with the management of information by pilots in the general aviation cockpit. The investigation was in the form of three major groups of tasks, each of which was performed by a separate group of pilots. The first set of tasks involved reanalyzing the original paired-comparisons data to determine the consistency of the previous multidimensional solution. The second group of tasks was employed to test various components of the three cognitive load dimensions. A third set of tasks compared the two different psychometric models of multiattribute utility theory and conjoint measurement and scaling to determine which model was better utilized by pilots and which model provided a better measure of predictive validity for cognitive load. The re-analysis provided support for the original multidimensional scaling solution. Results from the second set of tasks indicated that pilots were able to use the dimensions meaningfully and somewhat consistently throughout the battery of tasks. Evidence also suggests that the dimensions are not fit well by an additive model because there exists some level of interaction between the three dimensions of flight function, flight action and sample rate. Further study needs to be done to verify the existence of the same dimensions in other studies, to determine the value of deriving the cognitive load scale, to find a proper model on which to base such a scale and to ascertain the proper situations for implementing such a tool in future research endeavors in the area of human factors.","An investigation was undertaken to determine whether a previously derived multidimensional organizational solution could be meaningfully converted into a subjective scale for the measurement of the cognitive load associated with the management of information by pilots in the general aviation cockpit.

109,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Pilot Designed Aircraft Displays in General Aviation: An Exploratory Study and Analysis,"From 2001-2011, the General Aviation (GA) fatal accident rate remained unchanged (Duquette & Dorr, 2014) with an overall stagnant accident rate between 2004 and 2013. The leading cause, loss of control in flight (NTSB, 2015b & 2015c) due to pilot inability to recognize approach to stall/spin conditions (NTSB, 2015b & 2016b). In 2013, there were 1,224 GA accidents in the U.S., accounting for 94% of all U.S. aviation accidents and 90% of all U.S. aviation fatalities that year (NTSB, 2015c). Aviation entails multiple challenges for pilots related to task management, procedural errors, perceptual distortions, and cognitive discrepancies. While machine errors in airplanes have continued to decrease over the years, human error still has not (NTSB, 2013).A preliminary analysis of a PC-based, Garmin G1000 flight deck was conducted with 3 professional pilots. Analyses revealed increased task load, opportunities for distraction, confusing perceptual ques, and hindered cognitive performance. Complex usage problems were deeply ingrained in the functionality of the system, forcing pilots to use fallible work arounds, add unnecessary steps, and memorize knob turns or button pushes.Modern computing now has the potential to free GA cockpit designs from knobs, soft keys, or limited display options. Dynamic digital displays might include changes in instrumentation or menu structuring depending on the phase of flight. Airspeed indicators could increase in size to become more salient during landing, simultaneously highlighting pitch angle on Attitude Indicators and automatically decluttering unnecessary information for landing. Likewise, Angle-of-Attack indicators demonstrate a great safety and performance advantage for pilots (Duquette & Dorr, 2014; NTSB, 2015b & 2016b), an instrument typically found in military platforms and now the Icon A5, light-sport aircraft (Icon, 2016).How does the design of pilots’ environment—the cockpit—further influence their efficiency and effectiveness? To explore the possibilities for small aircraft displays, a participatory design investigation was conducted with 9 qualified instrument pilots. Aviators designed mock cockpits on a PC using pictorial cutouts of analog (e.g., mechanical dials) and digital (e.g., dynamic displays) controls. Data was analyzed qualitatively and compared to similar work. Finally, a template for GA displays was developed based on pilot input.","From 2001-2011, the General Aviation (GA) fatal accident rate remained unchanged (Duquette & Dorr, 2014) with an overall stagnant accident rate between 2004 and 2013.

Identifying unique contributions of any of them is essential, because it leads to a better human error prediction model. Results in this study revealed the influence of a number of contextual factors in prediction of error type frequency. Furthermore, the severity conformance metric (an aircraft proximity index) predicted the frequency of error categories to some extent. The number of aircraft in a sector did not contribute significantly towards the prediction of error categories.","Improving safety by reducing the frequency of operational errors in an air traffic control environment has long been the goal of the FAA.

115,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Examining effects of instrument flight instruction on noninstrument -rated pilots' flight proficiency,"Continued flight from visual weather conditions into conditions of poor visibility is the most prominent cause of fatal aviation weather-related accidents. A quantitative, posttest research design was used to determine if either 30 or 60 minutes of instrument flight instruction would significantly improve a noninstrument-rated pilots ability to control the aircraft after entering adverse weather conditions. Sixty-six noninstrument-rated pilots were selected and randomly assigned to one of three groups. The control group pilots received no instrument flight instruction and were required to complete the simulated experiment flight immediately after the 10 minute familiarization flight. The other pilots received either 30 or 60 minutes of instrument flight instruction and were required to complete the simulated experiment flight immediately after the requisite flight instruction. The data were analyzed using a single factor independent design analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine whether there was a significant difference among the groups' means, and Games-Howell pairwise comparisons tests were used to examine the differences between treatment means. The ANOVA indicated there was a significant overall effect ( p=0.0018). The Games-Howell results indicated no significant difference between the control group and the pilots who received 30 minutes of flight instruction; however, there was a significant difference in the experiment flight times between the control group and the pilots who received 60 minutes of flight instruction (p< .05). The increased pilot proficiency was indicated by the shorter times it took various pilots to complete the experiment flight. The more proficient pilots varied off course less than their less proficient counterparts. The results indicated a recommendation to change the Federal Aviation Regulations to require instrument flight during or between the required biennial flight reviews. That recommendation, if implemented, could possibly reduce the number of weather-related general aviation fatalities. It is recommended further investigation be done to determine the deterioration rate of that proficiency, whether a flight training device is as useful as an actual aircraft, and whether the proficiency gained from 60 minutes of instrument flying practice without the aid of a flight instructor would be as beneficial as 60 minutes of instrument flight instruction.","Continued flight from visual weather conditions into conditions of poor visibility is the most prominent cause of fatal aviation weather-related accidents.

Each participant also rated the scenarios on a series of bipolar scales. Aviators from all groups sorted the scenarios into some similar and some different categories. Greater differences were found in the categorizations made by the two less experienced groups as compared with those of the two more experienced groups. In particular, the less experienced groups' categorizations of scenarios were not as well defined as the those of the two more experienced groups and appeared to focus more on the decision event itself. The categorizations of the two more experienced groups were highly similar to each other and seemed to include considerations beyond the decision event. Specifically, all groups sorted the scenarios in terms of crew coordination/workload and all but the least experienced group also sorted in terms of time/risk. However, the two more experienced groups also considered the impact of the events in each scenario on the overall flight plan. The results of this research confirmed the proposed expectation that there is a change in perceptions of problems from low experience level individuals to those with higher experience.

118,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,High-fidelity weather simulation for improved flight training and investigation of pilots' weather-related decisions,"The mortality rate for accidents involving visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is disproportionately high. ""Over the past ten years, 86% of VFR-into-IMC accidents have been fatal, causing 518 individual deaths"" (AOPA, 2010, p. 18). This creates significant uncertainty about why these accidents happen. Therefore, to better understand the root causes of VFR flight into IMC, the present project explores the current state of the art of flight training.   Accident data show that VFR flight into IMC is partially due to training and experience deficiencies and partially due to misplaced motivation on behalf of pilots (Burian, Orasanu & Hitt, 2000; Goh & Wiegmann, 2002; O'Hare & Owen, 2002). However, laboratory-derived findings of VFR flight into IMC have failed to support prominent psychological theories of decision making (Wiegmann, Goh & O'Hare, 2002). Results of a fine-grained analysis of previous simulation research revealed that this disparity across data sources is primarily due to the fact that current weather simulation is inadequate for training and investigating pilots' weather-related decision skills. Since it would be unsafe to send pilots into actual inclement weather to gain this expertise, high-fidelity weather simulation was developed as a proof of concept to examine this issue. An experiment was conducted in which 16 VFR-only pilots and 16 instrument-rated pilots flew a simulated cross-country flight in marginal VFR weather that encountered IMC. Their procedural performance and demographic variables were analyzed to identify key flight skills and experience-related factors associated with good weather-related decision making.  IMC experience was found to be the only significant demographic factor that promoted proper communication skills such as analyzing in-flight weather reports to support good weather-related decisions during the simulated flight experiment. Total previous flight time and IFR-rating were not significant factors. These findings speak to the high fidelity of the weather simulation utilized in this experiment, and they shed light on the inadequacies of flight training discussed herein that restrict pilots from accessing challenging weather scenarios during training. Results from this study provide empirical support for the deployment of high-fidelity weather simulation for advanced training and investigation of pilots' weather-related decisions.","The mortality rate for accidents involving visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is disproportionately high.

121,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Visual perception in aviation: Glide path performance during impoverished visual conditions,"Research has attempted to identify which visual cues are most salient for glide path (GP) performance during an approach to landing by a pilot flying in both rich and impoverished visual conditions. Numerous aviation accidents have occurred when a shallow GP was induced by a black hole illusion (BHI) or featureless terrain environment during night visual approaches to landing. Identifying the landing surface's orientation as well as size, distance, and depth cues are critical for a safe approach to landing. Twenty pilots accomplished simulated approaches while exposed to manipulated visual cues of horizon, runway length/width (ratio), random terrain objects, and approach lighting system (ALS) configurations. Participants were assessed on their performance relative to a 3 degree GP in terms of precision, bias, and stability in both degrees and altitude deviation over a distance of 5 nm (9.3 km) assessed at equal intervals to landing. Runway ratio and distance from the runway were the most dominant aspects of the visual scene that differentiated pilot performance and mediated other visual cues. The horizon was most influential for the first two-thirds of the approach and random terrain objects influenced the final portion. An ALS commonly used at airports today, mediated by a high runway ratio, induced shallow GPs; however, the worst GP performance regardless of ratio, was a combination ALS consisting of both side and approach lights. Pilot performance suggested a three-phase perceptual process, Assess-Act-React, used by pilots as they accumulated visual cues to guide their behavior. Perceptual learning demonstrated that despite recognition of the BH approach, pilots confidently flew dangerously low but did improve with practice implying that visual spatial disorientation education and training would be effective if accomplished in flight simulators.","Research has attempted to identify which visual cues are most salient for glide path (GP) performance during an approach to landing by a pilot flying in both rich and impoverished visual conditions.

122,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Examining Change in Self-assessments of Decision Making under Stress in a Flight Operations Center Simulator,"This study investigated the prediction of change in perceptions of decision making under stress (DMUS) using measures of personal fear of invalidity, stress, an initial assessment of decision making under stress, and a performance feedback metric. Subjects in this study were participants in a flight operations center simulator, where a team of individuals works together to operate a virtual airline while handling various routine and non-routine issues. An assessment of change in DMUS indicated participants in the simulator training reported increased perceptions of their ability to make decisions under stress after experiencing three flight operations simulations. A test of the model predicting DMUS indicated the only significant predictor of this variable was the initial (pre) assessment of DMUS. Future research should explore other performance-related and individual difference variables that may predict decision making under stress, a skill that is critically important to high-stress and high-pressure work environments.","This study investigated the prediction of change in perceptions of decision making under stress (DMUS) using measures of personal fear of invalidity, stress, an initial assessment of decision making under stress, and a performance feedback metric.

123,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Effective VR: Interplay of presence, perception, fidelity and transfer effects in the development of inspection training simulators","Increased emphasis on aircraft inspection to ensure aviation safety has resulted in the need for a better trained workforce of aircraft maintenance personnel. Aircraft inspection is mostly visual in nature. Thus it has led to the development of computer simulators to train human inspectors performing the inspection task. However, the lack of immersion and interaction in such simulators has led to limited effectiveness and adoption. Using advances in graphics and virtual reality technology, there is an increase the sense of involvement in using these simulators. Though technology is available to provide higher levels of immersion, it is expensive. It is not very clear if the higher fidelity in virtual reality simulators translate to an increase in the effectiveness of training. This research explores the effect of fidelity on presence, perception and performance applied to the development of virtual reality aircraft inspection simulators. Initially, training simulators are developed at varying levels of fidelity using an iterative process evaluating different interfaces. A transfer effects study evaluating the effectiveness of the VR training provided at varying levels of fidelity is conducted. This research compares the performance of VR trained novice inspectors in an actual aircraft inspection task to the performance of novice inspectors receiving traditional classroom training. Eight different implementations of the training simulators derived by combining two levels of graphic realism with four levels of display interfaces are then evaluated on task performance measures, situation awareness and subjective measures of presence and workload.",Increased emphasis on aircraft inspection to ensure aviation safety has resulted in the need for a better trained workforce of aircraft maintenance personnel.

124,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Factors Contributing to Self-Reported Student Pilot Fatigue,"Student pilots are the future of aviation and one of the biggest problems that they face as new pilots is fatigue. The survey was sent out asking if student pilots were fatigued, if they attribute flight training, school work, work outside of school, and social obligations to their sleep loss, and how they spend their time on those activities. The survey was given to aviation students at Arizona State University (ASU) Polytechnic Campus. ASU student pilots were found to be fatigued through a single sample t-test. Other t-tests were done on each of the questions that asked student pilots how flight training, school work, work outside of school and social obligations affect their sleep loss. Flight training and school were found to be contributing to student pilots sleep loss. Work outside of school and social obligations were found to not be contributing to student pilots sleep loss. It was found that student pilots' tendency to use a planner or calendar was found to not be significant. Along with this planning through the week when they will do assignments or study for exams was also not found to be significant. Students making lists of assignments and when they are due was also found to not be significant. The t-test also found that student pilots are neutral on the topic of whether good time management skills would help increase the amount of sleep that they get.","Student pilots are the future of aviation and one of the biggest problems that they face as new pilots is fatigue.

The present study examined pilot performance and risk perception on a localization task using static electronic map displays. Pilot heading and angle of intersection (the angle at which the paths of the pilots' current heading and traffic's heading intersect) were manipulated to determine how they affect how quickly and accurately pilots are able to localize traffic. Pilots were also asked to rate the likelihood that they would collide with traffic on a scale from 1 to 7. Although heading and angle of intersection did have an effect on performance, the results were difficult to interpret, which led to a closer examination of the maps to determine what may have caused such poor performance on several of the maps. A large frequency of distortion errors were found to have occurred, a problem that arose in previous research. As expected, angle of intersection did have a Significant effect on risk perception such that pilots perceived a higher risk of collision as the angle of intersection increased from 0 to 180 degrees.",The continued risk of mid-air collisions coupled with the high expense of advanced cockpit displays drives the need for research that explores the use of current technology in General Aviation cockpits for the purpose of traffic localization.

Furthermore, this study extends previous investigations and contributes to the self-efficacy literature by examining how perceptions of training instrumentality affect the development of self-efficacy. While many studies have investigated the extent to which self-concepts (e.g., self-esteem) and perceptions of performance (e.g., self-evaluation and attributions) affect self-efficacy, they have not examined how perceptions of the training (e.g., instrumentality) affect self-efficacy for post-training performance.Specifically, this study proposed and tested hypotheses regarding the development of self-efficacy for actual task performance based on training performance and cognitive evaluation of training performance. Training performance, prior flight experience, and self-esteem predicted self-efficacy for post-training flight performance.

127,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Policy Violations Predicting Fatal General Aviation Accidents from Visual Flight Rules to Instrument Meteorological Conditions,"Weather is one of the most significant factors affecting general aviation safety.  The associated weather policies that are designed with safety in mind, are some of the most difficult to follow and are the least understood.  This socio–economic problem represents the loss of approximately 100 lives costing insurance companies approximately $600 million dollars yearly in lost aircraft and personnel affecting aviation companies and individuals on the ground.  The problem is that flying into instrument meteorological conditions without a flight plan, proper ratings, currency or medical status, violates established policies and puts safety at risk.  The purpose of this quantitative, ex post facto study was to examine whether policy violations, specifically flight plan, ratings, flight currency, and medical status could predict fatal general aviation accidents flying from visual flight rules to instrument flight rules conditions.  This information assisted in determining if potential training, regulatory modifications, or enforcements are required.  The study evaluated National Transportation Safety Bureau accident investigation data from 1998 to 2013.  The binary logistic regression analysis indicated that Flight Plan violations, Wald statistic = 1.770, df = 1, p = .183, OR = 1.274, 95% CI [.892, 1.819], and Pilot Medical Status violations, Wald statistic = .014, SE = .337, df = 1, p = .905, 95% CI [.496, 1.859] were not statistically significant predictors of Fatality.  The binary logistic regression analysis indicated that Pilot Ratings Violations, Wald statistic = 13.824, SE = .050,  df = 1, p = .000, OR = .832, 95% CI [.755, .917] and Pilot Currency violations, Wald statistic = 15.065, SE = .185,  df = 1, OR = .488, p = .000, 95% CI [.339, .701] were statistically significant predictors of Fatality.  Given that Pilot Rating violations and Pilot Currency violations significantly increase the odds of Fatality, the recommendations included restricting pilots from flying VFR to IMC that are not instrument rated, or who do not have adequate flight time.  Additional recommendations include stronger enforcement of policies, postponing instrument training until the pilot has a minimum of a private pilot certification or requiring that the instrument rating becomes part of a private pilot's certificate.  Recommendations for future research include investigating if multiple violations are likely to occur by the same pilot, and if that further increases the odds of fatality. In addition, future research should investigate if regulation violations are an effective predictor of all fatal accidents regardless of meteorological conditions.","Weather is one of the most significant factors affecting general aviation safety.

128,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Effects of cockpit display of traffic information on visual attention and eye movements in the general aviation cockpit,"A General Aviation pilot must perform primary flight tasks of aviate, navigate, and communicate while attending to information regarding collision avoidance. A cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) has been previously proposed as a form of automation to assist in the latter task. The present study assessed the impact of a CDTI on the performance of a pilot's primary flight tasks. The Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MAT) was used as the primary task. The University students' multi-task performance, and visual sampling strategies with and without the CDTI were assessed. The addition of the CDTI task to the MAT task performance induced a scanning strategy change resulting in improved task performance. There appears to have been a shift from a data acquisition strategy to one emphasizing the frequent sampling of all task displays. However the engine thrust maintenance sub-task was negatively impacted by the addition of the CDTI task. It appears that the overall task demands of the MAT and CDTI together created interference with the memory demands of this sub-task leading to longer periods of time away from the optimal thrust. The effect of expertise on these abilities and strategies were investigated in a second experiment with University students and GA pilots. Expertise played a role in their strategies such that the students who had more MAT experience determined their attention strategy based on the ratio of intruders to total number of CDTI events. In contrast, the number of CDTI events appears to have driven the sampling strategies of the other participants (pilots and a second group of students) who had less experience with the MAT. The results of both experiments indicate the need for the training of an efficient information acquisition strategy particularly when a new display is added to a set of primary task displays. While the CDTI did not negatively affect overall primary task performance, it did alter the attentional strategies of the participants which was beneficial under the data-limited conditions of the first experiment but detrimental under the increased CDTI event rate of the second experiment.","A General Aviation pilot must perform primary flight tasks of aviate, navigate, and communicate while attending to information regarding collision avoidance.

130,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Neurocognitive Predictors of Flight Performance of Successful Solo Flight Students,"Cognitive abilities have been identified as a significant source for determining the potential for individuals to achieve success as pilots. However, while assessments of specific cognitive abilities are considered critical to predicting pilot performance, they do not form part of university admission processes for students applying to flight programs, where attrition rates can be high as 70%. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) three-stratum model theory of cognitive abilities links academic and cognitive performance; however, further research could contribute to stratum modifications by expanding understanding of the relationships between CHC theory information processing abilities and specific human performance. In an independent-sample t test research design, this nonexperimental quantitative study examined the relationship between cognitive predictors and successful solo flight performance of student pilots. The CogScreen Aeromedical Edition neurological assessment was used to determine if cognitive factors are valid and reliable of successful solo flight performance. The study participants were 70 student pilots (a convenience sample) between the ages of 18 and 25, 10 female (14%) and 60 male (86%), selected from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The CogScreen-AE measure was administered to the participants prior to their flight instruction. Flight instructors used the FA121 Flight Training Syllabus to evaluate student performance during their training. At the completion of the training, participants were placed in Solo-Completed (n = 52) and Solo-Not-Completed (n = 18) groups. Independent-sample t tests were used to compare the mean scores between the Solo-Completed and Solo-Not-Completed groups. The test was significant for the three cognitive measures: divided attention t(68) = 3.77, p< .001, speed-working memory t(68) = 6.81, p< .001, and LRPV  t(68) = 17.67, p< .001. The Pearson correlation results revealed that LRPV (r[52] = .32, p< .05) had the strongest relationship of the three cognitive measures. In addition, regression analyses revealed that the LRPV was the most predictive that explained 81% of the variance (R² = .81,  F[1, 51] = 213.15, p < .001) in successful solo flight performance. These findings suggest that these cognitive measures are significant of successful solo flight performance and provide further evidence in support of the CHC theory. It is concluded that applying a cognitive performance measure prior to admission to a flight program may reduce attrition rates, support necessary accommodations, and identify flight deficiencies. Further research should compare results among different university flight programs to confirm the findings and to improve the reliability of the CogScreen-AE as a standardized measure for beginning flight students.","Cognitive abilities have been identified as a significant source for determining the potential for individuals to achieve success as pilots.

People having diverse cultural backgrounds may interpret signage layouts differently with respect to symbols and text. Consequently, dedicated research into signage perception may provide airport administrators with a more informed sense of how to convey appropriate movement and directional information within their terminals. There are many ways to answer the broad question of what signage encourages passengers to move most efficiently through an airport terminal. This study focused on the different ways in which Chinese and American airline passengers navigated through a terminal using either signs showing text only, symbols only, or both text and symbols. Quantitative in nature, the study used a unique computer simulation to generate paths having signage with English text, common symbols, or a combination of both. Participants clicked on arrows to follow the path to the specified goal for each different variation. Total completion time measurements and completion accuracy (in terms of correct versus incorrect clicks) were gathered. Analysis of the results suggested that there was a statistically significant difference related to cultural differences on a passenger's ability to wayfind based on the type of signage used.  Additionally, within cultural groups there was a statistically significant difference as to which arrangements encouraged better wayfinding and those which did not. Lastly, the results suggested a difference in which sign type produced the best wayfinding performance and which sign type people actually preferred.","Processing passengers quickly and efficiently is one of the top goals for airport administrators, and major international gateways have the added challenge of processing passengers representing a variety of cultures and nations.

134,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Public sector pilot perceptions of Flight Operational Quality Assurance programs,"A Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) program monitors pilots by storing hundreds of flight parameters i.e. speed, altitude, instrument readings etc. retrievable for playback. Thus, FOQA is a powerful aviation safety tool, but FOQA has also raised critical data-protection issues regarding its use for disciplinary or FAA actions, and/or release to outside entities for civil or criminal litigation.  The FAA has a strong desire to expand FOQA, however only 17% of smaller air operators have voluntarily adopted it, and little is known about pilot perceptions of FOQA. Technology improvements and cost reductions have enabled its adoption. The General Accountability Office has maintained negative pilot perceptions are a barrier to further adoption of FOQA.   This is the first comparative research to study pilot perceptions of FOQA. This research hypothesized that public sector pilots flying under a FOQA program would have more positive perceptions, and lower negative perceptions, of FOQA than their counterparts not flying under a FOQA program. No significant differences were found on either the positive perceptions scale,  t(185) = .24, p=.81, or the negative perceptions scale t(185)= 1.56, p=.12. A one-way ANOVA indicated that education level did not have a significant relationship with either positive, F(3.178) = .69, p=.56, or negative, F(3.179) = 1.04,  p=.38 , perceptions of FOQA.    It was hypothesized that pilots with FOQA experience would have higher positive perception scale scores, and lower negative perception scale scores, than pilots operating without FOQA experience. The one-tailed point-biserial correlation indicated that there was no significant relationship between positive,  rpb(142) = .09, p= .14, or negative  rpb(142) = -.16, p= .03, perceptions with FOQA experience.   Public sector small air operators operate in a variety of environments that pose risk to safe operations. FAA's promotion of safety data analysis by air operators through voluntary adoption of FOQA has stalled.

135,1997,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Evaluation of perspective and coplanar cockpit displays of traffic information to support hazard awareness in free flight,"A study was conducted to investigate the effects of display dimensionality on the ability of pilots to detect and avoid air traffic conflict in a part-task flight simulation paradigm. Thirty certified flight instructors from the Institute of Aviation at the University of Illinois flew a series of trials using one of three cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) formats. A coplanar (two-panel) format displayed two orthogonal views of the airspace, a conventional top-down view, and a view looking forward from behind the pilot's aircraft which provided a spatial-analog representation of altitude. Two perspective projection formats (one using a 30$\sp\circ$ viewing vector elevation angle, the other using a 60$\sp\circ$ viewing angle) provided integrated exocentric views of the airspace from above and behind the pilot's aircraft. The pilots were instructed to fly to a navigational waypoint displayed on the traffic display, and to deviate from their flight path as necessary to maintain safe separation from conflicting traffic. Traffic approached from a variety of trajectories which were designed to either conflict with, or miss the pilot's aircraft. Results indicated that the coplanar format generally supported better conflict detection and avoidance performance than did the perspective displays. Additionally, the approach trajectory of the traffic interacted with display format to affect the types of maneuvering strategies used by the pilots, as well as their success in avoiding conflicts. The results reported here are contrasted with the findings of previous research which has shown comparative advantages for perspective displays over planar formats which have used alphanumeric and symbolic codes to represent altitude.","A study was conducted to investigate the effects of display dimensionality on the ability of pilots to detect and avoid air traffic conflict in a part-task flight simulation paradigm.

136,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Acknowledgement response and interference timing during the processing of voice and datalink ATC commands,"In aviation, effective communication between air traffic control (ATC) and pilots is critical to pilot performance and safety. Problems and limitations of current radio communications initiated the development of datalink technology. Datalink is a text system used to send messages between ATC and pilots. Although datalink was intended to reduce errors associated with radio communication, there are new concerns related to changes in information processing demands associated with executing speech and text ATC commands. In addition, the nature of responses differs between voice and datalink systems. In a voice environment, responses are immediate. However, time delays exist with datalink. These time delays may create an opportunity for interference. Therefore, the timing of interference and the acknowledgement response on command execution performance were examined during the processing of simulated ATC commands. Verbal and central executive (CE) interference tasks were presented before or after the acknowledgement. Participants received both speech and text commands, responded by a verbal or manual acknowledgement, and set the controls in a flight simulator. Results demonstrated no differences between speech and text formats with a verbal acknowledgement. However, there was an advantage for a manual acknowledgement with longer messages. Regarding interference timing, CE as opposed to verbal interference prior to an acknowledgement had a greater negative effect on control setting performance and the magnitude of this effect was larger in the text condition. Thus, text information appears to be more susceptible to the negative effects of interference as resources begin to reach capacity. However, the differences between the sources of interference decreased with an increase in message length. Therefore, the timing and type of interference can have differential effects on resource capacity and the ability to rehearse information in memory. It was also suggested that the processing code of a task is of more importance than the response code. The findings are interpreted within the context of a working memory and resource perspective and implications are discussed with regard to the communication process in aviation.","In aviation, effective communication between air traffic control (ATC) and pilots is critical to pilot performance and safety.

The study also evaluated the relationship between safety behavior and safety-related events.  Structural equation modeling techniques was used to derive a final measurement model that fit the empirical data and was used to test the study hypotheses. Utilizing a sample of 282 collegiate flight students and instructors from a large public university, a 46-item survey was conducted to measure respondent’s perceptions on the study variables. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 4 top-level management personnel to sample their opinions on the effectiveness of the SMS initiative. Factual safety performance data on the flight program over a six-year period was analyzed to complete a triangulation approach. The results indicate that perceptions of SMS policy implementation have direct, positive effect on safety compliance and SMS process engagement has direct, positive effect on safety participation. Self-efficacy had direct, positive effect on both safety compliance and safety participation. Safety motivation fully mediated the effect of transformational safety leadership on safety participation. Safety-related events did not fully mediate the effect between safety compliance and safety participation. There were indications that respondents were not familiar with the Emergency Response Plan. An ANOVA suggests that certified flight instructors significantly had better safety participation and safety compliance than pre-private pilots did. Senior significantly had better safety participation than juniors. A T-test of mean did not reveal any significant differences in safety participation and safety compliance between respondents with formal SMS training and those without.   A review of factual safety data suggests a positive effect on the safety reporting and safety meeting attendance among respondents due to the SMS initiative. Interviews revealed that top-level management support, resource provision and resilience are key elements in the success of any SMS initiative. The theoretical and policy implications of this study to improve proactive safety in collegiate aviation are discussed.","The study conceptualized Safety Management System (SMS) initiative, self-efficacy, and transformational safety leadership as constructs that relates to safety behavior (measured by safety compliance and safety participation) when mediated by safety motivation using a concurrent-triangulation approach.

Specifically developing a selection system to train and acclimate future pilots while they are in a university setting will not only help select top-tier candidates into the aviation program, but also prepare them for what to expect when they enter the job market. This research study built upon two iterations of a pilot selection battery for a Midwestern university aviation program. Participants completed a battery that was then used for research purposes to obtain information about the potential predictors of pilot performance. The measures include the IPIP Five Factor Scale, Assertive Interpersonal Schema Questionnaire, Cockpit Management Attitudes Questionnaire, Proactive Personality Scale - Short Version, Block Counting Measure, and Rotated Blocks Measure. Additionally, flight instructors evaluated their students based on several aspects of effective performance. Data from 30 student pilots were examined with bivariate correlations and linear regression and the results from the current sample indicated that a pilot personality profile, assertiveness, proactivity, cockpit management skills, and spatial reasoning did not consistently predict flight performance. Further research is warranted to accumulate a larger sample size in order to determine if these characteristics do, indeed, predict performance in the field.","There exists an imbalance between the number of pilots trained to practice in the field of aviation and the amount of those individuals who are qualified to fly airplanes.

139,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,An empirical assessment of situation awareness in an instrument flight rules (IFR) aviation simulation,"Situation awareness (SA) has received much attention from researchers during the past decade. However, many empirical attempts to examine SA are flawed because they rely solely on measures of performance to indicate the presence or absence of SA. This research assumed that SA was a descriptive label for correspondence, a phenomenon that could be defined operationally and examined empirically to determine its relationship to performance. Correspondence was defined operationally as the degree of similarity between the objective significance of a situation and a pilot's mental representation of that situation. Subject-matter experts derived criteria for correspondence and performance using Federal Aviation Regulations to identify the objective significance of several situations embedded within a full-mission aviation simulation. Correspondence was measured empirically by comparing the objective significance of each situation in the simulation (i.e., criteria) with a pilot's mental representation as revealed by responses to knowledge-based questions. T-tests were used to assess correspondence and performance relative to the criteria generated by subject-matter experts. In addition, this research tested whether the level of pilot knowledge, as defined by pilot certification level and amount of actual IFR experience, affected the frequency with which a pilot established correspondence. T-tests were used to assess the hypothesis that pilots with higher knowledge levels [i.e., Certified Flight Instructor-Instruments (CFII)] would demonstrate correspondence more frequently than pilots with lower knowledge levels (non-CFII). Relative to the 13 non-CFII pilots, the 12 CFII pilots established strong correspondence more frequently and they performed better. Measures of correspondence and performance enabled the development and utilization of matrices that were used to analyze the relationship between correspondence and performance. This analysis revealed several instances of dissociation between performance and correspondence, and it challenges the practice of using performance measures solely to infer causality between SA and performance. Furthermore, the correspondence-performance matrices allowed for the categorization of pilot behavior and the derivation of specific solutions to safety-related issues.","Situation awareness (SA) has received much attention from researchers during the past decade.

140,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Deriving pilots' knowledge structures for weather information: An evaluation of elicitation techniques,"Systems that support or require human interaction are generally easier to learn, use, and remember when their organization is consistent with the user's knowledge and experiences (Norman, 1983; Roske-Hofstrand & Paap, 1986). Thus, in order for interface designers to truly design for the user, they must first have a way of deriving a representation of what the user knows about the domain of interest. The current study evaluated three techniques for eliciting knowledge structures for how General Aviation pilots think about weather information. Weather was chosen because of its varying implications for pilots of different levels of experience. Two elicitation techniques (Relationship Judgment and Card Sort) asked pilots to explicitly consider the relationship between 15 weather-related information concepts. The third technique, Prime Recognition Task, used response times and priming to implicitly reflect the strength of relationship between concepts in semantic memory. Techniques were evaluated in terms of pilot performance, conceptual structure validity, and required resources for employment. Validity was assessed in terms of the extent to which each technique identified differences in organization of weather information among pilots of different experience levels. Multidimensional scaling was used to transform proximity data collected by each technique into conceptual structures representing the relationship between concepts.   Results indicated that Card Sort was the technique that most consistently tapped into knowledge structure affected by experience. Only conceptual structures based on Card Sort data were able to be used to both discriminate between pilots of different experience levels and accurately classify experienced pilots as “experienced”. Additionally, Card Sort was the most efficient and effective technique to employ in terms of preparation time, time on task, flexibility, and face validity. The Card Sort provided opportunities for deliberation, revision, and visual feedback that allowed the pilots to engage in a deeper level of processing at which experience may play a stronger role. Relationship Judgment and Prime Recognition Task characteristics (e.g., time pressure, independent judgments) may have motivated pilots to rely on a more shallow or text-based level of processing (i.e., general semantic meaning) that is less affected by experience. Implications for menu structure design and assessment are discussed.","Systems that support or require human interaction are generally easier to learn, use, and remember when their organization is consistent with the user's knowledge and experiences (Norman, 1983; Roske-Hofstrand & Paap, 1986).

Each late stage navy aviator training failure costs the taxpayer over $1,000,000 and ultimately results in decreased operational readiness of the fleet. Currently, potential aviators are selected based on the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), which is a series of multiple-choice tests that evaluate basic and aviation-related knowledge and ability. However, the ASTB does not evaluate a person's response to stress. This is important because operating sophisticated aircraft demands exceptional performance and causes high psychological stress. Some people are more resistant to this type of stress, and consequently better able to cope with the demands of naval aviation, than others.Methodology/Principal Findings Although many psychological studies have examined psychological stress resistance none have taken advantage of the human genome sequence. Here we use high-throughput -omic biology methods and a novel statistical data normalization method to identify plasma proteins associated with human performance under psychological stress. We identified proteins involved in four basic physiological processes: innate immunity, cardiac function, coagulation and plasma lipid physiology.Conclusions/Significance The proteins identified here further elucidate the physiological response to psychological stress and suggest a hypothesis that stress-susceptible pilots may be more prone to shock. This work also provides potential biomarkers for screening humans for capability of superior performance under stress.","Background Attrition of students from aviation training is a serious financial and operational concern for the U.S. Navy.

142,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Supporting multitasking: Evaluation of novel input and output characteristics to support primary and secondary task performance using situation awareness and mental workload,"Driving and flying are examples of tasks in dynamic process control environments where performing secondary tasks poses risks to the user, potentially resulting in detrimental effects on situation awareness (SA) and mental workload (MWL). The predominant theories of multitasking emphasize the potential of using alternate information processing channels to better support multitasking, and hence prompt the exploration of novel interface characteristics that may reduce cognitive and structural interference. This dissertation uses measures of SA and MWL to evaluate the potential of input and output display characteristics found in novel technologies, such as Google Glass, Pebble Smartwatch, and Windows Surface, to support multitasking performance. Three experiments were performed to evaluate the following input and output characteristics: voice input (Experiments 1 and 3), head-up display (Experiment 1), size of display (Experiments 2 and 3), use of discrete tactile signals (Experiment 2), and use of continuously informing tactile signals (Experiment 3). Experiments 1 and 2 altered only interface characteristics associated with secondary task performance, while Experiment 1 also altered interface characteristics associated with primary task performance in the attempt to more effectively redistribute MWL.  While Experiments 1 (Texting and Driving with Google Glass) and 2 (Weather Technology Characteristics in General Aviation Cockpits) indicate the potential SA and MWL benefits of using voice input and larger displays for secondary tasks in multitasking settings, Experiment 3 (Supporting Emergency Vehicle Mobile Command Terminal Use While Driving) sheds light on the limitations of these benefits with increasing task complexity. Experiment 1 showed that combining a head-up display with voice input provided additional marginal SA and MWL benefits. Experiment 2 also suggested SA and MWL benefits when using discrete tactile signals to aid in indicating the need for secondary task attentional shifts. Experiment 3 furthered this exploration of tactile signaling by presenting continuously informing vibrations relating to the primary task, exhibiting both the potential benefits of providing continuous information and the potential drawbacks of overreliance on such displays. These findings have the potential to fundamentally change the way users interact with technology by informing the development of and policies surrounding new products using these features.","Driving and flying are examples of tasks in dynamic process control environments where performing secondary tasks poses risks to the user, potentially resulting in detrimental effects on situation awareness (SA) and mental workload (MWL).

The results suggest that pilots who were high in conscientiousness, self-efficacy, and teamwork competencies perceived their crews to be higher in efficacy and cohesion. However, crew efficacy and cohesion were largely unrelated to crew processes or performance, and these results were not moderated by task-related stress.

Current aviation industry standards for the assignment of personnel to aviation-safety departments vary from company to company.  A person is placed into a safety position by a director of safety or human resources or by a manager of authority.  The problem is the lack of governmental and industry requirements and qualifications for aviation-safety professionals to control risk and prevent accidents.

The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative relationship of core competencies, education, and professional licensing and certification of aviation-safety professionals in commercial and transportation aviation industries.  The non-experimental mixed methods comparative study focused on the criterion variable of core competencies and the predictors of education, professional certification, professional licensing, and the skills and abilities necessary to function as an aviation-safety professional.

146,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The company as family: Perceived strengths of Duncan Aviation,"In contemporary American society, the boundaries between public and private life are blurring. Both work and non-work domains are now expected to provide psychological and emotional support. These heightened expectations of the workplace emphasize the increasing need for business organizations to have positive and supportive work environments. To identify how positive organizational culture is created and sustained, a qualitative case study of Duncan Aviation, Inc., the largest privately-held business-aircraft service company in North America was conducted. The study considers mutually interacting situated practices, organizational structure, communication and leadership styles that lie at the core of organization analysis. The study connects with the historical, social and organizational dynamics to identify how to strengthen, change, and influence culture. A systemic, quantum worldview is used as the orienting theoretical framework—recognizing dynamic, self-organizing, interdependent, and interconnected processes—where the role of the observer is crucial. In contrast, Duncan Aviation thrives in an industry that values and relies heavily on a mechanistic, classic worldview of fundamental building blocks and linear cause and effect. The researcher/author, a 19-year employee of the company, interviewed a cross-section of employees. Cultural characteristics, values and attitudes, and the family atmosphere experienced by Duncan Aviation's employees are identified and described. Factors that influence and contribute to this culture include the founder, the company's 44-year history, the aviation industry, the general business world, the employees, training programs, and company leaders. Findings reveal that the characteristics of Duncan Aviation are closely related to those found in strong families, indicating that a company can function as a family for its members. The work culture promotes cohesion, flexibility, and open communication—characteristics found in strong families—and enhance personal well-being. The focus on caring about people makes the boundaries and differences between work organizations and families more diffused and less important than the people involved and their relationships. Five other contemporary companies known for their positive cultures are reviewed. Their similarities with Duncan Aviation support the premise that companies can create environments that serve and function as supportive families.","In contemporary American society, the boundaries between public and private life are blurring.

This effort has fostered a learning culture in the industry, moving many carriers toward becoming a high reliability organization (HRO). A core HRO characteristic is a preoccupation with detecting conditions leading to system failure. The Federal Aviation Administration, in partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, established the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) to provide a vehicle for personnel to self-report safety concerns. This study examined 361 ASRS cases voluntarily reported by maintainers from 2002 to 2007. The Human Factors Analysis Classification System-Maintenance Extension (HFACS-ME) was used to code conditions that can precipitate failures in pre- and postflight servicing, planned maintenance, and unplanned maintenance. The findings identified 4 specific latent conditions, or 15% of those provided by HFACS-ME, that can affect maintenance: adverse mental state, inadequate training or preparation, inadequate communication, and inadequate assertiveness. The results showed how these four conditions make up 66% of the factors influencing error on the flight line. These results may be used for commercial aviation maintenance to increase maintainer awareness of conditions leading to maintenance error. This awareness can promote the safety refinement of specific human intervention patterns through self-realization by line maintenance personnel. Implications for positive social change include improving workforce awareness of latent conditions that could lead to improved commercial aviation safety.","Since World War II, commercial aviation, in partnership with aircraft manufacturers and regulatory agencies, has endeavored to promote safety by increasing system reliability.

149,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Effects of online training on aircrew monitoring behaviors: A field study,"Data from aircraft accidents and line observation studies indicate that inadequate pilot monitoring is a growing safety concern. In the cockpit environment, pilots who fail to properly manage their workload commit more monitoring errors. Given the lack of training and educational programs available to pilots which emphasize improving their monitoring skills, more research is needed to assess the usefulness of types of training that can be used to improve pilots' monitoring. This research project sets out to determine if the potential exists to enhance pilots' monitoring skills through online training. For this study, 40 military helicopter pilots (participants) were divided into two training groups: (1) an online training group, which completed a 20-minute web-based training module, and (2) a control group, which read a 20-minute article on aviation safety. Within each group, the pilots were paired and completed two training events in a flight simulator as part of their normal duties. The effects of the training were evaluated using Kirkpatrick's multi-level framework: reactions, learning, behaviors, and results. First, all pilots receiving training were surveyed to capture the trainees' perceptions of satisfaction and utility of the training. Second, all pilots were given a multiple-choice test to assess the effect the training had on learners' knowledge of the training objectives. Next, the researchers observed, via video recording, both groups' behaviors during flight simulator events. The researchers recorded occurrences of four behavior markers as the crews flew multiple instrument approaches. The researchers used two of these markers to study transfer of training and two markers to examine positive vs. negative outcomes at critical tasks during the simulated flights. The results show positive changes in the reactions, learning, and behavior dimensions, lending support to the effectiveness of relatively inexpensive online training to teach monitoring skills.","Data from aircraft accidents and line observation studies indicate that inadequate pilot monitoring is a growing safety concern.

150,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"A longitudinal model of social amplification of commercial aviation risks: Exploring United States news media attention to fatal accidents and media effects on air travel behavior, 1978–2001","This dissertation addresses two questions: what determines U.S. news media coverage of fatal airplane accidents, and what is the effect of coverage and of media representations on the number of passengers who fly. It builds on theories of risk and theories of media effects integrating the concept of signal value and exploring how the news media react to a class of risks and generate processes of social amplification of risks in the population. Analyses combined content analyses of the amount and nature of Associated Press (AP) and television coverage of fatal accidents with government data about accidents and enplanements over the period from 1978 to August 2001. Findings suggest that news media attention to fatal accidents is a function of signal value components. Fatalities, carrier type, accident location, the intensity of media representations of accidents as air terrorism, and as mysterious, as well as the density of past accidents—generate coverage independently, but also in complex interactions. Fatalities is the strongest predictor of coverage. The full models accounted for 70% and 62% of the variance in AP and television news coverage, respectively. Some components—fatalities, carrier type, and representations of air terrorism—reinforce each other, generating spiraling amplification in coverage. Regarding the issue of time-concentrated reactions to risks, accidents occurring in periods dense in accidents have a higher likelihood of being selected for television coverage. However, they reduce the positive effect of fatalities and of links to air terrorism on coverage, perhaps because of disaster fatigue or competition for a limited news hole among the accidents covered. Addressing the media effects question, time-series analyses produced some evidence that air travel behavior responds inversely to the volume of media coverage. Media influence is non-linear: behavior tracks coverage inversely only after a threshold is reached and levels off at high levels of coverage. Furthermore, coverage effects are also contingent on monthly fatalities, density of accidents and media representations of accidents as the result of air terrorism. The latter interaction strengthens claims about a media effect on behavior resulting from the combined effect of volume of coverage and media representations.","This dissertation addresses two questions: what determines U.S. news media coverage of fatal airplane accidents, and what is the effect of coverage and of media representations on the number of passengers who fly.

Utility analysis is ordinarily used to estimate the dollar value of implementing one hiring procedure over a previous hiring procedure with a lower validity. Utility analysis can also be extended to situations in which workforce productivity changes as a result of an organizational intervention. In the present study utility methods were applied to an organizational change within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that attempted to improve the workflow of aviation safety inspectors. The On-line Aviation Safety Inspection System (OASIS) allows FAA safety inspectors to log inspections using portable computers.The study estimated potential timesaving in dollars after the workflow change. Three utility estimation procedures were compared for the case in which there was data on timesaving as a result of the workflow change. One of the methods was a commonly accepted procedure that used a literature-based rule to estimate a scaling factor for the conversion of job performance to a dollar metric. The other two methods calculated the financial value of saved labor cost using parameters estimated by a sample of job incumbents.All three methods of estimation converged toward similar values of total benefit. An examination of the error variances of the estimates led to the conclusion that when estimates of timesaving are made one should calculate values for utility using multiple methods to avoid relying on information from parameters that might be unstable.,Utility analysis is a special case of cost-benefit analysis in which the targeted benefit is an improvement in work performance.

152,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The effect of spectrally selective filters on color perception and aviation performance,"Color vision is within ourselves as well as the environment. Color vision is of extreme importance to pilots and in other occupations that require excellent color discrimination. Advancements in laser technology, however, have required the need for laser eye protection. Laser eye protection alters the spectral world that pilots and other professionals must work in. Understanding the effects of these alterations is necessary to prevent mishaps and further applied color vision knowledge. The present study experimentally manipulated the spectral environment and aviation tasks faced by military pilots. Several spectrally selective filters were used to modify the spectral environment. Subjects performed a wide and inclusive range of color vision and aviation tasks with the filters. The effects of these filters on color vision were modeled after current theories of color processing. The predicted results were compared with the actual results. It was found that color vision is both enhanced and decreased by spectrally selective filters, with certain filters safety is compromised when pilots are distracted, and computational modeling may offer predictive benefits in understanding filter and vision interactions. This research contributes to both applied and basic theories regarding the complex relationship between color vision, filters, and aviation.","Color vision is within ourselves as well as the environment.

153,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Effects of interdisciplinary high fidelity simulations: A look at initial industry success in aviation,"This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of interdisciplinary team training for aviation students at the collegiate level.  As it stands, students in the aviation program are trained in academic silos creating a lack of a shared mental model between team members of different disciplines.  Without a shared mental model, students in various disciplines are unaware of other’s knowledge and abilities related to their own.  This proves problematic once on the job, where aviation students are required to work in teams consisting of members from all disciplines (Swan, Scarbrough, & Newell, 2010).  With little to no prior training in teamwork between specializations, newly hired aviation employees may lack the interpositional knowledge, and teamwork skills, and abilities to perform adequately.  In order to address this need for teamwork training in the aviation industry, a NASA funded high fidelity flight operation center unified system (FOCUS Lab) was developed to aid in developing aviation students’ teamwork skills.  The FOCUS Lab simulates the environment in an airline’s Flight Operations Center.  While studies show that participants of the FOCUS Lab like the training and are learning and improving across simulations despite the increasing difficulty level (Littlepage et al., 2013; Littlepage, Hein, Moffett, Craig, & Georgiou, 2015), there has not been a study looking to see if these skills transfer beyond the simulation.  The purpose of the FOCUS Lab is to better prepare students for the workforce; however, if the skills do not transfer, then we cannot truly verify the success of the FOCUS Lab.  The Research Question for this study was what are the effects of high fidelity simulation training on initial employment experiences?  Participants consisted of aviation graduates from a large Southeastern University.  Additionally, as a control group Industrial and Organizational Psychology graduates were contacted as well.  Seven-hundred and three participants were contacted via e-mail and asked to complete an online Qualitrics quiz.  Results from the survey suggested that those graduating from the FOCUS Lab had lower turnover intentions and demonstrated more adequate teamwork skills in interdependent work settings.  Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.","This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of interdisciplinary team training for aviation students at the collegiate level.

The intent of such displays is to assist operators in not only following operational procedures, but also in comprehending the context of the procedures, enabling them to understand why, when, and how to deviate from the procedures if necessary. The results of the dissertation research show that the addition of procedure context increases situation awareness and reduces procedure-following errors, which has been shown to be a significant causative factor for accidents in aviation and other domains. In addition, a pilot's ability to comprehend noncompliance appears to be limited, despite their interest in (and ability to) detect noncompliance. Pilots do not appear be able to interpret the consequences of that noncompliance, suggesting that the design of displays and procedures should assist them in doing so. The results also demonstrate that pilots attempted to use procedure information even when clearly outside the scope of the procedure. This means that procedures and procedure-support aids should consider operation outside of its normal bounds in their design, rather than only for nominal operation as is currently the case.","This dissertation provides evidence that information displays to support procedure following can aid performance and increase situational awareness and safety.

155,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The Creation and Validation of a Pilot Selection System for a Midwestern University Aviation Department,"The current study outlines an attempt to create a selection test for a Midwestern university aviation department pilot training program. Thirty-seven pilots were given a pre-test consisting of cognitive (math, arithmetic reasoning, spatial measures, table reading, and mechanical knowledge), attitudinal (cockpit management attitudes questionnaire - CMAQ), and personality questions (IPIP items, Achievement-Striving, Impatience/Irritability, and the Academic Motivation Scale). An additional measure of professionalism was collected during the training program. Following the completion of a 25-lesson course in flight training, pilots were assessed on performance throughout the initial flight course. The performance ratings ranged from supervisory ratings to hours used to complete the lessons. Though the main research question was largely exploratory in nature, five specific hypotheses are outlined in the paper. Correlation analyses and both curvilinear and linear regression analyses were run in order to assess any significant relationships between the pre-test and flight performance in the program. Results indicated several positive relationships, namely between motivation, hours taken to complete the lessons, and overall performance, as well as a measure of professionalism and overall performance. Limitations and implications are discussed in the paper.","The current study outlines an attempt to create a selection test for a Midwestern university aviation department pilot training program.

The study was primarily focused on the current Part 121 pilots in the United States. The study was designed with a correlational methodology and multiple linear regression was employed as the statistical procedure to analyze the data collected from diverse sources. The sample of the study consists of 163 participants (33 females), and all of them currently working for either major or regional airline in the United States respectively. Simultaneous regression strategy was used to regress all 22 predictors with the outcome variables to generate significant results. The predictors were age, experience in flight hours, education, gender, race/ethnicity, organizational culture, workload, type of airline, current role, job satisfaction, months to upgrade from first officer to captain, years of service employed at current airline, total years of service as an Airline Transport Pilot, salary, marital status, level of spousal income, time away from spouse, number of dependent children, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, medical certification, and fatigue. The outcome variable was pilots’ likelihood to quit flying in Part 121 commercial aviation. Due to the presence of missing data points, multiple imputation was employed as the missing data handling procedure to generate complete datasets. The results of this study suggested that job satisfaction, annual salary before taxes, married vs cohabiting comparison, and medical certification significantly predict pilots’ likelihood to quit flying in Part 121 commercial aviation.

157,2022,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Aviation Stress Management: An Effective Solution to Student Success,"Student success in higher education is being challenged by students’ inability to properly manage stress. The problem to be addressed in this study is that while college students generally experience high-stress levels, university aviation college students have unusually high-stress levels. The purpose of this quantitative non-experimental single group pre-test post-test study was to examine the effectiveness of an aviation stress management course in reducing students’ perceived stress levels and to examine the impacts across age, gender, race, and year in school at a small private aviation university in Northern Arizona. The Yerkes-Dodson law and the cognitive appraisal model are two theoretical frameworks that tie together the relationships between student stress, academic performance, and success. A non-experimental quantitative research method, coupled with a single-group pretest-posttest design was used to sample 63 aviation students who had previously taken an aviation stress management course. Secondary historical data was collected on students’ perceived stress levels before to and after taking the aviation stress management course. The research questions pertained to exploring impacts an aviation stress management course had on student perceived stress levels, and student perceived stress levels across age, gender, race, and year in school. The results indicated a significant reduction in student perceived stress levels based on the pretest-posttest results. Additionally, female students had significantly higher stress levels compared to male students, however, there were non-significant results across age gender, race, and year in school.

158,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Age-related changes in pilot human performance variables contributing to general aviation accidents,"The problem addressed in this causal-comparative study was to investigate the relationship between the 35-39 and 40-44 age groups in the contribution of pilot human performance variables to 1992, 1993, and 1994 general aviation accidents. This research attempted to narrow the focus of where, within the active pilot population, to look for some of the factors that may be associated with an age-related increase in the risk of becoming involved in a general aviation accident. Data were formally analyzed through use of a two-group discriminant analysis. The dependent (criterion) variable was age. The independent (classification) variables were twelve pilot human performance variables in three divisions of the cognitive system: information processing variables attention/ distraction, memory/forgetfulness, judgment/decision making, and communication; psychological variables habits, motivation, fear/panic, complacency, and personality; and skills/training variables training, experience, and currency. The source of data for this study was National Transportation Safety Board Brief of Accident and Factual Reports for calendar years 1992, 1993, and 1994.Examination of the data revealed that the 35-39 and 40-44 age groups were more alike than they were different in the contribution of the pilot human performance variables to the general aviation accidents studied. The discriminant function was not found to be statistically significant, indicating that the age groups studied in this analysis did not differ significantly on the pilot human performance variables. In sum, none of the pilot human performance variables were determined to be significant in predicting membership in either age group of accident-involved pilots. Because no significant relationships were discovered, the researcher failed to reject all null hypotheses. The conclusion was that the pilot human performance variables examined in this study did not significantly differentiate between the 35-39 and 40-44 age groups of accident-involved pilots.

161,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A mixed method approach to collegiate aviation self-assessment of G-load on landing: Pilot perception versus reality,"Because there is no universal definition of a hard landing, pilots themselves must determine if a landing was hard enough to require an unscheduled maintenance inspection. Large, transport category aircraft are equipped with flight data monitoring (FDM) as a secondary data source that can help pilots determine if a hard landing occurred, but FDM is not commonplace in general aviation. It is important for a pilot to be able to differentiate between a firm landing that does not cause damage to the aircraft and hard landing that potentially could cause damage to the aircraft by means of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive cues. Self-assessment of these cues helps pilots determine if the landing should be considered a hard landing. Self-assessments are subjective and depending upon metacognitive level, a pilot may fall prey to self-serving bias.  To determine if self-serving bias is present in the aviation domain, participants completed a survey on landing perceptions. Additionally, flight data monitoring equipment provided actual landing data. Results suggest that self-serving bias is not common in the aviation domain unlike existing literature suggests. Many participants were unable to accurately perceive landing G-load, indicating that FDM equipment provides reliable data.","Because there is no universal definition of a hard landing, pilots themselves must determine if a landing was hard enough to require an unscheduled maintenance inspection.

162,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The effects of different levels of high fidelity simulation on teamwork in senior-level undergraduate aviation students,"Industries in which effective teamwork is critical for safe operations are quickly discovering the benefits of simulation-based training (SBT). Research has shown the aviation industry, military operations, and medical field utilize impressive simulations allowing people to refine their technical and nontechnical skills in a ""no consequence"" environment. Grounded in team cognitive and group dynamic research, researchers are focusing their efforts on how to effectively use simulation as a training tool. The focus of this study was to determine how the degree of simulation difficulty affects teamwork. With a unique high fidelity simulation lab, the participants completed 3 hour work shifts to a run a simulated regional airline. Teamwork was based on the following five variables: contributing to teamwork, interacting with the team, keeping the team on track, expecting quality, and having the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's). The experimental design consisted of three teams randomly assigned to either a minimal, moderate, or maximum level of difficulty. After completion of the simulation, the participants completed an online survey for evaluations of their performance. The findings suggest some components of teamwork are affected by the design of the simulation, while others are not as susceptible to its effects. It was discovered the level of difficulty significantly affected individual and group performance in their expectation of quality and having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's).

Each one of the participants of the aviation industry go through some sort of stress that can test them mentally as well as physically. In this thesis, the focus is on cabin crew who often go unnoticed in many studies. The primary goal of this thesis is to understand what the levels of stress faced by cabin crew are at Emirates Airlines. A triangulation research method was used to obtain the data. For quantitative results a stress survey was used, which included specific stress factors to evaluate the participants’ level of stress. A qualitative approach was also used, with interviews of cabin crew being conducted. The results of the study indicated high levels of stress among Emirates Airlines cabin crew with rostering procedures indicated as one area that particularly causes stress.","Mental health is a very important topic in today’s day and age.

164,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Experimental analysis of task prioritization training for a group of university flight technology students,"Task prioritization performance was evaluated for pilots who participated in a concurrent task management (CTM) training course and pilots who did not. CTM is the process by which pilots selectively attend to high priority tasks and shed non-priority tasks. Twenty seven pilots enrolled in a university flight technology program were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Pilots flew pretest and posttest simulated flights on an FAA approved flight training device (FTD). Twenty potential task prioritization errors were embedded at 14 locations within the flight scenarios. Pretest CTM performance of the two groups was comparable. During a two week period between pretest and posttest simulated flights pilots in the experimental group participated in a CTM training course designed and taught by an FAA certified flight instructor and pilots in the control group did not. A Mann-Whitney U test rejected the null hypothesis that there was no difference in posttest CTM errors between the groups, indicating a positive training effect for experimental group pilots. Longer term training effects were not evaluated. Different cognitive processing models described various pilot behaviors; some behaviors were described by single channel theory, some by single resource theory, and others by multiple resource theory. Mispriotization due to the interruption of an aviate task by a communicate task occurred more frequently than interruption of a navigate task by a communicate task. Fixation on the GPS navigational system caused more than half the pilots to deviate from primary aviate tasks to attend to the secondary navigate task. Additional research with different participants is recommended. A study comparing training results between pilots who have different training backgrounds is also recommended. A longer time period between pretest and posttest and/or a longitudinal study is recommended to test for longer term training effects. Qualitative studies could also be used to enhance experiments, such as gathering responses from participants to discern the extent of their learning. Further studies using cockpits with higher levels of automation and complexity, such as new generation flat panel or 3D cockpit displays is recommended.",Task prioritization performance was evaluated for pilots who participated in a concurrent task management (CTM) training course and pilots who did not.

165,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Underperformance During Crisis Decision-Making Situations: A Qualitative Theory on the Role Distractions Play in Pilot Performance,"Aviation accidents are pervasive and ubiquitous enough that they transcend the boundaries of all aviation organizations—general, corporate, commercial, and military organizations. All aviation bodies have experienced loss of life and total destruction of aircraft during their respective operations. Historical research indicates that some pilots make egregious errors (Bisignani, 2010; NTSB, 2010; Boeing, 2009) when they do not complete checklists and ultimately deviate from normal procedural practices during high-stress events.  Why otherwise competent and qualified pilots make these kinds of egregious errors is elusive and has escaped the grasp of quantitative researcher understanding. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews so pilots could tell their stories and share their perspectives on why they had to repeat a simulator evaluation checkride. Through the lenses of the pilots' perspectives, the pilots' voices established a database from which data were coded, compared, categorized, further coded, and analyzed using grounded theory methodologies as espoused by Corbin and Strauss (2008). Qualitative analysis generated substantive theory grounded in the data. Two conceptual models are presented to support the substantive theory. The substantive theory indicates that pilots can become so distracted by abnormal and nonstandard events that their awareness of what needs to be done next is overshadowed by those distractions. In other words, pilots lose their situational awareness and engage in non-standard activities that result in process errors. Pilots must learn distraction mitigation strategies to maintain their focus and avoid becoming overtasked. This theory is presumed to be transferable to other high-stress professions.","Aviation accidents are pervasive and ubiquitous enough that they transcend the boundaries of all aviation organizations—general, corporate, commercial, and military organizations.

This work was undertaken to seek to better understand why such attempts have not provided real improvement in the overall labor management situation in air traffic. Its overall purpose is to offer a means by which to eventually transform the current deterministic system of the FAA, to a purposive or heuristic one. More specifically, this research approach: (1) examined the nature and the behavior of deterministic systems, (2) proposed an alternative methodological approach to the standard empirical one currently used in studying organizations, (3) explored the reasons why bureaucratic systems, such as the FAA, resist fundamental changes that are necessary for their continuing existence, and (4) contemplated historical and organizational consciousness issues that help to articulate desired approaches to the design of the future of the air traffic system.","Over the last thirty years, increasing numbers of air traffic control employees in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have suffered serious alienation from their employer due to their perception of the autocratic and authoritarian nature of it as a Federal entity.

There have been many incidents and accidents as a result of these challenges to human performance. In previous studies pilots have admitted to performing non-flight related activities in order to deal with these challenges. However, no research has been done on the frequency and perceived safety effects of non-flight related activities. If pilots are engaging in activities intended to counter these challenges, it is important to know the frequency and how pilots feel these non-flight activities affect safety.    This study used a survey tool to gather information regarding non-flight related activities from airline pilots in the United States. Participants provided data on frequency of non-flight related activities, perceptions of their safety effects, opinions on the activities related to automation complacency, boredom, and fatigue, and general information on the positive and negative outcomes of these activities. Results suggest that pilots routinely engage in non-flight related activities during cruise flight and perceive most of the activities to be safe. In addition, pilots believe that these activities help to prevent boredom, which then helps to prevent automation complacency and fatigue. Pilots seem to understand that these activities can have negative safety implications, but overall have more positive outcomes.","Automation complacency, boredom, and fatigue pose significant risk to aviation.

During a flight, a pilot samples multiple displays for information about the task at hand. It is imperative that the changes in the displays are being correctly viewed by pilots to ensure a safe flight. However, it is unknown how much change blindness affects pilots or if pilot expertise plays a role in change detection. A change blindness experiment was performed with twenty four participants divided into two groups based on expertise. Expert pilots were defined as instructor pilots with an average of 952 flight hours and novice pilots were student pilots with an average of 80 flight hours. There were a total of 24 images that were presented to participants during a flicker paradigm that was used to induce change blindness and assess change detection within cockpit instruments by the pilots. Images were static depictions of the primary cockpit displays. Results showed that there were no significant differences between expert pilots and novice pilots when detecting change in displays. The results did show that there was significant difference in location display. It was found that the ADI was the most commonly viewed display with other instruments slower in terms of detection. No difference was found for accuracy in all cases. Results indicate that future research is still needed in change blindness and aviation domain.","Change blindness is a phenomenon where the viewer fails to detect change in an object or scene during a visual disturbance.

These tasks are static in that problems do not change while the student is trying to solve them. Dynamic tasks such as flying, where the problem changes spontaneously over time, represent different challenges for tutors. To understand tutoring in dynamic tasks, we conducted a field observation of students being given messages by a flight instructor. Five low flight time student pilots were asked to perform nine instrument flight tasks while being tutored by an instructor pilot in both a virtual simulator flight and in a real airplane flight. The data from our study were compared to two prominent models of one-on-one tutoring. Only a small portion of the utterances made by the tutor or by the student matched previous accounts, suggesting that a new approach is needed to address tutoring during instrument flight instruction.","Individual tutoring has been successful in facilitating learning in domains such as LISP, physics, and algebra.

171,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Experience and automation effects on failure detection,"The information available to pilots in traditional aircraft is also present in modern aircraft, however, the information may not be utilized in the same way. As pilots gain experience with the information provided in modern cockpits, they selectively adjust their attentional focus. Information that is redundant to primary information, but easier to use, results in the primary information seldom being sampled, for example relying on the flight director to the exclusion of the glideslope and localizer.A task created for these studies required subjects to perform a tracking task and report anomalies in a set of redundant cues. Subjects moved a cursor up a screen passing through the horizontal midpoint of eight pairs of squares. An additional pair of more closely spaced dots marked this midpoint accurately for the first 200 trials. On 10% of the next 200 trials the dots were offset (left or right) from the center of the squares. These studies examined the reliance on the easier-to-use dots. It was shown that subjects perform poorly in the detection of an offset of the dots, when this information has proved to be reliable. The redundancy that is designed into the system and is required to be used is actually ignored.The long-standing finding in the vigilance literature is that operators typically change their decision criteria over time. This change results in a reduced probability of signal detection. With this task, after experience without a failure subjects had the same decision criterion, yet were less likely to detect the failure due to omitting the check for the presence of an offset.The reliance on the more easily used information was examined in automated and manual control conditions. The findings show that with adequate feedback and low workload, automated control does not degrade nor contribute to failure detection.These findings have critical implications for flight deck design, pilot training, and testing. The implications are discussed and suggestions are offered to improve failure detection.","The information available to pilots in traditional aircraft is also present in modern aircraft, however, the information may not be utilized in the same way.

At The University (TU), a southern university specializing in aviation and aerospace, students are required to adhere to strict alcohol policies, according to Federal Aviation Administration guidelines. TU has limited statistics examining frequency of substance use and perceptions of students. A simple descriptive survey design was utilized to identify use patterns and perceptions among TU students and compare this data to national averages. Using a probability-based simple random sampling strategy, 1,500 students were selected to complete the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey, a web-based survey. 205 surveys were received. Patterns of use at TU demonstrated differences from national norms. Overall alcohol and marijuana use frequency at TU was less than use patterns nationally. Most TU students in the sample reported never having used marijuana, an abstinence rate much higher than reported nationally. Other drug use did not differ from the national sample. Differences were noted between groups, with fraternity members reporting and being perceived as having the highest frequency and amount of alcohol use. Higher alcohol use amounts were reported at fraternity social functions than other locations. However, Greek students reported less marijuana use than other groups and all denied ever using other illicit drugs. TU students residing off-campus self-reported and were perceived as having higher alcohol and marijuana use than on-campus students. It was perceived that males drink at a higher frequency than females, and that males consume more drinks. Yet, females showed greater range of other drug use. TU student athletes did not report alcohol use higher than average. While current pilots reported alcohol use at higher frequency than pilots-in-training, pilots-in-training reported consuming more drinks per setting than current pilots, and greater frequency of binge drinking. Non-pilots reported the lowest alcohol use and binge drinking. The reverse was observed for marijuana: non-pilots as well as pilots-in-training reported the highest range of use. All current pilots reported never using marijuana. Non-pilots reported the highest range of other drug use, followed by pilots-in-training and current pilots.","Alcohol and drug use by college students has reached alarming prevalence and causes consequences in many areas of life functioning.

In the current environment of dwindling resources, funding for experiments requiring large sample sizes, a normal requirement for between-group designs, is becoming difficult to find. However, the need to improve safety within the aviation industry is an ongoing requirement, especially as advances in technology continue have an impact on how the industry operates. SCDs are experimental designs that require very few participants and therefore have the potential to save time and associated costs.The first paper reviews published articles in three prominent journals to determine the types of experimental and quasi-experimental designs commonly used in applied aviation research and to compute a post hoc statistical power analysis for each experiment. The review shows that between-group experimental and quasi-experimental designs dominated applied aviation research and most designs lacked statistical power to detect medium and small effect sizes. SCDs were introduced as efficient alternative designs for many applied aviation studies.The objective of the second paper is to examine if the results from an SCD produced similar findings to those in the between group designs. To do this, a between-group experiment was replicated using a SCD. The results from the SCD and between-group experiment were similar. However, a cost analysis suggests the multiple baseline design (MBD), the specific type of SCD used, is more cost effective.The purpose of paper three is to compare two different types of SCDs, the MBD and a combined design, which combined the MBD with a standard SCD, known as the ABAB design. An applied aviation experiment was replicated to compare the two designs in terms of, internal and external validity, visual and statistical results, and cost. The comparison suggests that the results were similar, and that internal and external validity may be improved by the replication of phases in the combined design. However, the improvements came with a considerable increase in cost of resources and time.","The purpose of this three-paper dissertation is to examine the potential of single case research designs (SCDs) as an appropriate and efficient experimental design for use in applied aviation research.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) deployed the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program in 2006 to identify passenger behavior indicative of a possible security threat. I hypothesized that (1) U.S. passenger screening is moving towards the Israeli model, which gives priority to behavior detection and requires security interviews with all departing passengers, but (2) logistical and cultural obstacles prevent the United States from fully adopting Israel's model. To test these hypotheses, I compared Israel's current passenger screening measures with those in the United States just after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and in 2010. I found that TSA desires to emulate Israel's strategy and developed SPOT based on the Israeli system, but obstacles, such as the American reliance on technology for security and the size and scale of the American commercial aviation industry, prevent TSA from fully adopting Israel's behavioral screening model. Based on these findings, TSA should implement personal security interviews for passengers on high-risk flights and expand behavior-detection training, but also continue to use traditional screening methods such as metal detectors and x-ray machines. This thesis emphasizes the need for additional research into the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of behavior detection compared to other new screening methods.

In two experiments, participants were asked to perform a hierarchical data entry task in which they were interrupted several times. In experiment 1, novice participants were significantly more likely to commit an error on the first step immediately following an interruption than on any other step. Error rates gradually returned to baseline across the first several steps following an interruption, mirroring the pattern of response times. A bias toward repeating steps rather than skipping steps when an error is made on the resumption point was also found. In experiment 2, comparisons between novices and experts suggest that interruption-induced errors were mitigated with expertise, but response times were not. Nevertheless, experts demonstrated the same gradual return to baseline as novices for both timing and error rate data. Taken together, these results suggest that the disruptive effect of interruptions is not distributed across the span of a task but rather is localized to the first few moments immediately following an interruption. They further suggest a bias in the cognitive system toward redundant actions when errors occur. Finally, these results suggest that training and experience can mitigate interruption-induced errors, but not necessarily the robust resumption lag effect. A quantitative model—the primed retrieval model (Altmann & Trafton, 2007), is expanded to account for these results.","Recent studies suggest that response times peak immediately following an interruption and return to baseline over the next few steps, but it is not known if error rates follow this same pattern.

177,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Information behavior in aviation: Distributed practice on the flightdeck,"Human information behavior has been described as the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information seeking and information use. This includes face-to-face communication as well as passive information reception, with no intention to act on the given information. Distributed use of information within groups remains a weak link between actual information, the meaning given to information, and the sense made of the information. In the world of aviation, often times accident investigations point to a breakdown in communication with no indication of how this breakdown occurs. This work distinguishes how this breakdown may occur through understanding human information behavior on the flight deck. This study discerns that high performing flight crews practice different information behaviors than low performing or accident involved flight crews. Principles from information science, psychology, and communication studies are used to analyze how commercial flight crews involved in accidents (fail to) make use of essential, safety critical information through analysis of the related flight transcripts using a Crew Information Behavior Grid. This work serves as a way to operationalize crew resource management through understanding the social practice of information structuring and communication patterns within the distributed collective practice of the flight crew. From this, researchers may be able to identify the role information (needs, seeking, and use) plays in critical communication patterns related to supportive or ineffectual infrastructure used in the negotiation of meaning on the flight deck. This work also serves as a tool to inform crew training and is applicable to other domains where work is supported through distributed collective practice.","Human information behavior has been described as the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information seeking and information use.

The relationships between the Dunning–Kruger effect and several differentiating factors were also investigated. The sample consisted of rotary-wing aviators from around the world. Subjects self-assessed their competence amongst their peers and self-assessed their competence after taking an aviation general-knowledge examination, prior to the exam being scored. Actual competence was measured via the examination scores. The sample was separated into quartiles based on actual competence and a regression was performed to identify any relationships between the Dunning–Kruger effect and the flying-hour experience of subjects. Paired samples  t tests separated the quartiles, and a one-way ANOVA revealed the presence of the Dunning–Kruger effect in aviators in the bottom two quartiles (F[3,87] = 24.73, p< .001). A Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test showed significant differences between Quartiles 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, and 2 and 4, but not between Quartiles 1 and 2 or 3 and 4. The Dunning–Kruger effect was found to be present in the bottom quartiles of the sample but no statistically significant correlations were established between the Dunning–Kruger effect in aviators and their flying- hour experience or any other variables.

180,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Psychophysiological measures for human attention lapses during simulated aircraft operations,"This study produced a range of aviation performance to which psychophysiological measures were correlated predicting performance decrements due to task overload and vigilance decrement. A high fidelity simulation of an instrument flight pattern produced multiple workload levels resulting in various levels of performance. Psychophysiological parameters including eye movements, EEG, and peripheral temperature were measured. Workload was varied and a secondary task was added to create realistic operational performance levels. Four groups of four subjects provided 64 data segments each during two, 2 hour simulation periods. Eight subjects were instrument rated and eight unrated. Eight subjects had commercial flight experience and eight had no commercial flight experience. Operationally relevant performance levels were based upon Air Traffic Control (ATC) and safety standards. Subjects' performance error was dangerous for 18 of 1024 segments and exceeded ATC standards on additional 193 segments. The Long Fixation parameter was sensitive enough to predict 83% of segments exceeding ATC performance error standards with a 15% false alarm rate. Factors of workload, attentiveness, and cognitive processing capability affect performance; different psychophysiological parameters are needed to completely describe performance. Level of arousal reflected the “level of attention” for perception, processing, and response execution. The two best arousal parameters, Peripheral Temperature Change and Pupil Diameter Change, were the best performance predictors, these parameters reflected performance decrements related to workload and other stressors. Performance decrements associated with nominal or low workloads were not detected. Saccade Time, Dual Fixation Gate, and seven other parameters related to task type showed great promise in providing real time feedback on workload levels and the type of task on which operators are engaged. Elements of cognitive performance were described by the Long Fixation and Short Fixation parameters. A high frequency of Long Fixations was indicative of problem solving activity. A high frequency of Short Fixations was indicative of efficient processing. However, the efficiency was not related to only to workload since subjects used large numbers of short fixations when monitoring the simulation.","This study produced a range of aviation performance to which psychophysiological measures were correlated predicting performance decrements due to task overload and vigilance decrement.

181,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Comparing the accuracy of performing digital and paper checklists using a feedback package during normal workload conditions in simulated flight,"This study examined whether pilots completed airplane digital or paper checklists more accurately when they received post-flight graphic and verbal feedback. Participants were 6 college student pilots with instrument rating. The task consisted of flying flight patterns using a Frasca 241 Flight Training Device which emulates a Cirrus SR20 aircraft. The main dependent variable was the number of checklist items completed correctly per flight. An alternating treatment, multiple baseline design across pairs with reversal, was used. During baseline, the average percent of correctly completed items per flight varied considerably across participants, ranging from 13% to 57% for traditional paper checklists and ranging from 11% to 67% for digital checklists. Checklist performance increased to an average of 90% for paper checklist and an average of 89% for digital checklists after participants were given feedback and praise, and continued to improve to an average of nearly 100% for paper checklists and an average of 99% for digital checklists after the feedback and praise were removed. A slight decrement in performance was observed during a post-experiment probe between 60–90 days. Visual inspection and statistical analysis of the data suggest that paper checklist accuracy does not differ significantly from digital checklist accuracy. The results suggest that graphic feedback and praise can be used to increase the extent to which pilots use both digital and paper checklists accurately during normal workload conditions.",This study examined whether pilots completed airplane digital or paper checklists more accurately when they received post-flight graphic and verbal feedback.

This model makes specific predictions related to human interactions with machines in complex systems and provides a useful framework for designers to follow when determining future task allocations. This theory predicts that operators of systems requiring decision-making should be assigned tasks requiring controlled processing. Once a problem is perceived, this model suggests that the system should be designed such that the control tasks previously allocated to the operator could be reallocated to the machine, thus freeing the individual's problem-solving workspace. It is shown that tasks, which use automatic processing, have no effect on problem-solving ability either in ensuring that resources are available or during the actual problem-solving period. The research also demonstrates that the workspace where controlled processing occurs varies as a function of taskload in low workload conditions. If subsequently incorporated into future design processes it is believed that the use of the Reserve Resources Model offers the possibility of increasing the level of safety in complex human-machine systems.",In this paper a new central capacity model of human performance called the Reserve Resources Model is developed.

The purpose of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, a relationship or difference existed between the cognitive context of the classroom and the cognitive context of the aircraft for private pilot students. Subjects were 34 college students from three intact groups of private pilot ground school students from three colleges or universities in Oklahoma. Each subject received a pretest given by their ground school instructor followed by a practice test and posttest treatment. The posttest treatment was called the Flight Deck Cognitive Emulator. The emulator was computer-mediated and recorded the scores internally using programmed commands. In addition to measures of central tendency, Pearson  r and T-test statistics were used to assess relationships and differences and to test the hypotheses. Findings and conclusions. There appeared to be differences between the three intact groups in terms of mean age (OU 24, Rose State 31, OSU 18) and the mean of pretest scores (OU 84, Rose State 88, OSU 79). These differences may have reflected instructor capabilities or student motivation. Although differences did exist between intact groups, those subjects who volunteered from within each group resembled the greater population from which each was drawn. A high correlation (r = .98) existed between pretest and posttest scores. This may have indicated a strong relationship between knowledge-based items similar to both tests. However, pretest/posttest score means indicated that a significant difference existed between the context of cognition in the classroom and the context emulated by the Flight Deck Cognitive Emulator (OU 84/68, Rose State 88/73, OSU 79/67).

186,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Pilot weather decision making and the influence of passenger pressure,"The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of social pressure on general aviation (GA) pilots' weather decision making.  Data have shown that GA accidents associated with visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) are more likely to result in fatalities than other types of GA accidents.  This problem is compounded by the addition of passengers, who have been found to be present onboard during VFR into IMC accidents more frequently than in other types of GA accidents.  The question is whether passengers influence a pilot's decision to continue flight into adverse weather.  The extent other individual factors play a role in a pilots' decision to continue through adverse weather, including prior experience (i.e., flight hours), basic weather knowledge, decision-making, risk perception and tolerance, and the ability of the pilot to assert themselves in the cockpit were explored.  To examine these questions, social pressure by passengers during flight was manipulated to encourage pilots to continue or divert from adverse weather.   Results conclude that the distance the pilot continued into the weather for positively motivated pilots (persuaded to continue) increased, and decreased for the pilots who were negatively motivated (persuaded to divert).  The significant findings of persuasion on distance into the weather were compounded by the lack of awareness of the pilots on the impact of the passenger on their decision making behavior.  Additional findings suggest that private pilots with instrument ratings are continuing further than either the low time VFR pilots or the high time commercial and/or ATP pilots.","The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of social pressure on general aviation (GA) pilots' weather decision making.

187,2025,Journal of Transportation Security,Radical calm in aviation security: profiling controlled dissociation and behavioral ambiguity at checkpoints,"Background In the context of aviation security, the display of extreme calmness by potentially dangerous individuals presents a behavioral paradox. While appearing non-threatening, such demeanor may reflect controlled dissociation or intentional affect suppression. Despite global advancements in behavioral detection, this specific form of ambiguity remains underexamined in risk profiling frameworks. This paper introduces “radical calm” as a novel construct within behavioral profiling, highlighting its relevance for identifying concealed threats that evade traditional detection models. Methods This study integrates established psychological theories of dissociation with analysis of real-world incidents, including behaviors exhibited by 9/11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah, as well as comparative profiles of drug couriers and ideologically driven actors. A targeted literature review (2020–2024) was conducted alongside qualitative behavioral assessment using psychophysiological indicators and threat-context variables. Results Findings reveal that controlled dissociation—characterized by emotional neutrality, inhibited microexpressive output, and suppression of physical agitation—is a recurring trait among high-risk individuals at aviation checkpoints. These behavioral patterns often bypass standard stress-detection protocols, but become detectable through integrated contextual and kinetic profiling. Conclusion The phenomenon of “radical calm” warrants formal classification as a distinct risk marker in aviation security. This study introduces a foundational behavioral model to support frontline personnel in identifying deceptive calmness and decoding subtle nonverbal anomalies. Enhancing profiler awareness of dissociative suppression may significantly improve early threat recognition and intervention capabilities.","Background In the context of aviation security, the display of extreme calmness by potentially dangerous individuals presents a behavioral paradox.

188,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Four-Dimensional Modeling and Simulation for use in Interactive Airspace Training Materials,"The findings from this research provide evidence that a four-dimensional flight-training program can improve flight-planning results for individual pilot and flight dispatcher students. Data collected from 22 student volunteers recruited from Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio were analyzed using the Independent Group t-Test. These raw data were used to determine a 27% passing rate for those in the control group and a 73% passing rate for those in the experimental group. A required minimum score of 70% was used as the benchmark for passing. The results demonstrated there was a statistically significant difference for points earned on the flight-planning task for the experimental group versus the control group using a two-tailed analysis, t(20) -2.07, p< .05. In addition to the traditional flight-planning materials and information provided to both groups, the experimental group was also supplied with the novel four-dimensional airspace presentation and interface. An examination of the mean level of difference between the students determined that the experimental group exhibited statistically significant improved performance using the novel interface compared to those in the control group. The results of the Levene's Test for Equality of Variances indicated that the two variances were approximately equal between the groups. The study addressed the research gap for Satellite Tool Kit (STK) generated four-dimensional airspace presentations and interfaces in aviation academic applications. Future researchers may expand on these findings by testing refined interfaces with larger and more diverse student and professional populations at multiple locations. This acquisition of knowledge is also applicable for operational aviation and non-aviation fields where similar visualizations and interfaces might be useful.","The findings from this research provide evidence that a four-dimensional flight-training program can improve flight-planning results for individual pilot and flight dispatcher students.

190,1996,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The development of a rating scale to measure the situation awareness of student civil pilots,"Given the growing concern in the civil aviation community about increased incidents of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT's) and the general acceptance of situation awareness (SA), or the lack thereof, as a contributing factor to such, the objective of the present study was to develop a subjective technique for measuring the SA of student (Ab Initio) civil pilots which would allow for its training. Both a framework for understanding and a method for measuring SA were derived in order to integrate formal theory with the understanding of pilots. Research was conducted over four phases. After an initial phase in which 28 elements considered constitutive of SA were generated by both a literature review and semi-structured interviews of pilots, these were validated in a second phase through the expert ratings of flight instructors and academic researchers. A Principal Components Analysis of the 22 remaining elements was then undertaken in a third phase, which rendered a six-factor core. The factor structure was found to be stable across phases of flight (i.e., departure, cruise, and arrival) and generalizable between groups (e.g., flight school students, air transport pilots). The usability of the scales was addressed in a fourth phase, where flight school instructors were asked to assess in-flight/in-simulator and post-flight/post-simulator applicability. This resulted in a final version of the Cranfield Situation Awareness Scale (Cranfield SAS) and a shortened prototype for in-flight and in-simulator use. The scales derived were 'Pilot Knowledge,' 'Anticipation and Understanding of Future Events,' 'Management of Stress, Effort, and Commitment,' 'Capacity to Perceive, Attend, Assimilate, and Assess Information,' and 'Overall Awareness'. A framework model for understanding SA was then proposed which would integrate the Person-Environment pit model of stress offered by French, Rodgers, and Cobb (1974) with Neisser's (1976) perceptual cycle in order to address the interaction of factors. Situation Awareness was said to be the 'operational space' within which personal and environmental factors affect performance.

191,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A Situated Approach to Situation Awareness in Aircraft Accidents: A Case Study of Runway Overruns in Air Carrier Operations,"Human factors are the most frequent cause of aviation accidents, and researchers have created numerous models to explain Situation Awareness (SA), the phenomenon by which humans observe, process, and react to surrounding events.  The purpose of this qualitative, archival case study was to explore the use of Situated SA (SSA) as an accident investigation tool capable of explaining the sociotechnical system within the cockpit during aircraft overrun events.  The research questions had a threefold purpose: identify outliers within the scenarios that may have led to SA shortfalls within the overrun scenarios, evaluate the efficacy of SSA as an accident analysis tool, and provide additional information to support or conflict with SSA theory.  This researcher examined official accident reports, transcripts of cockpit voice recorders, and transcripts of interviews conducted by NTSB investigators with the aircrew involved shortly after the accidents.   The majority of outliers in each scenario were attributed to human error. The most common outliers across the scenarios were a failure of the pilot to take appropriate action and the lack of training for events dealing with snowy runways and poor visibility.   There were no unexplained phenomena using the SSA model.  Despite the differences between scenarios, the consistent reporting method by the NTSB and the structured tenets of the SSA model allowed for the categorization and comparison of the cognitive processes of the accident pilots.  However, data offloading (a key tenet of SSA) was difficult to assess based on the chosen data sources, calling into question whether pilots download information from the environment during time critical, off-nominal situations such as runway overruns.  Based on this case study, it is recommended that pilots prepare for overrun scenarios prior to landing, and system failures during deteriorating weather conditions should be added to pilot training syllabi.  Also, other SA models should be assessed for their capability to explain cognitive processes within the cockpit of overrun scenarios. Finally, conducting similar studies for accidents in other phases of flight would build a more holistic picture of the capabilities of the SA models in the aviation context.","Human factors are the most frequent cause of aviation accidents, and researchers have created numerous models to explain Situation Awareness (SA), the phenomenon by which humans observe, process, and react to surrounding events.

192,1991,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Quantitative assessment of human performance in cockpit-related systems,"The NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System documents that approximately 80% of aviation accidents are due to human error. In order to provide a safer environment, it is important to identify the cause of human error and performance at a specific time. Human involvement in cockpit operations can be affected by permanent characteristics or situational circumstances in the form of physical, mental and environmental loads. Therefore, an attempt is made to study the effects of cockpit conditions, i.e., instrument settings and 90 dBA (decibel in A scale) pre-recorded cockpit noise, on cognitive performance for nine cognitive tests of the Complex Cognitive Abilities Battery (CCAB). The other performance measures are mean heart rate (MHR), standard deviation for heart rate (SDHR), subjective ratings (NASA Task Load Index) and correct (%) readings of the altitude and air speed for fifteen male and fifteen female subjects. The 16PF personality profiles, visual and hearing acuity of the subjects are also determined.The results indicate that there is a statistically significant effect of the CCAB tests on cognitive performance (test scores) and SDHR. The instrument setting has significant effects on the CCAB test scores and TLX ratings. Noise has significant effects on MHR along with TLX ratings. There are no significant differences between gender and pilot/non-pilot groups. Findings indicate that subjective measures are sensitive to both mental and physical stressors. However, physiological measures tend to be sensitive only to physical stressors, whereas cognitive measures are sensitive only to mental stressors. In complex systems where the individuals are exposed not only to mental stressors but also to physical stressors, the performance measures should be more comprehensive and should include cognitive and physiological as well as subjective measures. With this approach, the effects of the system on the individuals may be established in a comprehensive way so that the system requirements and design improvements can be determined.","The NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System documents that approximately 80% of aviation accidents are due to human error.

194,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A mixed methods study of designated pilot examiners experiences with Advanced Display Technology and technology advanced aircraft,"This study is a mixed methods investigation into the experiences of FAA Flight Examiners with the certification of private pilots in technology advanced general aviation aircraft. The study sampled 100 examiners from across the US and then performed a follow-up telephone interview with 10 examiners that were highly experienced with advanced technology in general aviation aircraft. This research indicates there are incidents where safety is being negatively impacted as a result of the current certification process for new airmen. Surprisingly, the DPEs perceived little need for changes to the FAA's rules and regulations with the exception of a need for a technology endorsement. Rather, the greatest need is for more structure and standardization in the pilot training curriculum with advanced technology and the monitoring/enforcement of training objectives. To that end, instructors and examiners must be proficient in the technology that they are teaching and certifying pilots in.  This research re-enforces the findings in the 2010 NTSB study of glass cockpits in light aircraft.",This study is a mixed methods investigation into the experiences of FAA Flight Examiners with the certification of private pilots in technology advanced general aviation aircraft.

195,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Human performance analysis of Controller -Pilot Data Link Communications,"The researcher examined how the introduction and application of Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) technology will affect human performance in the single-pilot general aviation work environment. Unlike conventional voice-based air traffic control (ATC) communications technology, the CPDLC system will allow pilots and controllers to exchange text-based messages via specifically designated data links. Instrument-rated pilots ( N = 30) were tested on both a series of CPDLC text command tasks and a series of conventional voice command tasks in a simulated flight environment. Measures of performance were response time and number of errors made in pilot recall/execution across the command condition (voice or text) given the level of command workload (high, moderate, or low) and order of flight presentation (voice or text first). Results revealed a statistically significant decrease in both errors in pilot recall/execution and response times in moving from the conventional voice ATC commands to the CPDLC text commands. Results were significant across all levels of air traffic control command loads (high, moderate, and low). However, a conservative post hoc analysis revealed no significant decrease in pilot response time at the moderate load ATC command level. The results of this study supported the view that human performance can be improved when complex information was presented in visual form and users can refer to the text again. Further data analysis revealed that while pilots responding to the high parameter load text commands had both significantly fewer errors and reduced response times than when responding to the high parameter load voice commands; this performance effect appears to diminish at the moderate and low command workloads. Results lend support for a text-based communications technology which extends pilot's working memory, thereby improving both accuracy and efficiency in performing flight tasks to complex commands.","The researcher examined how the introduction and application of Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) technology will affect human performance in the single-pilot general aviation work environment.

196,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Normal operations safety survey: Measuring system performance in air traffic control,"The Normal Operations Safety Survey (NOSS) is an observational methodology to collect safety data during normal Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations. It aims to inform organizations about safety matters by using trained ATC staff to take a structured look at everyday operations. By monitoring normal operations through the use of direct over-the-shoulder observations, it is believed that safety deficiencies can be identified in a proactive manner prior to the occurrence of accidents or incidents.\nNOSS was developed as a collaborative effort between the International Civil Aviation Organization, ATC providers, controller representatives, government regulators, and academics to fill a gap in available ATC safety information.  System designers consider three basic assumptions: the technology needed to achieve the system production goals, the training necessary for people to operate the technology, and the regulations that dictate system behavior.  These assumptions represent the expected performance. When systems are deployed, however, particularly in realms as complex as ATC, they do not perform quite as designed. NOSS aims to capture the operational drift that invariably occurs upon system deployment.  NOSS captures how the ATC system operates in reality, as opposed to how it was intended to operate.\nNOSS is premised on the Threat and Error Management (TEM) framework. TEM frames human performance in complex and dynamic settings from an operational perspective by simultaneously focusing on the environment and how operators respond to that environment. TEM posits that threats and errors are a part of everyday operations in ATC and must be managed in order to maintain safety margins.\nThis dissertation describes NOSS and its contributions to ATC safety management systems. It addresses the validity and reliability of NOSS data and presents case studies from field trials conducted by a number of ATC providers.","The Normal Operations Safety Survey (NOSS) is an observational methodology to collect safety data during normal Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations.

197,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Fatigue mitigation effects of en-route napping on commercial airline pilots flying international routes,"The introduction of ultra-long range commercial aircraft and the evolution of the commercial airline industry has provided new opportunities for air carriers to fly longer range international route segments while deregulation, industry consolidation, and the constant drive to reduce costs wherever possible has pressured airline managements to seek more productivity from their pilots. At the same time, advancements in the understanding of human physiology have begun to make their way into flight and duty time regulations and airline scheduling practices. In this complex and ever changing operating environment, there remains an essential need to better understand how these developments, and other daily realities facing commercial airline pilots, are affecting their fatigue management strategies as they go about their rituals of getting to and from their homes to work and performing their flight assignments. Indeed, the need for commercial airline pilots to have access to better and more effective fatigue mitigation tools to combat fatigue and insure that they are well rested and at the top of their game when flying long-range international route segments has never been greater.This study examined to what extent the maximum fatigue states prior to napping, as self-accessed by commercial airline pilots flying international route segments, were affected by a number of other common flight assignment related factors. The study also examined to what extent the availability of scheduled en-route rest opportunities, in an onboard crew rest facility, affected the usage of en-route napping as a fatigue mitigation strategy, and to what extent the duration of such naps affected the perceived benefits of such naps as self-accessed by commercial airline pilots flying international route segments. The study utilized an online survey tool to collect data on crew position, prior flight segments flown in the same duty period, augmentation, commuting, pre-flight rest obtained in the previous 24 hour period, fatigue state at report time, circadian rhythm disruptions, assigned rest periods in an onboard crew rest facility, experiencing spontaneous sleep episodes, and napping metrics. The study also reports on some common en-route fatigue mitigation strategy themes, as reported by the study participants and how these relate to the survey question responses of survey participants. Study results suggest that there are significant relationships between fatigue states prior to napping and augmentation, fatigue states when reporting for duty, assignment to en-route rest in an onboard crew rest facility, and having experienced spontaneous sleep episodes. The study results also suggest that there is not a significant relationship between being assigned scheduled rest periods in an onboard crew rest facility and the usage of en-route napping as part of an individual pilot’s fatigue mitigation stategy. Finally, the study results suggest that short duration naps, averaging less than 30 minutes, are most commonly being employed by the subject population to beneficial effect.","The introduction of ultra-long range commercial aircraft and the evolution of the commercial airline industry has provided new opportunities for air carriers to fly longer range international route segments while deregulation, industry consolidation, and the constant drive to reduce costs wherever possible has pressured airline managements to seek more productivity from their pilots.

Previous research has shown primary attention is given to presignificant event training and stress management, however there remains an important gap in the current literature regarding postsignificant event stress within the aviation profession. The purpose of this cross-sectional quantitative study was to use the observational lens of stress theory and survey U.S. pilots who have experienced an inflight emergency, looking for correlation between factors such as age, gender, flight experience, and training against a pilot's self-reported level of residual stress. Using snowball sampling methodology, 101 pilots were anonymously surveyed, with 89% responding that they had some level of residual stress via the Impact of Event Scale-Revised instrument. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the correlation between 9 personal and professional characteristics and pilot's stress level was significant, at R2 = .22, adjusted R 2 = .14, F(9, 91) = 2.8, p< .01. The sample's correlation coefficient was .47, indicating that approximately 22% of the variance in the residual stress was accounted for by the 9 personal and professional characteristics. Findings from this research will help clarify how pilot training and demographics can affect postsignificant event stress. This knowledge will be an important contribution to the existing literature and enhance social initiatives though an increased awareness of residual stress within the pilot profession. The results can be used to increase aviation safety by enabling the industry and government entities to develop and implement effective stress training initiatives.","Every day aircraft pilots must successfully resolve significant inflight situations and then manage the possibility of residual psychological and physiological stress.

199,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The 1g mental model invoked by General Aviation pilots and its implication in inadvertent stalls,"Low altitude stall/spin accidents continue to contribute a high proportion of fatalities associated with General Aviation (GA) flight operations each year. One scenario in particular, often referred to as a ""Moose Stall"", involves maneuvering flight at low altitude in order to spot and track a particular target of interest on the ground. A combination of channelized attention and increased complexity in the flight dynamics associated with steep-banked maneuvering flight places a pilot in a situation where he may not normally operate and where his awareness of aircraft performance may be degraded. Error taxonomy posits a heavy reliance on previous behavior for both automatic and problem-solving performance. A mental model, developed to a large extent by past experience, can be considered the basis for such behavior. By assessing situation awareness (SA), it is possible to gain insight into a pilot's mental model in order to highlight potential deficiencies that may contribute to errors involved in maneuvering flight. This study examined the SA of sixteen novice and expert pilots over varying degrees of maneuvering flight in a fight simulator. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) instrument was used to query pilots about their awareness of specific flight parameters. A 3 x 2 mixed experimental design was used to assess within differences in awareness during maneuvering flight with increasing bank angles (5, 25, and 45 degrees of bank) and awareness differences between two levels of experience (novice and expert). Additionally, a performance maneuver compared aircraft control techniques between novice and expert pilots during a steep-banked, low-altitude, level turn. Analysis of the SAGAT data revealed novice pilots displayed decreased awareness as bank angle increased while expert awareness remained relatively stable with increasing bank angle. However, a lack of difference between novice and expert awareness led to the conclusion that novice and expert pilot mental models were different and that the SAGAT technique, which focused on perceptual SA, did not fully capture expert mental models that may involve better comprehension of flight dynamics. The performance maneuver was inconclusive due to perceptual limitations associated with the flight simulation.","Low altitude stall/spin accidents continue to contribute a high proportion of fatalities associated with General Aviation (GA) flight operations each year.

This study investigates the role of individual differences in explaining the transfer of learning from 1 phase of training to another among pilot trainees in a multistage, aviation training program. Using 3 of the Big Five factors (Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Openness to Experience), the results showed these measures to contribute to the prediction of the number of hours it took for trainees to attain their private pilot's license. Significant interactions between some of these measures and success on an earlier, simulator phase of the training program were also found.

Understanding distributed cognitions in HROs offers the potential promise of avoiding disaster. HROs such as military aircraft, nuclear power plants or emergency surgical wards must develop and share resilient collective cognitive structures capable of making sense in increasingly complex technologically dependent environments. Operationalizing Bougon's (1992) Theory of Congregate Cognitive Maps (CCM), the first CCMs for an HRO, more specifically a Coast Guard C130 Aircraft engaged in Law Enforcement and Search and Rescue were constructed. Findings suggest that despite changing participants and despite differing beliefs and assumptions of diverse participants, resiliency and reliability in organizations can be achieved by learning the language of congregation, that is, a specific grammar and syntax to organizing. The CCM is the organization and it can be manifestly utilized for organizational development and improvement. Distributed cognitions and collective actions, as the product and process of organizational learning, fosters discovering and interpreting new information that assists adaptation, renewal and learning. Characteristics of resilient sensemaking are believed to be manifest within the supporting congregate cognitive maps (CCMs) of HROs. Cognitive mapping offers the methodological access to describing the complex relationship between the content and structure of individual participants and congregate cognitive mapping now affords a method of describing the organizing collectivity such as the collective knowledge in specific action domains such as aerial law enforcement. Relating the deep collective cognitive structure embodied within CCMs to collective sensemaking affords an opportunity to pursue an operational construct of resilient distributed cognitions and collective action.","Scholars have yet to agree on how distributed cognitions and actions can be characterized, and under what conditions collective cognitive structure associated with high reliability organizations (HROs) emerges, is activated and then transferred to others.

202,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Identification, Evaluation, and Causal Factor Determination of Maintenance Errors Common to Major U.S. Certificated Air Carriers","The purpose of this mixed methods study was the identification of common errors, causal factors and corrective actions related to maintenance errors affecting aircraft with more than 70 seats and operated by major U.S. air carriers. FAA compliance action letters obtained by FOIA for American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines were examined to identify errors and causal elements for categorization and further study. Delta Air Lines letters were requested but not provided by the FAA. Participants were randomly selected from FAA listings of certificated mechanics and asked to complete a survey. Quantitative data was acquired from 48 participants that met selection criteria and completed the survey. Qualitative data was acquired from interviews conducted with nine of the survey participants. Using the categories developed from the FAA data, the study found common errors with the completion of maintenance entries, handling of maintenance documents, content of maintenance instructions, installation of parts, deviations from maintenance procedures, and maintenance steps or tasks that were overlooked or not performed. Dominant causal factors were identified as failure to follow instructions or procedural requirements, and maintenance and process instructions that contain inaccurate information or lacked sufficient detail. The dominate human factors identified in the study were complacency and lack of attention. Study participants noted that complacency was primarily responsible for failure to follow instructions. Performance of repetitive or simple tasks was a causal factor that drove complacency. Direct or indirect demands on mechanics to quickly return aircraft to service also contributed to the performance of maintenance without the use of instructions. Significant corrective actions taken by air carriers included the imposition of controls to prevent the release of flight plans for aircraft that have overdue inspection items, improvements to allow for greater access to maintenance manuals, and a program for the review of instructions by maintenance personnel prior to publication. Suggested corrective actions include automation of manual processes used to track recurring inspections, improved drafting of instructions with mechanic involvement, improved training of new mechanics to instill good habits and providing maintenance instructions through the use of personal electronic devices.","The purpose of this mixed methods study was the identification of common errors, causal factors and corrective actions related to maintenance errors affecting aircraft with more than 70 seats and operated by major U.S. air carriers.

The results showed that the participants’ reaction time on the flanker task increased significantly relative to their responses on the second-to-last day before the period of bed rest, their galvanic skin response weakened and their degrees of positive affect declined during the bed rest period. Our results provide some evidence for a detrimental effect of prolonged bed rest on executive functioning and positive affect.

205,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A Comparative Study between Cockpit Stress and Aeronautical Decision-Making among General Aviation and Professional Pilots,"The airplane cockpit is a work environment that has not been extensively studied for its effects of stress and mental health, and as such, provides a unique opportunity for the industrial-organizational (I-O) psychology practitioner to study the role that stress plays on pilot decision-making and how it might impact pilot performance in the cockpit.  This research is a comparative study between cockpit stress and aeronautical decision-making (ADM) among nonprofessional general aviation pilots and professional pilots, utilizing quantitative methodology with nonexperimental methods to establish both a comparison and a correlation between cockpit stress and ADM among professional and general aviation pilots.  The topic is important to the field of psychology and, more specifically, to the I-O psychology specialization because the cockpit represents a work environment where stress impairment can impact pilot performance and wellbeing.  ADM requires a significant amount of mental energy that is not always utilized efficiently, even among professional pilots, and studying the differences among these groups of pilots can add to the knowledge that already exists.  This distinction represents a significant gap in the literature that must be examined.  The population for this study consisted of 107 nonprofessional general aviation and professional pilots operating under Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 91, Part 91K, FAR Part 121, and FAR Part 135, and possessing either FAA commercial pilot or airline transport pilot ratings.  Hypothesis 1 revealed significant differences in perceived stress between the two pilot groups with the professional pilots experiencing more perceived stress.  Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4, however, failed to yield any statistically significant proof that there were differences or relationships among perceived stress and ADM among the nonprofessional and professional pilot groups.","The airplane cockpit is a work environment that has not been extensively studied for its effects of stress and mental health, and as such, provides a unique opportunity for the industrial-organizational (I-O) psychology practitioner to study the role that stress plays on pilot decision-making and how it might impact pilot performance in the cockpit.

206,2012,PQDT - Global,A Study Into Situation Management Applied to Time-Critical Decision-Making in Aviation Security,"This thesis addresses technological support to decision-making in time-critical environments. In particular, I develop and apply an information-theoretic approach to situation management in aviation security.This thesis investigates the factors affecting situation management and addresses the challenges of establishing timely situation awareness to support the ‘course of action’ selection. In order to efficiently manage an aviation security incident, a situation management approach can provide the required technological capability in this dynamic and complex environment.Situation management research is still in its infancy and more research concerning underlying methodologies and techniques is required. This work therefore models situation management as a collaborative information problem and explores the factors from a macro-perspective modelling the problem as a multi-agent system.The goal of the research is to explore and develop an information-theoretic framework for decision support systems in situation management contexts. This thesis presents the approach to design and develop a situation management framework within the aviation security context. The modelling work and experiments were implemented with an agent-based simulation software tool (Repast version 2.0). The framework and its implementation has been validated based on use case studies. The performance of the proposed agent model in comparison to two recent European live trial scenarios has been tested to emulate real-time constraints and requirements.The results obtained indicate that automation support for time-critical decision-making in aviation security supports the early identification of incidents and increases the situational awareness during the management of an incident. This allows decision-makers to select from a wider range of options, as the time-window for the deployment of responses increases. Next to the validation of the concept and framework developed, an initial situation management capability for aviation security in SESAR is defined.The work reported in this thesis demonstrates that the situation management concept and framework is applicable for multi-agency coordination and collaboration in aviation security incident management.","This thesis addresses technological support to decision-making in time-critical environments. In particular, I develop and apply an information-theoretic approach to situation management in aviation security.This thesis investigates the factors affecting situation management and addresses the challenges of establishing timely situation awareness to support the ‘course of action’ selection. In order to efficiently manage an aviation security incident, a situation management approach can provide the required technological capability in this dynamic and complex environment.Situation management research is still in its infancy and more research concerning underlying methodologies and techniques is required.","<title>A Study Into Situation Management Applied to Time-Critical Decision-Making in Aviation Security</title> <excerpt>This thesis addresses technological support to decision-making in time-critical environments.

209,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Meaningfulness as a Moderator for Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Following Critical Incident Exposure in Coast Guard Aviators,"Coast Guard aviators’ vast array of missions leads to occupational exposure to traumatic events.  These events can surpass the coping skills of the aviator and be deemed critical incidents.  In some cases, critical incident exposure can lead to posttraumatic stress symptoms.  Posttraumatic stress symptoms are harmful to the occupational performance and personal well-being of these individuals. One theory proposed that job meaningfulness could aid in converting critical incident exposure into posttraumatic growth, as opposed to negative symptomology. The relationships between critical incident exposure, job meaningfulness, and posttraumatic stress symptomology are unclear in Coast Guard Aviators. 	This study seeks to understand these relationships using quantitative analysis.  The role of demographics is also considered.  The correlation between these variables and the moderating role of job meaningfulness on the relationship between critical incident exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms were tested using hierarchical linear regression.

However, few studies have investigated the changing trend of this parenting style and the parental and emerging adult factors that influence the trend. This study tracked 455 first-year university students (78.2% female; Mage = 18.73, SDage = 1.19) over three measurement points: 2, 4, and 14 months after enrollment. Through a latent growth model, the study revealed a significant downward trend in helicopter parenting behaviors among Chinese parents during the first year of their emerging-adult children’s college life. Both parental failure mindsets and the autonomy and separation anxiety of emerging adults influenced the initial level of the declining trend in helicopter parenting. In contrast, only behavioral engagement of emerging adults in school activities is the key factor leading parents to reduce their overparenting behaviors. This study tracks the dynamics of helicopter parenting and identifies parental and emerging adult factors that shape its trajectory. The findings provide insights into reducing helicopter parenting practices and supporting emerging adults’ adjustment during critical transitions.","Extensive research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of helicopter parenting on the adjustment of emerging adults.

Research factors included (a) purchasing perceptions, which consisted of satisfaction, loyalty, perceived value, and service quality; (b) social environment, which consisted of age, gender, and cultural differences relative to Hofstede’s (1980) cultural dimensions; and (c) experiences, which consisted of frequent flyer status and Internet use frequency. A convenience sample was solicited from graduate students (master’s and doctoral) studying at colleges/universities in northern and central Florida. The sample size used to test the study’s hypotheses consisted of 345 participants. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that loyalty and the Masculinity–Femininity cultural dimension were strong predictors of eWOM activities, while loyalty, perceived value, age, the Uncertainty Avoidance cultural dimension, and eWOM activities were strong predictors of purchasing involvement. The findings also showed that eWOM activities fully mediated the relationship between loyalty and purchasing involvement, and partially mediated the relationship between purchasing involvement and the cultural dimensions of Power Distance and Masculinity–Femininity, respectively. Findings suggest that improving passengers’ loyalty via eWOM activities can help inform their purchasing decisions in the digital era. Moreover, eWOM activities can help passengers who live in high power distance and masculine cultures to easily make a purchasing decision relative to products and services of U.S. airlines. Thus, eWOM activities should be used as a promotional instrument to help inform passengers’ purchasing decisions.","The purpose of the study was manifold: (a) to examine the relationship a set of targeted factors has on electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) activities in the context of aviation, (b) to examine the extent to which these factors affect airline passengers’ purchasing involvement, and (c) to determine the extent to which eWOM activities mediate the relationship between the targeted factors and purchasing involvement.

213,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Predicting Inattentional Blindness with Pupillary Response in a Simulated Flight Task,"Inattentional blindness (IB) is the failure of observers to notice the presence of a clearly viewable but unexpected visual event when attentional resources are diverted elsewhere. Knowing when an operator is unable to respond or detect an unexpected event may help improve safety during task performance. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict when such failures might occur. The current study was a secondary data analysis of data collected in the Human and Autonomous Vehicle Systems Laboratory at NASA Langley Research Center. Specifically, 60 subjects (29 male, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, mean age of 34.5 years (SD = 13.3) were randomly assigned to one of three automation conditions (full automation, partial automation, and full manual) and took part in a simulated flight landing task. The dependent variable was the detection/non-detection of an IB occurrence (a truck on the landing runway).Scores on the NASA-TLX workload rating scale varied significantly by automation condition. The full automation condition reported the lowest subjective task load followed by partial automation and then manual condition. IB detection varied significantly across automation condition. The moderate workload condition of partial automation exhibited the lowest likelihood of IB occurrence. The low workload full automation condition did not differ significantly from the manual condition. Subjects who reported higher task demand had increased pupil dilation and subjects with larger pupil dilation were more likely to detect the runway incursion. These results show eye tracking may be used to identify periods of reduced unexpected visual stimulus detection for possible real-time IB mitigation.","Inattentional blindness (IB) is the failure of observers to notice the presence of a clearly viewable but unexpected visual event when attentional resources are diverted elsewhere.

This study investigated the pick-up of visual information to time weight transfer and bat kinematics within an exemplar group of striking sport experts using an in situ temporal occlusion paradigm. Highly skilled cricket batsmen faced bowlers and attempted to strike delivered balls, whilst their vision was either temporally occluded through occlusion glasses prior to ball bounce or not occluded (control condition). A chronometric analysis was conducted on trials in the occlusion condition to quantify the pick-up of visual information to time biomechanical variables. Results indicated that initiation of weight transfer and bat downswing, as well as bat downswing completion, was significantly different between some individual batsmen. No significant difference was found between individual batsmen for time of weight transfer completion. Unexpectedly, it was found that achievement of the goal to strike delivered balls, that is, the frequency of bat-ball contacts was not significantly different between batsmen. Collectively, the findings indicate that individual differences exist in the coordination pattern of a complex whole body visual perceptual-motor skill, but these different patterns are used to achieve a similar outcome, which is known as motor equivalence.","Expertise studies into visual perceptual-motor skills have mainly focused their investigation upon group comparisons rather than individual comparisons.

216,2015,Journal for Multicultural Education,Resilience: paradoxical insight or conceptual poverty?,"Purpose – This paper aims to look at some of the evidence that supports the construct of resilience and the operationalisation of the “phenomena” of resilience within contemporary society. The concept of resilience has become an influential and society-wide construct, embraced by the positive psychology movement and impacting on educational, health and social policy significantly and demonstrably. Importantly, the concept of resilience has a substantial historical heritage and legacy and the permeation of the construct within the collective social consciousness is rarely considered or queried, but generally accepted and embraced. Moreover, the construct of resilience within itself is invariably couched within contemporary discourse as a universal good and highly desirable attribute and further still, considered by many as a fundamental component contributing to the fabric of an individual’s character. Design/methodology/approach – The design of this paper is a short review of selective evidence of key conceptual issues. Findings – Resilience as a concept, is defuse, generally ill-defined and highly subjective. The concept of resilience, though popular and intrinsic to a number of aspects of public and educational policy, remains controversial, provides an explanatory account of differential outcomes which may not always be positive and, importantly, may potentially disenfranchise the individual. Originality/value – The synthesis of the brief and selective appraisal of evidence in this area suggests that the concept of resilience, if it exists at all, is highly mercurial, ambiguous in definition and despite its omnipresence as a representation of a positive and internalised attribution to the individual, has a significant negative side which is seldom considered. Querying the concept of resilience against the overwhelming backdrop of positive belief and opinion regarding the concept may represent a social heresy, however, the balance of evidence would suggest a debate about the concept is long overdue and, moreover, the concept itself provides a useful fulcrum to consider where beliefs, attitudes and opinions about abstract concepts stop and science, evidence and fact-based reflection begin.","Purpose – This paper aims to look at some of the evidence that supports the construct of resilience and the operationalisation of the “phenomena” of resilience within contemporary society.

217,2001,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Measuring and understanding individual differences in the situation awareness of workers in high -intensity jobs,"Situation awareness (SA) has long been a concept confined to the field of aviation. However, its usefulness to the examination of the information-processing and decision-making processes can be extended to other occupational fields. This study extends the work of previous authors by conducting research on individual SA differences in workers in a high-intensity job outside of the aviation field. An assessment center metric that is based upon a thorough job analysis is presented as an objective measure of SA outside of a simulator. The measure demonstrated acceptable content and discriminate validity as well as acceptable reliability. A model of individual differences in the three levels of SA of workers in high-intensity jobs was shown to account for significant variance in the three levels of SA. Individual difference variables of experience, cognitive ability, and perceptual speed and accuracy explained 41 percent of the variance in the first level of SA (perception). The equations explaining significant amounts of variance in the second and third levels of SA (comprehension and projection) were based upon the preceding SA level and not on the measures of the individual cognitive abilities investigated, demonstrating the sequential nature of SA. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of SA research to favorably impact business. The use of SA as a measure of effectiveness for information technology systems could provide insight into the design of software. It may well give a good indication of whether the system is just providing perceptual information that must be fused and filtered by the human operator or whether it provides information that is packaged such that understanding and decisions are natural conclusions following the presentation of the information. Incorporating the concept of SA into the human resource process might also be fruitful. Applying SA to the selection of people for jobs has the potential to ensure that workers in high-intensity jobs are capable of obtaining high levels of SA under high information and high workload conditions. The application of knowledge learned from the investigation of SA to training programs may also be fruitful if people can be trained in certain aspects of SA.","Situation awareness (SA) has long been a concept confined to the field of aviation.

218,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Exploring Consumer Perceptions of Airline Revenue Enhancing Practices,"The airline industry in the United States has been characterized by destructive competition and high rates of bankruptcy since deregulation in 1978. Only those airlines that practiced effective revenue management survived. Revenue management and the pressure to increase revenues have produced several practices such as price discrimination, overbooking, and additional fees for checked luggage that have troubled the airline consumer and created intense dissatisfaction as reflected in recent surveys, which consistently rate overall quality of airline travel as negative since 1991. The problem is the negative impact of revenue enhancing business practices that are reflected in consumer attitudes and behaviors. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore consumer perceptions of revenue enhancing practices in the domestic market that have resulted in negative or undesirable consequences. This research study was conducted by interviewing 20 experienced airline consumers residing primarily in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. The study used a semi-structured interview process for data collection and the modified Van Kamm method of data analysis. Four themes emerged from analysis of interview data concerning consumer reactions to revenue enhancing practices: Utility, Disappointment, Resignation, and Indifference. Utility concerned perceptions of revenue enhancing practices that fulfilled a consumer need or were described in a utilitarian fashion. Disappointment concerned revenue enhancing practices that were perceived negatively, sometimes as an outright violation of trust or other psychological human needs. Within this theme, consumer behavior changes could produce negative consequences to the airline. Resignation concerned perceptions of limited consumer choice or available options in response to objectionable revenue enhancing practices. The findings also indicated that perceptions such as these can move to the theme of disappointment if consumer perceptions regarding options change. The theme of indifference indicated a perceived lack of concern regarding certain revenue enhancing practices, especially if there would be no personal effect or consequence as a result. It was recommended that future research include an evaluation of a much larger sample size of airline consumers to include all levels of travel experience in order to better assess variances between major market segments as they relate to revenue enhancing practices.","The airline industry in the United States has been characterized by destructive competition and high rates of bankruptcy since deregulation in 1978.

219,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The impact of cooperative learning in collegiate aviation education on student engagement in a diverse community college environment,"For decades, the US aviation industry has been dominated by white males, particularly in the ranks of pilots, air traffic controllers and aviation management professionals. The representation of women and minorities is well below the norms of most industries. Collegiate aviation has experienced increasing enrollments of women and minorities but the retention and graduation rates remain low. The community college in this study has experienced the same disappointing results. While most aviation colleges use traditional lecture and discussion instruction, this has not proven effective for this community college with its increasingly diverse population. It was believed that the implementation of cooperative learning strategies would help these aviation students achieve improved academic performance through higher levels of student engagement. The purpose of this quasi-experimental quantitative study was to measure the impact of a cooperative learning treatment on student engagement in a diverse group of community college freshman enrolled in an aviation fundamentals course. The cooperative learning treatment group was compared to a control group receiving instruction through lecture and discussion only. Student engagement was measured through the College Student Experiences Questionnaire (CSEQ) for three variables: Quality of Effort, Student Perception of the College Environment, and Student Estimate of Gains. Analysis of CSEQ data found that the treatment group experienced a greater increase in student engagement ranging from 9% to 23% across all three variables. Women and minorities in the treatment group reported improved student engagement over their peers in the control group. Finally, as student diversity increases in collegiate aviation, cooperative learning should prove useful as a tool for improving student engagement.","For decades, the US aviation industry has been dominated by white males, particularly in the ranks of pilots, air traffic controllers and aviation management professionals.

220,2005,PQDT - Global,Developing an Aviation Safety Strategy within the Southern African Context: A Stakeholder Perspective,"Certain new realities, such as the liberalization of the skies and increased air traffic in South Africa are bound to test the existing safety strategies, regulations and maintenance of standards.In order to obtain a picture of the future architecture and the standard of aviation safety in South Africa, the mental models of stakeholders in the industry were investigated in a qualitative, study. A qualitative interpretive research design was followed. The research question was: What are the mental models of key stakeholders in the aviation safety environment and how does this need to be accounted for in the development of an aviation safety strategy, in a Southern African context?In order to obtain a broad spectrum of the social constructs of key stakeholders with regard to aviation safety and to enhance the trustworthiness of the information, three research interventions or information gathering processes were applied. These were the individual interviews through Kelly’s Repertory Grid (Rep Grid) technique, outcomes analysis of the job of a safety manager through a focus group process and a scenario development process (in this sequence). Data was then considered in relation to certain theoretical perspectives, as well as realities in the aviation safety environment in Southern Africa.The study identified pertinent gaps between the mental models elicited from research participants during individual interventions and those elicited during group interventions, as well as a disparity between their mental models and the demands of the aviation safety environment in Southern Africa and the international community. The participants’ individual mental models (or theories in use) focused more on micro systems and symptoms of “unsafely” than the broader systemic relationships and problems. Tendencies towards silo-thinking and single loop learning were indicated.In contrast with the individual mental models, the collective or shared mental models of the participants, elicited during group interventions, represented a more systemic view and a more effective or desired model with regard to aviation safety. The broader system together with its interrelated elements, entropy and unpredictability, as well as critical elements that need to be accounted for in an aviation strategy, were identified. These were, among others, effective coordinated regulation and safety oversight on national and regional level; risk management; international recognition; legitimacy; authorization and market access for airlines; maintenance of standards; international cooperation; and training. It also became clear that safety cannot be understood and managed by focusing on Newtonian laws without a proper appreciation of human factors. Other important perspectives that were identified are the need for the establishment of a study-field for aviation psychology and effective human factors training; as well as the need for a regional regulatory function in Southern Africa.","Certain new realities, such as the liberalization of the skies and increased air traffic in South Africa are bound to test the existing safety strategies, regulations and maintenance of standards.In order to obtain a picture of the future architecture and the standard of aviation safety in South Africa, the mental models of stakeholders in the industry were investigated in a qualitative, study. A qualitative interpretive research design was followed. The research question was: What are the mental models of key stakeholders in the aviation safety environment and how does this need to be accounted for in the development of an aviation safety strategy, in a Southern African context?In order to obtain a broad spectrum of the social constructs of key stakeholders with regard to aviation safety and to enhance the trustworthiness of the information, three research interventions or information gathering processes were applied.","<title>Developing an Aviation Safety Strategy within the Southern African Context: A Stakeholder Perspective</title> <excerpt>Certain new realities, such as the liberalization of the skies and increased air traffic in South Africa are bound to test the existing safety strategies, regulations and maintenance of standards.In order to obtain a picture of the future architecture and the standard of aviation safety in South Africa, the mental models of stakeholders in the industry were investigated in a qualitative, study.

However, SA has been recognized to be of vital importance in information-processing and decision-making in a variety of other occupations. The present study extends the work of previous authors by conducting research on the effect of personality and stress on the SA of workers in a high-intensity job other than aviation. This study developed emergent medical scenarios and the SA requirements for each scenario. Although, this SA measure demonstrated acceptable content validity, it failed to meet reliability requirements. Data regarding SA, stress (physiological and psychological), and personality were collected from nursing school students who were in the junior/senior year in their programs. A randomized experimental design was used to collect data and test the study hypotheses. In addition to participating in the medical scenarios, the participants were also provided with situation awareness training which aimed at improving their situation awareness, contingency planning, communication and teamwork skills, and stress management. Path analysis was used to test the relationships among personality, stress, and SA and the effect of the situation awareness training on these relationships. In accordance with previous research, the study demonstrated that psychological stress was positively associated with personality factors such as neuroticism. However, due to measurement problems with the SA scales and minimal reactivity of the physiological stress measures, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the relationship of SA with either personality or stress (physiological and psychological). Additionally, results also showed that the situation awareness training did not have the hypothesized effect on the stress-SA relationship. This calls into question the model of personality, stress, and SA proposed by the study. However, before the model, or any of its components, is discarded, further analyses should be performed using new or refined SA and stress instruments. Opportunities for future research are discussed in detail and ideas for the improvement of the study design are proposed.","Conventionally, the study of situation awareness (SA) has predominantly been confined to the field of aviation.

To assess and ensure safety, it would be useful to be able to be able to predict the visibility, to a human observer, of an aircraft of specified size, shape, distance, and coloration. Examples include assuring safe separation among aircraft and between aircraft and unmanned vehicles, design of airport control towers, and efforts to enhance or suppress the visibility of military and rescue vehicles. We have recently developed a simple metric of pattern visibility, the Spatial Standard Observer (SSO). In this report we examine whether the SSO can predict visibility of simulated aircraft images. We constructed a set of aircraft images from three-dimensional computer graphic models, and measured the luminance contrast threshold for each image from three human observers. The data were well predicted by the SSO. Finally, we show how to use the SSO to predict visibility range for aircraft of arbitrary size, shape, distance, and coloration.","Visual detection of aircraft by human observers is an important element of aviation safety.

224,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Multimodal Affect Assessment in Aviation Training,"Affect has an impact on learning by influencing various cognitive, psychomotor and motivational processes. This research aims to understand the role of affect in aviation training. We examined participants' (N = 19) affect in simulated aviation training while they perform ten aviation tasks designed to their skill level. Performance was graded with a rubric provided by our collaborator, CAE Inc. Affective states were inferred from two biometric measurements (electrodermal activity, facial expression) and one 'ground truth' measurement (experiential self-report). Convergent results were found among all the data channels: Arousal from facial expression and electrodermal activity correlated positively with each other; Correlations between biometrically inferred affect and self-reported affect correlates (workload, fatigue, effort, perceived control and value) were found and were consistent with past research. These convergent findings support the validity of the measurements. Furthermore, we found that arousal (inferred from electrodermal activity) positively predicted performance in low difficulty task, and that mental workload (as measured from self-report) negatively predicted performance in medium and difficult tasks. We found that emotions did not vary significantly by how well a task was performed.This research adds empirical evidence on the impact of affective states on aviation training performance. Furthermore it addresses a gap in the literature regarding mechanisms to demonstrate convergence between multimodal affect data. This research is a preliminary step to a comprehensive assessment of affect in aviation training, which could eventually help training instructors to allocate appropriate scaffolding to pilots where needed, thereby improving the overall training experience and pilot performance.","Affect has an impact on learning by influencing various cognitive, psychomotor and motivational processes.

225,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A Theory of False Cognitive Expectancies in Airline Pilots,"The Theory of False Cognitive Expectancies was developed by studying high reliability flight operations. Airline pilots depend extensively on cognitive expectancies to perceive, understand, and predict actions and events. Out of 1,363 incident reports submitted by airline pilots to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aviation Safety Reporting System over a year's time, 110 reports were found to contain evidence of 127 false cognitive expectancies in pilots. A comprehensive taxonomy was developed with six categories of interest. The dataset of 127 false expectancies was used to initially code tentative taxon values for each category. Intermediate coding through constant comparative analysis completed the taxonomy. The taxonomy was used for the advanced coding of chronological context-dependent visualizations of expectancy factors, known as strands, which depict the major factors in the creation and propagation of each expectancy. Strands were mapped into common networks to detect highly represented expectancy processes. Theoretical integration established 11 sources of false expectancies, the most common expectancy errors, and those conspicuous factors worthy of future study. The most prevalent source of false cognitive expectancies within the dataset was determined to be unconscious individual modeling based on past events. Integrative analyses also revealed relationships between expectancies and flight deck automation, unresolved discrepancies, and levels of situation awareness. Particularly noteworthy were the findings that false expectancies can combine in three possible permutations to diminish situation awareness and examples of how false expectancies can be unwittingly transmitted from one person to another. The theory resulting from this research can enhance the error coding process used during aircraft line oriented safety audits, lays the foundation for developing expectancy management training programs, and will allow researchers to proffer hypotheses for human testing using flight simulators.","The Theory of False Cognitive Expectancies was developed by studying high reliability flight operations.

Safety cultures should be assessed in order to improve an organization’s state of safety (Adjekum et al., 2015; Cooper, Collins, Bernard, Schwann, & Knox, 2019; Wiegmann, Zhang, von Thaden, Sharma, & Gibbons, 2004). Questionnaires are one of the best ways of obtaining information about an organization’s safety culture (Wiegmann et al., 2004; Wald, Gray, & Eatough, 2018). Additionally, the extent to which aviation hazards are reported (hazreps) serve as an indicator of the health of an aviation Safety Management System (SMS) (Adjekum et al., 2015; Cooper et al., 2019) and as a marker of a proactive safety culture (Gu & Itoh, 2013; Reason, 2008; Reiman & Pietikäinen, 2012). Proactive safety cultures are linked to hazard mitigation amongst aviation organizations (Barach, 2000; Reiman & Pietikäinen, 2012). In light of this, and in an effort to have a proactive safety culture, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) wishes to know the extent of the relationship between its annual Operational Climate Survey (safety survey) and hazreps. The main research question for this thesis is: What is the extent of the relationship between USCG aviation safety survey data and the total of aviation hazards reported? First, an Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted to determine the validity and reliability of the safety survey using data from FY 2015 to FY 2018 (n = 10,622) and to reduce the survey data to clusters of items within factors. The survey was found to be statistically reliable. The averaged survey items within factors represented the survey in order to perform a Pearson’s Correlation procedure between the survey data and hazrep totals per USCG air station (n = 28) per year. In addition, multiple regression procedures were carried out to determine if the safety survey was predictive of the extent to which hazards were reported. This research revealed that there was no statistically significant correlation between the safety survey and hazreps, and consequently, the safety survey was not predictive of hazreps.","Aviation safety outcomes, such as mishaps, are a product of an aviation organization’s safety culture (Reason, 2008; Reiman & Pietikäinen, 2012).

227,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Predictive Relations Between Cognitive Abilities And Pilot Performance: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,"A large body of literature suggests that cognitive abilities are important determinants for training and job performance, including flight performance. The associations between measures of ability tests and job performance have been the focus of many empirical studies, resulting in an overall conclusion that general mental ability, g, is the main source of prediction, while other narrower abilities have limited power for predicting job performance. Despite the attention given to cognitive ability-flight performance relationships, their associations have not been fully understood at the broad construct level, and most extant literature focused on the relations at the observed scores level. Thus, the present dissertation study was designed to contribute to the progression of this understanding by examining the relations between cognitive abilities and flight training performance, using data from four U.S. Air Force (USAF) pilot samples. For comparison, one navigator and one air battle manager sample were also analyzed. The data were obtained from correlation matrices of prior investigations and analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures.Four studies are reported in the thesis: (1) preliminary study, (2) primary validation study, (3) cross-validation study, and (4) cross-occupation validation study. The preliminary study assessed the test battery used in the subsequent predictive studies. The primary validation study introduced a bifactor predictive SEM model for testing the influence of cognitive abilities in predicting pilot performance. The cross-validation study assessed the consistency of the predictive model suggested in the primary validation study, using three additional pilots’ samples. The crossoccupation validation study compared the predictive model using data from three aviation-related occupations (flying, navigation, air battle management). Ability factors were extracted from scores of pilot applicants on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT), the USAF officers’ primary selection test battery, whereas the flight performance scores were obtained from pilot records during the flight training program.In addition to the g factor, verbal ability, quantitative ability, spatial ability, perceptual speed ability, and aviation-related acquired knowledge are the six latent cognitive ability factors investigated in the reported studies. Pilot performance measures were modeled either as observed or latent variables covering ratings of academic and hands-on flying performance in different phases of the training program. The studies of this thesis established that (1) general ability contributes substantially to the prediction models; however, it is not the only important predictor, (2) aviation-related acquired knowledge is the most robust predictor of pilot performance among the abilities examined, with a role even exceeding that of g, (3) perceptual speed predicted pilot performance uniquely in several occasions, while verbal, spatial, and quantitative abilities demonstrated trivial incremental validity for hands-on pilot performance beyond that provided by the g measure, and (4) the relative importance of cognitive abilities tends to vary across aviation occupations.","A large body of literature suggests that cognitive abilities are important determinants for training and job performance, including flight performance.

The risk of flying fighter aircraft is relatively more than that of transport/helicopters where the psychophysiological and physical stresses with limited time in the dynamic environment may impose health risk on chronic basis. Acute stress causes reduction in heart rate variability but chronic stress, such as job stress, may also affect heart rate variability in the long-term. This study was undertaken to assess and compare the heart rate variability between fighters and non-fighter in relation to job stress.Methods.40 healthy male military aircrew (20 each in both the groups) voluntarily participated in this study at this institute. Each subject gave written consent and completed the demographic inventory and the perceived stress scale questionnaire as per protocol followed by complete medical examination to rule out any clinical abnormality. The study was carried out in a quiet comfortable room standardized with environmental settings conducted on the fixed part of the day at 1330 hrs. Each of the subject was made to relax in supine lying posture and ECG was recorded for 30 minutes in computer for future off-line analysis.Results.There was a significant reduction of inter beat interval variation (p=0.003) with significant (p=0.004) lower p NN50 in the fighter group. The normalized units of LF and that of HF was significantly increased (p=0.002) and decreased (p=0.002) respectively in the fighters. The LF/HF Ratio was also found to be significantly higher (p=0.006) in the fighter group.Conclusion.The results confirm the fact that the fighter population seems to have a sympathetic predominance compared to the control group suggested by a higher resting heart rate and a reduced heart rate variability which may induce cardiovascular diseases at a later stage in life because of stress of flying a fighter aircraft. Thus the fighter pilots should be indoctrinated the importance of methods to improve the heart rate variability at this stage which will be beneficial to their health in the long run.","Background.Flying is hazardous with an inherent risk.

231,2018,PLoS One,Shared responsibility for managing fatigue: Hearing the pilots,"In commercial aviation, fatigue is defined as a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, circadian phase, and/or workload. The International Civil Aviation Organisation mandates that responsibility for fatigue risk management is shared between airline management, pilots, and support staff. However, to date, the majority of research relating to fatigue mitigations in long range operations has focused on the mitigations required or recommended by regulators and operators. Little research attention has been paid to the views or operational experience of the pilots who use these (or other) mitigations. This study focused on pilots’ views and experiences of in-flight sleep as the primary fatigue mitigation on long range flights. It also sought information about other fatigue mitigation strategies they use. Thematic analysis was used to explore written comments from diary and survey data collected during long range and ultra-long range trips (N = 291 pilots on three different aircraft types, 17 different out-and-back trips, and four airlines based on three continents). The findings indicate that the recommended fatigue mitigation strategies on long-haul flights (particularly in-flight sleep) are effective and well-utilised, consistent with quantitative findings from the same trips. Importantly however, the analyses also highlight areas that require further investigation, including flight preparation strategies in relation to the uncertainty of in-flight break allocation. There were two strategies for sleep prior to a flight: maximising sleep if pilots were expecting later breaks in the flight; or minimising sleep if they were expecting breaks earlier or at unfavourable times in the circadian cycle. They also provide a broader view of the factors that affect the amount and quality of pilots’ in-flight sleep, about which evidence has previously been largely anecdotal. The study underscores the value of including the views and experience of pilots in fatigue risk management.","In commercial aviation, fatigue is defined as a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, circadian phase, and/or workload.

Literature claimed a degradation of cognate abilities as a person ages. However, literature also showed that older adults can learn like their younger counterparts. The answer then for older adults and their ability to learn advanced and changing technologies must lie deeper than just the loss of cognitive abilities as one ages. The research question for the study was, ""What is the experience of older pilots in training who are transitioning to technically advanced aircraft?” The study employed grounded theory using seven participants answering guided interview questions. The population was pilots who fly for a volunteer organization within the state of New York. Out of a population of 52 pilots, seven participated whose ages were between 40-80 years and went through transition training from basic aircraft cockpits to computerized G1000 models. Data analysis began with guided interview questions along with coding and memoing. The first stage of analysis was the initial coding process, then focus coding, axial coding, and finally theoretical coding. Theoretical coding generated a theory, which pointed to self-efficacy. Self-efficacy along with self-regulated personal learning were motivators for the optimum outcome of reaching goals regardless of age.","Older adults face many challenges in the workplace, one being the advancement of technologies both in hardware and software development.

This qualitative phenomenological research study examined women’s and minority pilots’ experiences through the lens of sociocultural theory and in-depth interviews. This study explored sexual harassment, racism, bias, discrimination, and microaggressions to develop recommendations for aviation organizations to implement diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and create a welcoming industry for all prospective pilots. This study provided an extensive review of the historical role women and minorities have played in aviation and the contributions women and minority pilots have added to the industry. Further, this research explored the historical discrimination and bias women and minority pilots have faced since the inception of the aviation industry. Women and minorities have historically been underrepresented in aviation as the industry is approximately 93% White males. This places women and minority pilots at a disadvantage, both in the industry and in playing a role in diversifying aviation.  The participants in this research provided a glimpse into the challenges they have faced in their careers. Under the sociocultural theory, children often pursue careers they are exposed to at an early age. Girls and minorities often lose interest in pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, including aviation, by age 12. The zone of proximal development suggests that they do not have role models in the field. Several participants interviewed stated that they may not have considered an aviation career had they not been exposed at a young age. Additional barriers noted in this study included the often-prohibitive cost of training to the level at which pilots become employable at airlines or charter positions and the lack of funding opportunities available. This study provided recommendations for reducing sexual or racial harassment, increasing visibility to young girls and minorities, and funding sources. It is hoped that this research will help shed light on the challenges women and minorities in aviation face and will aid in developing initiatives that the aviation industry can employ to diversify the career field.",The problem addressed in this study was the barriers women and minorities face when embarking on careers in aviation. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to investigate the barriers women and ethnic minorities have faced when entering aviation careers to develop initiatives that can be used to increase both gender and ethnic diversity in aviation. This research explored the barriers women and minority pilots face when entering aviation to identify and develop initiatives aviation organizations can use to diversify the industry.,<title>Developing Initiatives to Increase Diversity in Aviation: A Phenomenological Study</title> <excerpt>The problem addressed in this study was the barriers women and minorities face when embarking on careers in aviation.

235,2009,Journal of European Industrial Training,Conflict management styles of Turkish managers,"Purpose - The aim of this study is to determine Turkish managers' conflict styles in different sectors, namely durable consumer goods, aviation, automotive and banking. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 130 managers' conflict management styles were assessed by applying the Rahim's 1983 Organizational Conflict Inventory-II. Findings - First, integrating and, second, compromising are found to be the most preferred conflict styles of Turkish managers. The other important finding is that preferring obliging styles of conflict management changes according to the status of managers. Obliging is mostly used when the conflict partner has an upper level status. Research limitations/implications - Additional data from cross-cultural studies are needed to form a comprehensive understanding of conflict management styles. Also, the number of respondents in the study is not enough to generalize the findings; additional data from different sectors could make the findings more valid. Practical implications - There seems to be a need for seminars or practice-oriented workshops on evaluating and understanding the nature of conflict and learning to manage conflict as a beneficial and creative process for the betterment of both individuals in organizations and organizations themselves. Originality/value - The study provides a revised base for cross-cultural conflict management studies and also highlights the national dynamics of Turkish managers' relationships, especially for international investors.

237,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Executive function and physical performance on flight control devices during exposure to normobaric hypoxia,"Hypoxia is a physiological state defined as a reduction in the distribution of oxygen to the tissues of the body. It has been labeled as a major factor in aviation safety worldwide because of its potential disorientation. Hypoxic symptoms have been found at altitudes ranging up to 12,500 ft.; however, federal regulations allow pilots to operate aircrafts at this altitude without the use of supplemental oxygen. Purpose: To determine the effects of 12,500 ft. on physiology, cognition, and performance in pilots during a flight simulation. Methods: Ten healthy male pilots engaged in three visits including a pre-screening visit and two experimental trials. Each of the trials consisted of a 60 minute baseline period, followed by a 60 minute flight simulation period. The first visit included all baseline anthropometric variables and a graded maximum exercise test using a leg cycle ergometer. The two experimental visits included a 0 ft. normoxic trial (NORM) and a 12,500 ft. hypoxic trial (HYP). Physiological data including heart rate (HR), oxygen utilization (VO2), oxygenation, and blood flow was collected. Also cognitive data including running memory (MEMORY) was collected. Finally, pilot performance data including operational errors (OE), command errors (CE) and total errors (TE) were recorded. Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated a significant (p ≤ 0.05) time by condition interaction for HR, oxygenation, blood flow, and MEMORY. A paired samples t-test demonstrated a non-significant (p ≥ 0.05) difference for OE, CE, and TE between trials. Conclusion: Pilots exhibited physiological and cognitive impairments; however, pilot performance was not affected by HYP.","Hypoxia is a physiological state defined as a reduction in the distribution of oxygen to the tissues of the body.

The purpose of this study was to determine if attributes of pilot performance could be used to differentiate students in a collegiate flight training program. Several pre-entry and flight training attributes were examined to see if any served as predictors of success. A general survey was administered to explore why students may or may not have chosen to remain in the flight training program and/or pursue the certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate. Finally, the Tabular Speed Test© was administered to further understand flight student population characteristics as they pertained to existing aviation selection test batteries.The participants in this study were 242 persons attending a Midwestern post-secondary institution who began and completed the private pilot flight course between the spring of 2010 and fall of 2014. Logistic regression results indicated that it was possible to predict student completion of the multi-engine flight course 73.2% of the time (X2 (7) = 23.349, p < .001). Additionally, there were several significant correlations amongst performance variables which warrant future research, such as the relationship between high school GPA to the private, instrument and commercial flight theory courses (r = .307, n= 199, p = .000, r = .367, n= 103, p = .000, and r = .219, n= 84, p = .045, respectively).

241,2018,PQDT - Global,Development of Normative Data for Personality Characteristics of IAF Fighter Pilots Based on NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R),"Background and objective-Personality assessment of IAF fighter pilots is being performed at the Dept of Aviation Psychology regularly to help in their aero-medical disposal. Personality Inventory Revised NEO PI-R is being administered since a long time for IAF pilots’ personality assessment but the normative data supplied by the developer is of United States general population. Extensive researches have already established that fighter pilots’ personality is different from general population and it comprises of emotional stability, superior motivational levels and high mental order capacities. Therefore understanding the personality characteristics of fighter pilots is important while taking aeromedical decision about flying. In India there is no normative data available as regards to NEO PI-R for personality characteristics of fighter pilot population. The objective of current study is to develop normative data of personality characteristics of IAF fighter pilots based on NEO PI-R.Methodology-The NEO PI-R Form-S was administered to (N=169) volunteer male fighter pilots of IAF and their personality assessment was done. The age of pilots was within a range from 21 to 46 years. The experience in terms of flying hours was also varied, with a range of 10-3750 hours. Only fit and in flying medical category pilots were included in the study. 30% pilots were Flying Officers with less flying experience and 20% of the pilots were Wing Commanders with more flying hours experience. The other demographic data included were types of commissioning, involvement in accident/incident and type of entry. The sample was analyzed with SPSS software, raw scores were converted into z score and further transformed into standardized T scores. Normality of data was ascertained by using Shapiro-Wilk test and skewness and kurtosis of the sample distribution. Internal consistency as measured by Cronbach’s alpha for all the five domains ranged from .6-.8 indicating good reliability.Results-Results obtained on NEO PI-R data denotes the pilots’ mean domain scores ranged from 120 (SD ± 17.4) for Conscientiousness to 78.6 (SD ± 14.7) for Neuroticism. The mean facet scores ranged from 12.62 (SD ± 3.9) for angry hostility to 23.4 (SD ±1.4) for warmth. Tables showing percentile equivalents and T scores were drawn. Comparison of the developed normative data with the data supplied with NEO PI-R was done by One Sample t-test and the findings showed statistically significant difference between two. It supports the need for developing specialized norms with large sample size.Discussion:Analysis of the data suggests that there is statistically significant difference between US general population Norms and IAF fighter pilots’ scores. It is inappropriate to compare the personality of IAF fighter pilots’ personality with the developer’s normative data. Referring to the developed norms will be helpful to be precise while assessing pilots, in particular while evaluating their fitness to fly for resuming flying following any conditions that may have affected their motivational level and emotional stability.","Background and objective-Personality assessment of IAF fighter pilots is being performed at the Dept of Aviation Psychology regularly to help in their aero-medical disposal.

The EPPS was administered to 185 professional pilot candidates enrolled in the professional pilot curriculum at Middle Tennessee State University. Results were used to construct a profile which was compared to the college norm developed by Edwards and to the personality profile previously identified for pilots. The results suggested that, although there were significant differences in the profiles, the degree and direction of these differences were not consistent with that which has previously been identified as the pilot's personality profile. Therefore, the results failed to support the hypothesis that the professional pilot candidates at Middle Tennessee State University would display the pilot's personality profile.","This study explored the existence of the so-called pilot's personality profile in collegiate professional pilot candidates, based on selected factors of the Edwards Personality Preference Schedule (EPPS).

244,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Examining the Relationship between Part 121 Scheduled Overnight Cargo Flight Crewmembers and Maslach Burnout Subscales,"Overnight cargo flight operations have negative physiological and psychological consequences on flight crewmembers, which may lead to fatigue. Flight crewmembers under a high job demand environment manifest a wide variety of fatigue symptoms, which has been highly correlated to the burnout syndrome subscale of exhaustion. The highest levels of burnout occur due to imbalances between high job demands and low job resources. Therefore, variances between low job resources and high job demands of flight crewmembers may be precursors of the burnout syndrome. The purpose of this nonexperimental, quantitative study was to explore relationships between the environmental dimensions of scheduled overnight cargo flight crewmembers performing within Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 121 and the burnout subscales. Data were collected from 558 flight crewmembers. The Wilcoxon tests,  p values (0.000) of flight crewmembers, who experienced role conflict, quantitative work overload, qualitative work overload, autonomy, and organizational politics, indicated there were statistically significant differences in the burnout subscales. In addition, the p values (0.315; 0.82) of flight crewmembers who experienced role ambiguity and fair rewards, respectively, indicated that there was no statistical difference in the level of professional efficacy. Quantitative work overload and organizational politics had the strongest statistically significant correlations with the subscale of exhaustion ( p = .351; p = .312) respectively, as well as, the cynicism subscale (p = .220; p = .302). In addition, qualitative work overload had the weakest positive correlations with all burnout subscales. Recommendations for aviation administrators include readdressing work policies and practices that directly affect the areas of work and rest scheduling parameters, redefining job description responsibilities and duties, improving management and labor relationship while maintaining a fair reward system, and enhancing any internal decision support system utilized by flight crewmembers. Longitudinal research may allow researchers to better understand the impact of the environmental dimensions on burnout over time, while focusing on individual factors, such as demographics. Finally, more research focused on the level of burnout of scheduled overnight cargo flight crewmembers performing under FAR Part 121, unscheduled cargo flight crewmembers, and scheduled airline passenger flight crewmembers, is needed.","Overnight cargo flight operations have negative physiological and psychological consequences on flight crewmembers, which may lead to fatigue.

246,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,After the last flight: Exploring airline pilots' transition to federally mandated retirement,"The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore the retirement experience of airline pilots as they transition to life following mandatory retirement. The voices of twenty pilots provide the essence of their experience. Five broad context theme clusters emerged during analysis of the data accumulated during pre-retirement and post-retirement interviews, including retirement planning, fear of the unknown, post-airline employment decision, I'm not an airline pilot anymore, and  pre-retirement vision versus retirement reality. After retiring from the airline, eighteen of the twenty participants sought new employment, thus the transition was not to a stereotypical retirement. Pre-retirement torpor and fear of the unknown often contributed to the participants' delayed planning of post-retirement activities and the consideration of post-airline employment. Those who did not secure post-airline employment prior to leaving the airline reported feelings of waiting for their next trip or being on vacation for several weeks. This vacation period was followed by a period of boredom, listlessness, and melancholy that lasted between one day and five months. This latter period ended when a decision was made to seek employment, but returned if employment was not immediately secured. Despite an anticipated shortage of pilots, more than 9,000 pilots will be forced to retire at the age of 60 between the years 2007 and 2011. This research has implications for pre-retirement planning and out-placement programs, healthcare providers and insurers, volunteer agencies, educational institutions, mental health counselors, financial planners, and for the development of niche retiree-focused businesses and service organizations.","The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore the retirement experience of airline pilots as they transition to life following mandatory retirement.

247,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"What role does emotional intelligence (EI) play for superior performers in the international business of a capital -intensive, asset-based industry?","In an increasingly competitive global environment, organizations are showing a renewed interest in how individuals create and sustain organizational capabilities for competitive advantage. This study demonstrates that emotional intelligence competencies are critical to the successful planning and execution of international business in a capital-intensive, asset-based industry. The study's population comprised employees whose responsibilities ranged from idea conceptualization to revenue realization, in a capital-intensive, asset-based, international petroleum company. Data were collected from a sample of superior and typical performers in the roles of Strategist, International Business Developer, International Negotiator, International Business Service Manager, and Worldwide Project Manager in a vertically integrated organization. Data collection methods included behavioral event interviews (BEIs), focus groups, and a standardized competency questionnaire. A secondary analysis was conducted of randomly selected interviews to determine the relationship between individual performance and the intrinsic motivation phenomenon of “flow” (optimal experience), often associated with superior performance. An analysis of the data found ten competencies and six unique skills/expertise characteristics related to successful international business activities. Three of the competencies were classified as cognitive (IQ), seven as emotional (EQ), and six unique characteristics as skill/expertise (S/E) competencies. These competencies identified behaviors that, if replicated across the organization, would create an international capability. The study also indicated that flow characteristics were not limited to superior performers but were likely to be experienced by typical performers as well. The strength of the study derives from (a) its foundation across a series of responsibilities that create a valued capability, (b) an empirical data collection process, which minimized personal bias in the identification of differentiating competencies, and (c) a standardized database to identify, measure, and assess the competencies. Its contribution to the discipline is to clarify the role of emotional intelligence in critical functions by substantiating the interpersonal contributions of EQ competencies in creating specific organizational capabilities. These competencies describe behaviors that provide the sense of direction, self-confidence, and means to leverage other capabilities to influence outcomes in a way that is personally satisfying and organizationally valued. The hidden value of EQ is that it provides a foundation for performance, which itself evolves from achievement and socialized power motives.","In an increasingly competitive global environment, organizations are showing a renewed interest in how individuals create and sustain organizational capabilities for competitive advantage.

248,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Examining operational errors in the National Airspace System using temporal marker framework,"In air traffic control, an operational error is a loss of separation between two aircraft where the air traffic controller is at fault. Operational errors progress in a chain-like sequence of events. The evolution of an operational error can be studied using a progression system called temporal marker framework and can assist in identifying trends and lead to mitigation policies. Air traffic control error progression has not been previously studied with a large sample. This research used a quantitative correlational analysis of Temporal Marker Time Spans (TMTS), the time difference between the temporal marker categories occurring during an operational error, to determine any significant statistical association between the TMTS by workload as measured by the number of aircraft on the sector at the time of the error. Seventy-three errors were discarded because of audio and visual quality problems and two because they were not procedural errors. The final sample consisted of 334 en-route operational errors. Terminal Radar Approach Control operational errors were not available for download. Errors occurring in the control tower environment were not examined because the Temporal Marker Framework system was designed solely for operational errors in the radar environment. The research questions postulated whether the progression of the operation error, as measured by the TMTS, would be affected by controller workload as measured by the number of aircraft in the sector at the time of the error. None of the TMTS research questions resulted in a statistically significant correlation between any of the TMTS studied and the number of aircraft in the sector at the time of the error. The lack of statistical significance suggests that either other variables are potentially contributory or additional TMTS might need to be studied. Additionally, it was theorized that the progression could be dependent on past events based upon extrapolation from the present. It was further conjectured that the situation as it was unfolding and the reactions of the involved controller could affect the progression of the operational error. Future research should include a better sample of working SATORI re-creations, other variables and statistical methodologies, terminal OEs, and additional TMTS.","In air traffic control, an operational error is a loss of separation between two aircraft where the air traffic controller is at fault.

249,2023,Cureus,Determining the Best Approach: Comparing and Contrasting the Impact of Different Coping Strategies on Work-Related Stress and Burnout Among Saudi Commercial Pilots,"BackgroundMany physiological, psychological, and environmental stressors can be experienced by pilots throughout their careers, which may affect their mental and psychological health and their performance consequently. Stressing factors of aviation and commercial operations can result in pilots’ burnout, which is a description of the response to chronic emotional exhaustion and loss of motivation.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout and compare the effects of different coping strategies on burnout levels among commercial pilots in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2023MethodsThe study was a cross-sectional survey utilizing an online form of a validated questionnaire administered to pilots of Saudi commercial airlines in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study targeted on-duty Saudi commercial pilots, excluding retired and in-training pilots, with an estimated population of around 2000. A sample size of 311 was determined using an equation considering a 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level, and a 60.3% burnout prevalence rate. Non-probability snowball sampling method was used to achieve sample size.ResultsA total of 321 pilots were included, mostly Saudis. The participants had a median age of 47, and the majority were married with one to two children. BMI classifications showed high percentages of overweight and obese individuals. The study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout (70.1%). Nationality, marital status, and shorter sleeping duration were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. Common challenges included long duties (79.4%), irregular working hours (72.3%), and time away from home (55.5%). Coping strategies included rest and sleep (81%), exercise (59.2%), and relaxation behaviors (50.5%). Stressors such as long duties, irregular working hours, and work conflicts were significantly associated with higher burnout levels. However, no significant associations were found between coping strategies and burnout levels.ConclusionThe study found that most pilots experienced medium levels of burnout. In addition, common challenges included long duties, irregular working hours, and time away from home. The study emphasizes the need to address work-related stressors, implement interventions, and support pilots' mental health. Promoting healthy coping strategies and understanding individual resilience is important. Further research and organizational efforts are required to mitigate burnout and enhance the quality of life for aviation professionals, benefiting both individuals and the industry.","BackgroundMany physiological, psychological, and environmental stressors can be experienced by pilots throughout their careers, which may affect their mental and psychological health and their performance consequently.

250,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Human Error Assessment in Software Engineering,"Software engineers work under strict constraints, balancing a complex, multi-phase development process on top of user support and professional development. Despite their best efforts, software engineers experience human errors, which manifest as software defects. While some defects are simple bugs, others can be costly security vulnerabilities. Practices such as defect tracking and vulnerability disclosure help software engineers reflect on the outcomes of their human errors (i.e. software failures), and even the faults that led to those failures, but not the underlying human behaviors. While human error theory from psychology research has been studied and applied to medical, industrial, and aviation accidents, researchers are only beginning to systematically reflect on software engineers’ human errors. Some software engineering research has used human error theories from psychology to help developers identify and organize their human errors (mistakes) during requirements engineering activities, but developers need an improved and systematic way to reflect on their human errors during other phases of software development. The goal of this dissertation is to help software engineers confront and reflect on their human errors by creating a process to document, organize, and analyze human errors. To that end, our research comprises three phases: (1) systematization (i.e. identification and taxonomization) of software engineers’ human errors from literature and development artifacts into a Taxonomy of Human Errors in Software Engineering (T.H.E.S.E.), (2) evaluation and refinement of T.H.E.S.E. based on software engineers’ perceptions and natural language insights, and (3) creation of a human error informed micro post-mortem process and the Human Error Reflection Engine (H.E.R.E.), a proof-of-concept GitHub workflow facilitating human error reflection. In demonstrating the utility of T.H.E.S.E. and our micro post-mortem process, the software development community will be closer to inculcating the wisdom of historical developer human errors, enabling them to engineer higher quality and more secure software.","Software engineers work under strict constraints, balancing a complex, multi-phase development process on top of user support and professional development.

252,2015,PQDT - Global,Challenges of Aviation Security Regulation in Norwegian Post 9/11,"The 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA had wide-ranging consequences for security issues in Western societies. Within civil aviation, the attacks became grim evidence that the security system constructed to prevent intentional attacks was deficient. In Europe, the European Union took on the responsibility to gather European civil aviation security under one banner, relieving the EU members’ national legislation on aviation security, uniting it through implementing one common supranational regulation for all EU countries.As a non-EU member, Norway was obligated by the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA Agreement) to implement the same regulations as the EU countries to avoid being banned from the One-Stop Security regime that had been in effect prior to the 9/11 attacks. The bearing principle in the OneStop Security regime is that any passenger who is security screened at any entry point within the system will forego any new screenings whilst travelling within the system. Therefore, every airport participating in this system must, regardless of size, implement measures that ensure that the EU regulative level is maintained at the same predefined level. In order to achieve this, a highly prescriptive regulation was developed, based on main documents from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) that had previously been applied as guiding documents for the national civil aviation regulations and legislation. These documents had previously provided recommendations that each country was only obliged to report deviations from, but after 9/11 these became mandatory in the new EU regulation. This thesis aims at describing the consequences of this regulatory transition by investigating the following research problem: “What are the consequences of implementing EU security regulation in the Norwegian civil aviation system?”The main aim is, thus, to discover possible consequences of the regulatory system instated post 9/11, both on the authority and airport levels, connecting regulatory types to organisational challenges. In order to study these issues, a charting of the Norwegian civil aviation system and the regulatory landscape was performed by interviewing the main actors and authorities within Norwegian civil aviation. Thereafter, fieldworks were conducted at three different sized airports. In addition, to understand the findings of the Norwegian implementation, a comparative case was made by conducting interviews with key actors in the Icelandic civil aviation system. This comparison was intriguing since Iceland, like Norway, is obligated through the EEA Agreement, yet Iceland chose a different implementation than Norway. Airport security can be defined as a High Reliability Organisation (HRO), as defined by Weick et al. (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 1999, p. 90). These are organisations that operate in a highly unforgiving environment which, in case of errors, has the potential for disastrous outcomes. As security is threatened by different kinds of risks than those with which HRO theory and literature normally have been occupied, I argue that this has less importance when the purpose is to investigate which factors produce reliable outcomes in organisations, regardless of whether the threats are intentionally caused (security) or accidentally caused (safety). Thus, studies on security can be profitably incorporated into the vast literature on organisational safety and reliability. The findings from this study reveal a high degree of constraint at the airport level, both among leaders and employees, caused by the construction of the security regulation and its implementation. Possibilities for action, through influence and involvement in regulatory processes, decreased exponentially with the increase in details and prescription after 9/11. Possibilities for action, or ‘space for action’ as it has been labelled in this thesis, is what facilitates the organisation to adapt and adjust regulation into the context. Seen in relation to HRO principles, limited possibilities for action may lead to mindlessness and, thus, threaten the overall reliability in an organisation. Consequences will necessarily follow a groundbreaking event like what occurred on 9/11. Not only did the security system demonstrate its limitations, but the symbolic value was also high. Consequently, this will affect people’s perception of the trustworthiness of the system. Authoritative action will be essential, and speed will demonstrate vigour. The regulatory work inaugurated in the hours following the terrorist act on 9/11 has unquestionably heightened the security level for civil aviation. However, more than a decade later, it is possible to explore the transition in hindsight to see its consequences in the actual context of the airport. ","The 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA had wide-ranging consequences for security issues in Western societies.

253,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The influence of career identity and social networks on career transition magnitude,"Increasingly, scholars and journalists are suggesting that there is a trend toward greater magnitude in career transitions signified by the crossing of career boundaries (such as level, functional, organizational, industry and professional boundaries). To date, much of the quantitative empirical research suggests that organizational, relational and environmental factors influence career transition behavior. However, while we know that these external influences may cause an individual to transition, we know less about the process through which career transitions evolve, especially those of larger magnitude and how forces internal to the individual may help to explain variance above and beyond these external factors. In this dissertation, I use qualitative and quantitative methodologies to develop and refine a model of career transition focusing on career transition magnitude. Specifically, I use research from social identity, social networks and role exit theory to develop a model of career transition magnitude that posits career identity (the cognitive representation of the self derived from past career experiences, beliefs, values, attributes and motives that define the individual in terms of their career) and network characteristics (the pattern of interpersonal relationships) influence the magnitude of intended career transition, the career exit behaviors one engages in and the evaluation of career opportunities. Further, I use path analysis to find that career exit behaviors are influenced by the magnitude of the intended career transition as well as strong coworker ties and social and personal turbulence. Additionally, I find that the favorable evaluation of career transition opportunities is impacted by career identity centrality and organizational satisfaction. Finally, I find that the magnitude of the intended career transition is influenced by the favorable evaluation of transition opportunities, network career range, organizational satisfaction and social and personal turbulence. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.","Increasingly, scholars and journalists are suggesting that there is a trend toward greater magnitude in career transitions signified by the crossing of career boundaries (such as level, functional, organizational, industry and professional boundaries).

In a similar fashion, as leaders of learning, professors should follow the precepts of educational psychology to inspire students to deeply learn the course material. A student who is made passionate about learning a topic will fill his or her own bucket with greater expedience and efficiency than any professor can. This is a testament to the virtues of intrinsic, versus extrinsic, motivation. An optimal learning environment can be crafted, first, by providing a setting for academic success. A savvy professor can then design the course assessment scheme around harnessing student desires for autonomy. Role modeling can be integrated into the curriculum to shape student attitude and behavior. In similar fashion, an overall reinforcement plan can be instituted to reward appropriate student behavior. Following these tenets, educators can make learning an autotelic event that it is a self-contained activity, pursue by students not just for a good grade, but for the sake of learning itself (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).","The famous French aviator, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, commented about leadership by saying, ""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the sea.""

Such resources affect how we cope with stress and a sense of threat. The authors of this paper focus on people employed in the aviation sector, who work in the hard-to-cope environment of full automation, demanding working conditions and numerous stressors. The presented study fills a gap in the research on the psychological characteristics of the aviation sector. Moreover, a sense of stress/threat is described in the context of the high specificity of employees representing the 4.0 sector. Therefore, it provides additional insights into the psychological functioning of the employees in the aviation sector. The results show that both positive orientation and ego resilience might be seen as protective factors against a sense of threat and stress, while a type D personality is a risk factor of a higher level of those psychological states. The novelty of the presented research concerns a better understanding of the sense of stress/threat experienced by the employees in this sector, as well as verifying the relationships between psychological variables described in the literature as personal resources.","Nowadays, taking into account the multidimensionality of the external environment and necessity of the sustainable development of human resources, organizations are obliged to take more care of the psychological resources of their employees, eg, positive orientation, ego resilience, and emotional stability.

257,2018,PLoS One,Does effective gaze behavior lead to enhanced performance in a complex error-detection cockpit task?,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between expertise, performance, and gaze behavior in a complex error-detection cockpit task. Twenty-four pilots and 26 non-pilots viewed video-clips from a pilot’s viewpoint and were asked to detect malfunctions in the cockpit instrument panel. Compared to non-pilots, pilots detected more malfunctioning instruments, had shorter dwell times on the instruments, made more transitions, visited task-relevant areas more often, and dwelled longer on the areas between the instruments. These results provide evidence for three theories that explain underlying processes for expert performance: The long-term working memory theory, the information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception. In addition, the results for generic attentional skills indicated a higher capability to switch between global and local information processing in pilots compared to non-pilots. Taken together, the results suggest that gaze behavior as well as other generic skills may provide important information concerning underlying processes that can explain successful performance during flight in expert pilots.","The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between expertise, performance, and gaze behavior in a complex error-detection cockpit task.

258,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A measurement of ethical behavior of student pilots in U.S. higher education institutions and their affinity to abide by Federal Aviation Regulations,"The purpose of this study was to explore whether teaching formal ethics courses in an aviation professional pilot curriculum would have an impact on modifying student ethical behavior. Pre and posttest surveys were administered at the start and end of an ethics course, and the frequency of self-reported behaviors of ethical conduct, ethical beliefs, academic conduct, academic honesty beliefs, neutralization behavior, normalization of deviance, and type of flight training predicting students' affinities to abide by Federal Aviation Regulations was analyzed. Although the posttest data from this study revealed negative changes in student ethical behavior, the study revealed a significant positive difference in students' ethical beliefs indicating that ethics courses were successful in helping the students conceptualize ethical beliefs. Furthermore, the results indicated that students' ethical behavior had deteriorated. It is possible to suggest that this deterioration was caused by increased student understanding of ethical behavior, which caused them to report these unethical behaviors more accurately on the posttest survey. Students' ethical beliefs made the strongest unique contribution in predicting student pilots' affinity to abide by FARs. The second strongest unique contribution was normalization of deviance. Students' type of flight program had the smallest contribution to predicting the affinity to abide by FARs. Ethical conduct, academic conduct, academic honesty beliefs, and normalization behavior had no predictive value of students' affinity to abide by FARs.","The purpose of this study was to explore whether teaching formal ethics courses in an aviation professional pilot curriculum would have an impact on modifying student ethical behavior.

Only cursory attention has been given to how these three constructs interact despite the possible clinical and research implications of those associations.

This study investigated the underlying components of PR, their correlations with FAA, and the effect that participants’ depressive status had upon those correlations in a community sample of 54 males and 46 females aged between 18 yr and 75 years. Results confirmed the overall inverse association between total PR and depression for four of the original five PR components and for one of the two components found in this sample. Similarly, there were differences between the ways that FAA and PR components were associated, depending upon the depressive status of participants. Source localisation data indicated that the PR components were not uniformly correlated with alpha activity in the same brain regions. These findings of content, efficacy, and neurophysiological differences between the five components of PR and their associations with FAA argue against consideration of PR as a unitary construct.","Depression is associated with frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and Psychological Resilience (PR), although in different ways.

264,2018,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Ride of a Lifetime: A Netnographic Research to Unveil the Leisure Experience Attached to Orbital Space Tourism,"People tend to have different motivations when selecting a travel destination. While traveling to space becomes increasingly feasible as the technology advances, there is relatively few research communicates what people can experience about leisure travel in space. Understanding the leisure properties of space travel could potentially help the business development of space tourism. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to explore the following: When people travel to outer space, what properties of leisure experiences attached to orbital space tourism could potentially attract tourists? In this study, leisure perception serves as the theoretical foundation; the theory of a multi-phase experience provides an analytical tool to construct the experience of space tourism. A netnographic research method is applied to obtain authentic descriptions about space travel experience from the most popular Tweets posted by 36 NASA astronauts in Twitter.  The selected 3,468 Tweets indicate that the public shows interests in both in-space and off-site experiences. Moreover, research findings highlight the trip to space as a dynamic and multi-phasic experience with its context. Specifically, the identified key patterns, including training, liftoff, in-space, reentry, and memory, are formed into five stages of orbital space travel. Each stage has its unforgettable experiences and unique leisure attributes. This study hopes to fill the gap in current academic literatures of space tourism, and lay the foundation for formulating marketing strategies for space tourism business. Therefore, people do not have to be fully competent as professional astronauts to desire space travel in the future. Instead, a space tourist as amateur astronaut can expect her space trip with multi-phasic leisure experiences as the ride of a lifetime.","People tend to have different motivations when selecting a travel destination. While traveling to space becomes increasingly feasible as the technology advances, there is relatively few research communicates what people can experience about leisure travel in space. Understanding the leisure properties of space travel could potentially help the business development of space tourism.","<title>Ride of a Lifetime: A Netnographic Research to Unveil the Leisure Experience Attached to Orbital Space Tourism</title> <excerpt>People tend to have different motivations when selecting a travel destination.

266,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,An exploration of workplace preparedness for the spectrum of critical incidents: Business preparedness for the human factor in a variety of emergencies,"This research is based on a questionnaire that surveyed businesses in Maine with regard to participants' knowledge of critical incident preparedness plans at their workplace. The design of this study was a questionnaire with one open ended question for qualitative data and statistical analysis of the remainder of the questions. The analysis used a correlational methodology comparing the relationship between the understanding of their company's plan and several variables (knowledge of the plan compared to gender, age, and time with company and history of exposure). All types of employers may be affected by workplace downsizing, violence, and terrorism. It is important to understand the human-related, negative consequences that can occur in the aftermath of a critical incident. Crisis Care Network and International Critical Incident Stress Foundation are two organizations that are available for critical incident training and preparation of critical incident plans. The results indicated that participating businesses are prepared for evacuation; however, none of the surveyed workplaces appeared to be prepared for the spectrum of critical incidents. A recommendation drawn from this research is to involve all employees, giving each a role in the preparedness plans of their workplace. This will enable each employee a greater understanding and a larger degree of participation during a critical incident. This study concludes that a majority of the participants indicated there was no plan at their workplace. Therefore there should be more focus on encouraging businesses to develop plans.","This research is based on a questionnaire that surveyed businesses in Maine with regard to participants' knowledge of critical incident preparedness plans at their workplace.

267,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"General Aviation Airport Runway Incursions: A Qualitative Approach to Examining Reasons for, Barriers to Addressing, and Lessons Learned from Airport Managers’ First-Hand Experiences","The purpose of the study was manifold: (a) to understand the reasons for runway incursions (RIs) at general aviation (GA) airports, (b) to describe the barriers to addressing runway incursions at GA airports, and (c) to describe the lessons learned from addressing runway incursions at GA airports. This study was based primarily on a phenomenological research design, which led to a set of inductively derived conjectures. The study’s sample consisted of 10 GA airports that had at least 10 times the number of GA operations than the number of air carrier (commercial) operations as reported in the Air Traffic Activity Data System (ATADS) across five Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regions (Alaskan, Southwest, Northwest Mountain, Southern, and Western Pacific). Using the FAA’s Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) database, it was reported that these 10 GA airports experienced the highest frequency of pilot deviations (PDs), and vehicle/pedestrian deviations (V/PDs) runway incursions events that had occurred over the last 7.5 years (January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2017). Using the qualitative data analysis software tool, Nvivo©, and Spradley’s (1979) approach, the data were organized into three domains, which corresponded to the three research questions (RQs). The results of data analysis led to the development of common themes and patterns (the phenomenological design component), and these common themes and patterns then served as the basis for formulating corresponding conjectures (the first stage of grounded theory design). The findings suggest that there are numerous reasons that contribute to RIs at GA airports such as compromised situation awareness (SA) and communication, airfield access, resource related issues, and attention to reporting RIs. The barriers faced included airfield infrastructure, and pilot related issues; and the lessons learned were that collaborative communication, and modified physical environments can mitigate the occurrences of RIs. The findings are beneficial to airport managers in that it provided a succinct synthesis of RI mitigation information, for some of which can be implemented in the interim, while providing recommendations for what can be done long term to improve aviation safety.","The purpose of the study was manifold: (a) to understand the reasons for runway incursions (RIs) at general aviation (GA) airports, (b) to describe the barriers to addressing runway incursions at GA airports, and (c) to describe the lessons learned from addressing runway incursions at GA airports.

268,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Air travel in the U.S.: An investigation of the influence of perceived risk in service quality,"This quantitative investigation explored the influence of perceived risk on the service quality of air travel in the United States. The research examined whether perceived risk influences the service expectation and perception gaps that may exist for both business and non-business air travelers relative to their perceived service quality. Service quality was used as a measure of customer satisfaction. It was concluded that regardless of air traveler type, there exists the influence of perceived risk. The air traveler’s travel purpose and service quality were found to be correlated. Significantly, perceived risk and perceived service quality were found to be negatively correlated: As perceived risk increases, the perceived service quality decreases for each of the five dimensions of service quality. The negative correlation however is moderate. The study is consistent with earlier research on “sudden negative events”. It validates the correlation between certain elements of risk (financial, performance, physical, psychological, social and political), and service quality dimensions of Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy. It empirically reveals the gap between the perceived importance of a risk element and the perceived recurrence of that risk in the foreseeable future. It further validates the use of service quality as a measure of customer satisfaction. This research potentially provides guidance for management to enhance processes that can maximize service quality in U.S. air travel. Not only should management do its utmost to increase air traveler satisfaction, it should not ignore the influence of perceived risk on perceived service quality.

269,2023,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),"Beyond performance: the role of task demand, effort, and individual differences in ab initio pilots","Aviation safety depends on the skill and expertise of pilots to meet the task demands of flying an aircraft in an effective and efficient manner. During flight training, students may respond differently to imposed task demands based on individual differences in capacity, physiological arousal, and effort. To ensure that pilots achieve a common desired level of expertise, training programs should account for individual differences to optimize pilot performance. This study investigates the relationship between task performance and physiological correlates of effort in ab initio pilots. Twenty-four participants conducted a flight simulator task with three difficulty levels and were asked to rate their perceived demand and effort using the NASA TLX. We recorded heart rate, EEG brain activity, and pupil size to assess changes in the participants’ mental and physiological states across different task demands. We found that, despite group-level correlations between performance error and physiological responses, individual differences in physiological responses to task demands reflected different levels of participant effort and task efficiency. These findings suggest that physiological monitoring of student pilots might provide beneficial insights to flight instructors to optimize pilot training at the individual level.","Aviation safety depends on the skill and expertise of pilots to meet the task demands of flying an aircraft in an effective and efficient manner.

270,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Assertiveness and Aggressiveness as Predictors of Aviation Safety Attitudes in Military Pilots,"There is a delicate balance that exists between effective assertiveness and unsafe aggressiveness during flight operations. Minimal research has examined if or to what extent personality traits of assertiveness and aggressiveness relate to aviation safety attitudes in military pilots. The purpose of this quantitative correlational research was to develop an understanding whether personality traits of assertiveness and aggressiveness predict aviation safety attitudes of self-confidence, risk orientation, and safety orientation in U.S. Military Pilots. A convenience sample of 132 current and former U.S. Military Pilots from across the country and every branch of service responded to an 81-item online survey that contained personality measures of assertiveness and aggression, an aviation safety attitude measure, and demographic questions. Preliminary Pearson r correlations found that overall trait aggression correlated with the aviation safety attitude among current and former military pilots. A linear regression analysis confirmed overall trait aggression as a possible predictor of the aviation safety attitude of risk orientation, F(1, 130) = 4.344, p = .039 (R2 = .032). Evaluated at the corrected level of statistical significance used in this study (α = .0056), these results are not statistically significant, but they indicate the possibility of a statistically significant predictive relationship in further research with larger samples. Although inconclusive, the findings of this study justify more research in this problem area. This study highlighted instrument reliability problems, the importance of accurately measuring pilot safety attitudes, and the urgent need to develop a new safety attitudes instrument with stronger internal consistency.","There is a delicate balance that exists between effective assertiveness and unsafe aggressiveness during flight operations.

Research shows resilience competencies are particularly emphasized as essential companions to technical skills among workers in these high-consequence industries, and are viewed as critical predictors and determinants of early career success. However, literature also suggests a growing gap in adequate resilience competency preparation and transfer from academic into professional settings. It is essential for both educator and learner therefore to more precisely identify and engage specific resilience skills. This cross-sectional study examined attitudes and practice of key resilience skills of students in university/collegiate aviation programs during problem-based coursework. A five-point Likert survey instrument was used to evaluate participant levels of agreement and self-reported levels of engagement in resilience behaviors. Exploratory Analysis compared participant data against a resilience competency model developed for this study. These factors include: Adversity Persistence, Contextual Awareness, Self-Directed/Autonomy, Change Management, and Social/Peer Relational Connectivity. A refined resilience competency model emerged from the data that will be used to develop a more effective approach to teaching and applied learning strategies for the practice and transfer of essential resilience competencies into the industry.

272,2021,PQDT - Global,Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Psychological Stress Factors in the Cockpit,"According to the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing, human error is the key factor in approximately 80 percent of all aircraft accidents (Boeing, 2008). Often, difficult life circumstances lead to so-called life stress, which has a significant impact on the cognitive performance of pilots. However, stressful situations such as flying through severe weather or system failures can also lead to cognitive impairments. Due to the constant changes of measures, the unstable aviation industry and the irregular schedules for pilots, it is hypothesized that the increased stress caused by the new situation could influence the safety. This thesis therefore investigates how psychological stress factors in the cockpit influence the safety of flights and to what extent are these factors aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. To be able to measure the changes, incident reports from the anonymous reporting tool ASRS of the U.S. aerospace agency NASA were examined. The study found that there was a trend shift in stressors and errors committed, but no aggravation could be detected with the available data.","According to the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing, human error is the key factor in approximately 80 percent of all aircraft accidents (Boeing, 2008).

273,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Mitigating Risk Tolerance Among General Aviation Pilots: Identifying Factors That Contribute to GA Pilots’ Risk Perception,"The purpose of this study was to identify factors that contributed to general aviation (GA) pilots’ level of risk perception, which could then be manifested as an increase in risk tolerance. The study used an explanatory correlational design to determine what factors were related to risk perception. Research factors included gender, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education level, flight hours, single- and multi-engine hours, hours as PIC, type of flight training, number of FAA licenses/ratings, number of hazardous events pilots were involved in, self-efficacy, aviation safety attitudes, level of psychological distress, and locus of control. The dependent variable was risk perception. Predictors were partitioned into three sets, A = Demographics, B = Flight Experience, and C = Affective Domain, and the sample consisted of 93 GA pilots. Participants were solicited from member institutions of the University Aviation Association. A hierarchical regression analysis with set entry order A-B-C found no significant factors at the first two stages, including corresponding increments. When the Affective Domain entered the analysis, age, number of hazardous events, and locus of control had a significant relationship with risk perception. Age had a direct relationship, hazardous events had an indirect relationship, and locus of control had a positive relationship. The increment of the Affective Domain also was significant, and an independent follow-up analysis revealed psychological distress had a significant and direct relationship with risk perception. An independent mediation analysis also found the number of hazardous events was partially mediated by psychological distress, and this mediation reduced the effect of hazardous events on risk perception. The findings of the study did not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute Bandura’s (1977) self-efficacy theory, partially supported Ajzen’s (1992) theory of planned behavior with respect to locus of control, and supported habituated action theory. The study’s findings provided compelling evidence that the affective domain, particularly aviation safety attitudes, psychological distress, and locus of control, is important to understanding GA pilots’ level of risk perception.","The purpose of this study was to identify factors that contributed to general aviation (GA) pilots’ level of risk perception, which could then be manifested as an increase in risk tolerance.

275,2018,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,Investigating Neural Sensorimotor Mechanisms Underlying Flight Expertise in Pilots: Preliminary Data From an EEG Study,"Over the last decade, the efforts towards unraveling the complex interplay between the brain, body, and environment have set a promising line of research that utilizes neuroscience to study human performance in natural work contexts such as aviation. Thus, a new discipline called neuroergonomics is holding the promise of studying the neural mechanisms underlying human performance in pursuit of both theoretical and practical insights. In this work, we utilized a neuroergonomic approach by combining insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition to study flight expertise. Specifically, we focused on the Mirror Neuron system as a key correlate for understanding the interaction between an individual and the environment, suggesting that it can be used to index changes in the coupling of perception-action associated with skill development.In this study, we measured the EEG mu suppression as a proxy of the Mirror Neuron system in experts (pilots) and novices while performing a distance estimation task in a landing scenario. To survey the specificity of this measure, we considered central, parietal and occipital electrode pools and analyzed alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-25 Hz) rhythm bands. We hypothesized that in experts vs. novices, specific neural sensorimotor brain activity would underpin the connection between perception and action in an in-flight context. Preliminary results indicate that alpha and beta suppression was area-specific irrespective of groups, present in the central electrodes placed over the motor areas. Group analysis revealed that specifically alpha mu rhythm, but not beta, was significantly more suppressed in pilots vs. novices. Complementing these findings we found a trend in which the strength of mu suppression increased with the sense of presence experienced by the pilots. Such sensorimotor activation is in line with the idea that for a pilot, a distance judgment is intimately associated with the function of landing. This reflects the ability to use optical invariants to see the world in terms of the capabilities of the aircraft (e.g., reachability and glide angle).These preliminary findings support the role of embodied simulation mechanisms in visual perception and add important insights into a practical understanding of flight expertise, suggesting sensorimotor mechanisms as potential neuro-markers.","Over the last decade, the efforts towards unraveling the complex interplay between the brain, body, and environment have set a promising line of research that utilizes neuroscience to study human performance in natural work contexts such as aviation.

276,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A Comparison of Pilot Upset Recovery Performance in Simulation and Flight,"Loss of control in-flight (LOC-I) has historically been the leading cause of commercial airline fatalities. In 2009, an investigation of LOC-I accidents revealed four primary causal factors, citing human factors errors as one of the factors. The investigation discovered that one reason for the human errors was due to deficiencies in pilot training from aircraft stalls and upsets. These deficiencies led the FAA and similar international organizations to implement upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT) guidelines for commercial air transport aircraft.The aviation industry uses flight simulators as part of a comprehensive program for pilot training and certification requirements. Although flight simulators can possess a high level of realism, deficiencies remain. Many pilots find simulators to be easier than their real-world counterparts. Even with a high-fidelity FFS, simulator training currently cannot accurately reproduce essential factors that are considered to be within the safety margins of the aircraft, such as roll and pitch rates and g-loading, all of which can lead to high levels of altitude loss, if not managed correctly.This thesis compared upset recovery maneuvers between a simulator and live flight. The study used in the research required the pilots to recover from an upset condition while also performing an additional task of serially adding two numbers. The secondary task provided a physiological baseline cognitive workload measurement that was used to compare the pilots’ increased workload levels during the recovery phase of the flight.The results indicated that the pilots generally performed better during the simulator flights and had less subjective workload and high levels of situation awareness. The physiological-based workload contrasted subjective measures. However, during a live flight upset recovery, pilots may not be able to transfer the skills acquired from a flight simulator and experience higher levels of workload and reduced levels of situation awareness, increasing their potential for an unsuccessful recovery. Suggestions are made that include more use of live aircraft aerobatic training for UPRT and the use of a physiological-based, unbiased workload assessment during pilot training. Additionally, it is suggested using an adaptive training approach to UPRT that incorporates the primary technical flight performance metrics with secondary task performance.","Loss of control in-flight (LOC-I) has historically been the leading cause of commercial airline fatalities.

This study investigates how personality traits, as defined by the Big Five Inventory (BFI), influence perceived threats from cabin service robots, with a novel focus on role-dependent differences between passengers and flight attendants. A dual-role survey was administered to 497 participants, who completed the BFI and then evaluated realistic threats (e.g., job displacement, safety risks) and identity threats (e.g., erosion of human roles) posed by cabin service robots, assuming both passenger and flight attendant roles. This study revealed significant role-modulated associations: When acting as flight attendants, higher neuroticism (N) correlated with elevated realistic threats and identity threats, while higher agreeableness (A) predicted reduced realistic threats. In the passenger role, only the negative association between agreeableness and realistic threats persisted. No gender-based differences in perceived threats emerged across roles. The study advances social robotics literature by (1) demonstrating the dual-role paradigm's utility in disentangling human-robot interaction dynamics and (2) identifying neuroticism as a pivotal trait in threat perception within high-responsibility service roles.

Aviation repair technician decision-making perceptions influence aviation safety. The purpose of transcendental phenomenological study was to explore the lived experiences of aviation repair technicians related to decision-making perceptions regarding aviation safety. The central research question and sub-question focused on the lived experiences of repair technicians’ decision-making perceptions. The naturalistic decision-making framework, decision theories, and decision-making models comprised the lens to assess the impact of aviation maintenance technician decision-making perceptions in aviation safety. Data were collected using semistructured interviews with 12 aviation repair technicians in a maintenance repair and overhaul facility. Transcribed interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Five themes emerged: decision-making experience, decision-making application, importance of decision-making, technician job experience, and decision-making influence. Four subthemes also emerged: situational awareness, aviation hazards, aviation safety, and personal safety. Recommendations for future studies include conducting the study in aviation repair facilities abroad and specifically targeting female aviation technicians for comparison and studying the effectiveness of current training and safety programs. Aviation leadership and federal agencies can use the findings of this study to create social change at policy and organizational levels to mitigate accidents, aircraft damage, and personnel injuries.",Aircraft accidents caused by human decision-making errors cause property loss and fatalities on a global scale in the aviation industry.

280,2023,PQDT - Global,"The Relationship Between Avoidance Motivation and Willingness to Fly During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Mediating Role of Perceived Travel Risk, Severity and Susceptibility","The COVID-19 pandemic affects the airline transportation industry in all aspects. Flights have almost come to a standstill due to the restrictions, and the number of passengers on flights that started with the new normal and the easing of the restrictions remained below the previous years. Thus, a survey has been conducted to understand how peoples’ behavior inhibition and activation systems relates to their willingness to fly during the pandemic period, and what kind of promotions could increase their willingness to fly. For this aim, from March 2021 to May 2021, 1231 people were reached over the internet using the convenience-sampling method, and 862 respondents answered the questionnaire. Structural Equation Model was used to test the proposed model and t- test, correlation analysis and descriptives were used in the analysis of the obtained data. Main findings of the research showed that willingness to fly is mostly affected by health measure promotions instead of price promotions. In addition, it was found that willingness to fly during the pandemic period changed based on gender. The results of the structural equational modelling showed that a higher level of BIS is related to higher levels of perceived travel risk, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity; and perceived travel risk was found to mediate the relationship between BIS and willingness to fly during the pandemic. The results were discussed in the light of the current literature and suggestions were made for airline companies to increase the number of passengers in possible pandemics.","The COVID-19 pandemic affects the airline transportation industry in all aspects.

In 2008 it was safer to fly medical evacuation missions in Iraq and Afghanistan than in the Continental United States. This study is designed to test whether the financial performance of the local base and a hyper mission orientation have a negative effect on aeronautical decision making among HEMS crews.  A Likert type survey was administered to HEMS pilots and medical crews to ascertain their thoughts and feelings regarding the two questions under investigation. While the data clearly showed that poor financial performance at the base level and an acute desire to complete the mission do not have a negative effect on aeronautical decision making among HEMS crews, it did reveal a distinct divide among attitudes between pilots and medical crews.",Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) is among the most dangerous type of flying in the United States today.

283,2022,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,Impact of Spatial Orientation Ability on Air Traffic Conflict Detection in a Simulated Free Route Airspace Environment,"In the selection of job candidates who have the mental ability to become professional ATCOs, psychometric testing has been a ubiquitous activity in the ATM domain. To contribute to psychometric research in the ATM domain, we investigated the extent to which spatial orientation ability (SOA), as conceptualized in the spatial cognition and navigation literature, predicted air traffic conflict detection performance in a simulated free route airspace (FRA) environment. The implementation of free route airspace (FRA) over the past few years, notably in Europe, have facilitated air traffic services by giving greater flexibility to aviation operators in planning and choosing preferred air routes that can lead to quicker arrivals. FRA offers enhanced system safety and efficiency, but these benefits can be outweighed by the introduction of air traffic conflicts that are geometrically more complex. Such conflicts can arise from increased number and distribution of conflict points, as well as from elevated uncertainty in aircraft maneuvering (for instance, during heading changes). Overall, these issues will make conflict detection more challenging for air traffic controllers (ATCOs). Consequently, there is a need to select ATCOs with suitably high levels of spatial orientation ability (SOA) to ensure flight safety under FRA implementation. In this study, we tested 20 participants who are eligible for ATCO job application, and found that response time-based performance on a newly developed, open access, computerized spatial orientation test (SOT) predicted time to loss of minimum separation (tLMS) performance on an air traffic conflict detection task (AD-CDT) we designed. We found this predictive relationship to be significant to a moderately large extent under scenarios with high air traffic density (raw regression coefficient = 0.58). Moreover, we demonstrated our AT-CDT as a valid test in terms of eliciting well-known mental workload and spatial learning effects. We explained these findings in light of similar or overlapping mental processes that were most likely activated optimally under task conditions featuring approximately equal numbers of outcome-relevant stimuli. We conclude by discussing the further application of the SOT to the selection of prospective ATCOs who can demonstrate high levels of conflict detection performance in FRA during training simulations.","In the selection of job candidates who have the mental ability to become professional ATCOs, psychometric testing has been a ubiquitous activity in the ATM domain.

The Relationship between Emotional Contagion and Organisational Identification,"This article presents empirical research that aimed to determine the direction and strength of the relationships between emotional contagion and organisational identification. Our study examined the effect of aviation sector employees’ emotional contagion levels on organisational identification and the moderating role of career characteristics, such as age differences and seniority, in this effect. Data collected from 296 aviation employees were analyzed using SPSS 25 and SPSS Process Macro programs for determining moderating effects. The findings revealed that emotional contagion has a positive and significant effect on organisational identification. It has been determined that individuals’ age and seniority differences have a moderating role in the effect of emotional contagion on organisational identification. The fact that the scope of the research is a single sector and organisation hinders the findings’ generalizability. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to explain the cause-and-effect relationships between psychological factors. The results proved that positive emotions affect individuals faster than negative emotions and are more effective on OI. Hence, the establishment of an organisational climate dominated by feelings of love and happiness and devoid of feelings of fear and anger is recommended for managers seeking to foster OI. By revealing the implicit relationships among the concepts with empirical evidence, we aim to fill a significant gap, particularly with respect to organisational psychology, and to represent new insights to scholars and practitioners.","This article presents empirical research that aimed to determine the direction and strength of the relationships between emotional contagion and organisational identification.

286,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The effect of team training strategies on team mental model formation and team performance under routine and non-routine environmental conditions,"The current study examined how the type of training a team receives (team coordination training vs. cross-training) influences the type of team mental model structures that form and how those mental models in turn impact team performance under different environmental condition (routine vs. non-routine). Three-hundred and fifty-two undergraduate students from a large northeastern university participated in the current study (176 dyads). Data were collected through the NeoCITIES simulation, which is a simulated task environment of an emergency management team. Team training was manipulated across subjects while environmental condition was manipulated within subjects. Findings indicated that training type had no main effect on team mental models but did have a significant impact on performance. Specifically, dyads exposed to cross-training had higher levels of performance than those that received team coordination training. In addition, team mental models had a significant main effect on performance, such that the increased accuracy and sharedness of situation mental models, the increased sharedness of teamwork mental models, and the increased accuracy of taskwork mental models resulted in higher levels of performance. Surprisingly, the increased sharedness of taskwork mental models was also found to decrease performance. Finally, contrary to previous findings, the effect of team mental models on team performance was not moderated by environmental condition. The results from ancillary analyses evaluating the relationship between team training and performance and team mental models and performance are discussed, along with the limitations and implications of these findings.","The current study examined how the type of training a team receives (team coordination training vs cross-training) influences the type of team mental model structures that form and how those mental models in turn impact team performance under different environmental condition (routine vs non-routine).

The data was collected from in-depth interviews with 67 airline staff (including 23 women pilots), participant and non-participant observation and written documentation on the aviation industry.The study aimed to critically examine the difficulties faced by women pilots working within commercial aviation.  The intention was not simply to confirm problems encountered by women working within male-dominated environments and present recommendations to management, but to identify the location of future developments in equal opportunities.The findings show that commercial aviation continues to be dominated by masculine values and practices which result in the earlier stages of pilots' careers being treated as a rite of passage.  The stressful and unsupportive atmosphere created problems for male and female pilots, but the difficulties were exacerbated for women by sexism, high visibility and isolation.  In contrast to male pilots, women also had to prove their competence during subsequent checks, courses and flights.The thesis summarises the recommendations made to management, but demonstrates the limited potential for improving the conditions encountered by women pilots through conventional equal opportunities policies and other management initiatives.  It also highlights the problems of relying on professional women who are in a minority to promote equal opportunities.In conclude that future feminist research on gender should focus on women who are in a position to challenge existing discourses and target recommendations at women's groups, unions etc., rather than management.","In response to the limitations of previous approaches to work, gender and change, a poststructural feminist approach was adopted to investigate commercial aviation and the experiences of women pilots working within a large international airline based in Europe.

The present study aimed at evaluating the perception of light stimulus via the Critical Flicker Fusion threshold (CFF) measurements among aviation pilots.The study was carried out under hypoxic conditions corresponding to 5000 m altitude, for a period of 30 min, without the use of supplemental oxygen. Fourteen volunteer pilots, 23-30 years of age, were examined in the hypobaric chamber (HC). The measurements were performed at normobaria and at the initial and final phase of hypoxia. Heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were monitored.The high altitude hypoxia was found to produce a decrease in the CFF threshold F(3.39) = 3.207, p < 0.05, and SaO2 F(3.39) = 52.651, p < 0.001, as well as HR increase F(3.39) = 7.356, p < 0.001. The results indicate that the higher the decrease in SaO2 under hypoxic conditions, the higher the decrease in CFF r = .567 p < 0.05. Likewise, the higher the increase in HR, the higher the decrease in CFF r = -0.491 p < 0.05.Under hypoxic conditions, the perceptual ability of the pilots is gradually decreasing. This has been confirmed by the findings of the physiological examinations. The authors express an opinion that it would be advisable to introduce CFF measurement into the hypobaric chamber tests as it allows individual assessment of the pilot's perceptual ability under conditions of incomplete physiological compensation of the high altitude hypoxia.","Human reactions to environmental changes have been the subject of numerous investigations related to pathophysiology, aviation psychology, aviation, and sports.

293,2015,PLoS One,P300 Event-Related Potential as an Indicator of Inattentional Deafness?,"An analysis of airplane accidents reveals that pilots sometimes purely fail to react to critical auditory alerts. This inability of an auditory stimulus to reach consciousness has been coined under the term of inattentional deafness. Recent data from literature tends to show that tasks involving high cognitive load consume most of the attentional capacities, leaving little or none remaining for processing any unexpected information. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence for a shared attentional capacity between vision and hearing. In this context, the abundant information in modern cockpits is likely to produce inattentional deafness. We investigated this hypothesis by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements with an ecological aviation task performed under contextual variation of the cognitive load (high or low), including an alarm detection task. Two different audio tones were played: standard tones and deviant tones. Participants were instructed to ignore standard tones and to report deviant tones using a response pad. More than 31% of the deviant tones were not detected in the high load condition. Analysis of the EEG measurements showed a drastic diminution of the auditory P300 amplitude concomitant with this behavioral effect, whereas the N100 component was not affected. We suggest that these behavioral and electrophysiological results provide new insights on explaining the trend of pilots’ failure to react to critical auditory information. Relevant applications concern prevention of alarms omission, mental workload measurements and enhanced warning designs.","An analysis of airplane accidents reveals that pilots sometimes purely fail to react to critical auditory alerts. This inability of an auditory stimulus to reach consciousness has been coined under the term of inattentional deafness. Recent data from literature tends to show that tasks involving high cognitive load consume most of the attentional capacities, leaving little or none remaining for processing any unexpected information.","<title>P300 Event-Related Potential as an Indicator of Inattentional Deafness?</title> <excerpt>An analysis of airplane accidents reveals that pilots sometimes purely fail to react to critical auditory alerts.

294,2012,PQDT - Global,Pilots Performance and Flight Safety: Flight Physiology in Unpressurized Aircraft Cabins,"Light aviation pilots are exposed to many different environmental situations due to the nonpressurized and non-acclimatized aircraft cabin. Some of those variations can push the human body to some limits, which associated with psychological factors may culminate in incidentes or even fatalities. Actually, a literature review on this theme suggests that a significant part of the incidents and fatalities, within the light aviation that uses non-pressurized aircraft cabins, are related to the human factor. This analysis might bring up a concealed but significant and worrying phenomenon in terms of flight safety: changes of pilot performance in the amendment of psychological and physiological parameters, concerning to diferente stress levels and to pressure variations during the various flight stages, respectively. This may be a concerning situation due to the disparity of human body reaction between diferente pilots to the same flight conditions. Nature, both in terms of environmental factors, as pressure and temperature, or in human physiological and psychological behaviour, during the different flight phases, is unpredictable. Therefore, it is very difficult to establish safety boundaries.This study general objective is to analyse the influence of flight environmental conditions and pilots psychophysiological parameters on task performance, during different flight situations, considering some of his everyday habits. To this end, a statistical analysis of a survey, regarding specific questions about the need for pilot’s attention monitoring systems, was made, and, in parallel, a portable and ergonomic monitoring system was built. This system equipment records cerebral oximetry, to study the hypoxia phenomenon and its importance, electrocardiography (ECG), and electroencephalography (EEG), in order to establish a correlation between the influence of mental workload and other physiological parameters during different flight stages.The specific purpose of this study is to define physiological limits for each pilot, through simulation tests contemplating different flight scenarios, in order to create an on board alert system to prevent possible incidents.With this research is also intended to suggest that a potential restriction on pilots licensing legislation for light aviation, within physiological limits definitions, would be a positive contribution to a safer flight environment.","Light aviation pilots are exposed to many different environmental situations due to the nonpressurized and non-acclimatized aircraft cabin.

295,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The Lived-Experience of Inflight Automation Failures: A Qualitative Descriptive Phenomenological Study,"Aviation automation assists pilots in both workload and safety operations. The flying public desires a safe flying environment expecting to fly everywhere in all types of weather and flight conditions. The complex nature of the aircraft and their operating environment provide opportunities for automation failures to affect flight operations. Previous research has examined the nature of automation failures to understand the relationships between variables such as the phase of flight, experience, flight conditions, and training. Qualitatively, scientists have investigated the nature of the human-machine interaction to determine how individuals make sense of automation failures, yet none have examined the experience from the pilot’s perspective. Giorgi’s descriptive phenomenological psychological method focuses on the individual subjective descriptions and synthesizes a psychological profile of the automation failure experience. The results describe a pilot's lived-experiential loop, which includes an awareness of themselves, their aircraft, and automation failure. Their present-moment stream of consciousness demonstrates a continual situational awareness augmented by their past training and operational experiences and reinforced by their future objectives. The research gives pilots and researchers a glimpse into the thoughts of aviators that experience automation failures and describe the psychological constituents of those experiences. The structure of the automation failure experience provides an empathetic understanding of the pilot sensemaking processes.",Aviation automation assists pilots in both workload and safety operations.

A survey comprised of the 6-item Professor-Student Rapport Scale- Brief (PSRS-B) (Wilson & Ryan, 2013) and the 35-item learner empowerment measure (Frymier et al., 1996) was disseminated to undergraduate students in Aviation Management and Professional Flight in the School of Aviation. The survey data were analyzed using linear regression and the results indicated there was a statistically significant relationship between instructor-student rapport and undergraduate aviation student feelings of empowerment. Further, a statistically significant relationship was found between instructor-student rapport and student feelings of impact, meaningfulness, and competence. Specifically, the measures of empowerment and meaningfulness were found to be more strongly associated with rapport than impact and competence. If there is a relationship between instructor-student rapport and student feelings of empowerment, it is incumbent on instructors to create classroom environments promoting rapport with students to support their empowerment. In turn, empowered students may be able to take this empowerment into their communities to increase critical consciousness.","This study investigated the relationship between undergraduate aviation student perception of instructor-student rapport and perceived student empowerment, as measured by the constructs of impact, meaningfulness, and competence.

The Department of Psychology adopted robust assessment measures to select pilot candidates with requisite psychological attributes to commence flight-training program in the NAF. The annual medical and psychological fitness examinations were also conducted on both pilots and trainees to determine their fitness to continue with flying duties as well as provide psychological aid to those at risk. Although NAF had a well articulated policy for the training of aircrew, yet the implementation of the program was handicapped by problems of economic, socio-technical and infrastructural services which affected full realization of the aircrew training program.

298,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A novel approach in facilitating aviation emergency procedure learning and recall through an intuitive pictorial system,"The intent of this research was to examine the utility and merit of a novel system of intuitive symbols (a mnemonic strategy) in conjunction with the training of aviation emergency procedures (EPs) to U.S. Army aviation personnel in order to facilitate the accurate recall of those procedures. Aviators must deal with emergency situations by performing the necessary actions in an established sequence. Many are necessarily performed from memory. A previous study on aviator EP proficiency found that without active practice of the conventionally-learned textual procedures, recall ability decays significantly over a relatively short period of time which results in the inability to respond accurately in the event of an actual emergency. Previous research has demonstrated that providing students with instructions on the use of memorization techniques (mnemonic strategies) has resulted in improvements in their ability to recall information. This study employed a pretest-posttest, control group design to test the effectiveness of this novel mnemonic strategy with respect to the aviators' levels of flight experience, their learning style preferences, and their overall subjective assessments of the system. The design was applied to three distinct groups based on experience levels (highly-experienced, minimally-experienced and naïve). Descriptive and inferential statistics, along with correlations, were used to assess the study data which determined statistically significant differences between the IPS and traditional training methods. Although the study's findings did not show the IPS as producing performance gains superior to that of the traditional method, the findings did demonstrate the utility and merit of the system as an augmentation to traditional textual procedures. The manner in which the symbols were able to facilitate the recall of uncommon, unfamiliar terms and phrases in a naïve population to a level comparable to that of highly-experienced pilots in just one week, highlights the potential for such a mnemonic strategy to aid in the encoding of information into long-term memory. This information could lead to important innovations to current U.S. Army teaching techniques. A standardized pictorial system of aviation procedures may not just benefit individual graduate and student pilots, but could be a valuable contribution to military and civil aviation safety.",The intent of this research was to examine the utility and merit of a novel system of intuitive symbols (a mnemonic strategy) in conjunction with the training of aviation emergency procedures (EPs) to U.S. Army aviation personnel in order to facilitate the accurate recall of those procedures.

299,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A comparison of the effectiveness of a personal computer -based aircraft training device and a flight training device at improving pilot instrument proficiency: A case study in leading regulatory change in aviation education,"Aviation educators have long sought economical and effective ways to simulate how an aircraft flies. In particular, there has always been an interest in simulating the procedures and practices of operating an aircraft in instrument flight conditions, when no horizon is visible. Because the costs of flying aircraft continue to increase, there has been an interest in adopting the technology of the microcomputer to bring realistic flight simulation at lower costs to the general aviation market.  The introduction of the personal computer-based aircraft training device, or PCATD, in the late 1990s stimulated the academic investigation of this technology for use in collegiate aviation education activities. Initially Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulators dismissed this technology as gaming software and hardware, but the successful use of PCATD technology for training general aviation pilots as shown by academic studies convinced the FAA in 1997 (AC 61-126) to approve the use of PCATDs as an equivalency to actual flight time, but for only a portion of that equivalency allowed for FAA approved FTDs.  This study, a comparison of the effectiveness of a PCATD with that of an FAA approved FTD for maintaining an instrument pilot's ILS proficiency, is another effort to stimulate FAA acceptance of this new technology as an effective and economical way to provide valid simulated learning activities to the general aviation community.   Specifically, this study found that there was no significant statistical difference between using the PCATD or the FAA approved FTD for maintaining an instrument pilot's ILS proficiency. This study also found that there was no statistical significant difference in either device's effectiveness at maintaining an instrument pilot's proficiency. The process of regulatory change in any bureaucracy is a time-consuming process. As Kocks (2005) wrote, the FAA adapts change on the same pace that mountains form. However, the challenge of new simulation technology, in this study the PCATD, will not abate, and aviation educators and regulators should accept it as an effective means by which the general aviation pilot community can maintain, and improve, the safety of its instrument flight practices.","Aviation educators have long sought economical and effective ways to simulate how an aircraft flies.

300,2025,Iranian Journal of Science and Technology. Transactions of Civil Engineering,Modeling Airline Choice Behavior Based on Observed and Latent Variables Using Structural Equation Modeling and Multinomial Logit-Factor Analysis Hybrid Approach,"In an era of intense competition and declining profits, airlines are increasingly focused on understanding and meeting customer needs to enhance service quality and attract more passengers. Previous studies have often treated airline choice as a function of observed variables alone. This research fills the gap by incorporating latent psychological factors using a hybrid modeling approach, providing a more holistic view of the decision-making process. In this study, an attempt was made to examine the personal and travel characteristics of passengers and their impact on airline choice at Mehrabad International Airport, Iran. To identify the structures of latent variables, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used, and they were then presented to a multinomial logit-factor analysis (MNL-FA) hybrid approach as observed variables for the choice model of airline and ticket price. The results of EFA indicated that the number of samples was sufficient for this analysis and FA was appropriate to identify the structure of the factor model. CFA results showed that compatible people paid more attention to airline tangibles and image in airline choice. Also, more extroverted people paid more attention to airline costs and image. Moreover, people with higher conscientiousness paid less attention to airline tangibles in airline choice and the costs associated with an airline were less influential in the choice by these people. Results also indicated that neurotic people were sensitive to airline tangibles, costs and flight planning when choosing an airline, and people who were more eager for new experiences paid more attention to tangibles, image and cost factors when choosing an airline, and were less sensitive to flight planning. MNL-FA hybrid model results showed that monthly family expenses above 250$, morning flight time, self-employment, travel with friends, number of vehicles in family ownership, housekeeper and three or more vehicles in family ownership were among the effective factors affecting the choice of the ticket price of an airline. Furthermore, the personality characteristics of compatibility and conscientiousness had positive effects on the choice of airline and ticket price, respectively.","In an era of intense competition and declining profits, airlines are increasingly focused on understanding and meeting customer needs to enhance service quality and attract more passengers.

Participants, who consisted of members of the subject university's professional pilot program, were divided into either a control or experimental group and completed a ground training session and scripted simulator flight. The simulator flight contained an engine failure en-route during low instrument flight conditions. The aircraft was equipped with an emergency airframe parachute, and an expert panel determined a parachute deployment to be the best outcome to the scenario. Participants' response time to the emergency was measured, and an ANCOVA analysis found no significant difference to exist between the groups. Interestingly, only nine of the 21 participants responded as expected by the expert panel and deployed the parachute. A follow-up survey was administered to provide qualitative data and offer possible explanation for this discrepancy.","The purpose of this study was to determine if a reflexive learning treatment utilizing select case studies could enhance the decision-making of pilots who encounter an irreversible emergency.

The study used an explanatory correlational design to determine the relationship between the targeted factors and professionalism. Research factors included gender, marital status, age, race/ethnicity, income, education level, years of experience, number of FAA ratings, total flight hours, perceptions of professionalism, and level of professional activity/involvement measured by Kramer’s (1974) Index of Professionalism (IOP). The dependent variable was professionalism, measured by Snizek’s (1972) Hall’s Professionalism Inventory. The sample consisted of 674 participants: AMT = 68, AM = 76, ATC = 44, NPAE = 199,Pilots = 287).With the exception of the ATC subgroup, IOP scores were significantly related to professionalism, particularly with respect to: number of professional courses taken, number of professional journal subscriptions, number of professional books purchased, number of weekly hours engaged in professional reading, and membership in professional organizations. Other significant factors within subgroups included: income (AMT), race/ethnicity and education (NPAE), and flight hours(Pilots). No significant factors were found in the ATC subgroup. For the between groups analysis, the Pilot and ATC subgroups had the highest and lowest levels of professionalism, respectively. Participants in all subgroups also perceived professionalism from a cognitive (attitudinal or a mind-set) perspective rather than from an empirical (practical and measurable) perspective.

305,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,The Blackout in Britain and Germany During the Second World War,"The impact of air raid precautions in Britain and Germany has received little scholarly attention since the end of the Second World War. Of the protective measures brought about as a result of the invention of the bomber, the blackout was by far the most intrusive and extensive form of civil defence. Yet the historiography of the home front and the bombing war in Britain and Germany has tended to sideline the blackout, or else ignore it entirely.The lack of study given to the blackout is at odds with the scale of its impact across wartime society. This thesis furthers understanding of the blackout and the social history of the British and German home fronts by contextualising the blackout within the development of aviation, and its social and economic effects. It also examines the impact technology could have on the relationship between state and citizens, and addresses the lack of comparative research on Britain and Germany during the Second World War.The thesis draws on extensive research conducted in local and national government archives in Britain and Germany, as well as a wide range of secondary literature on the war and inter-war period. It argues that the blackout was a profound expansion of the state into the lives of each nation’s citizens, and though it was set within two politically very different states, it brought with it similar practical and social problems. The blackout, as the most ‘social’ form of civil defence, is an ideal aspect of the war by which to compare the British and German home fronts. Ultimately, the differences between the two countries were less important than the shared sense of obligation that the blackout principle was intended to foster within the wartime community.","The impact of air raid precautions in Britain and Germany has received little scholarly attention since the end of the Second World War.

307,2022,PQDT - Global,"Celebrity, Nation, and Motor Cultures in Britain: Donald Campbell's Speed Records, 1949-1967","This doctoral thesis examines the career of speed record-breaker Donald Campbell to illuminate changing attitudes to celebrity, technology, and nation. Following the tradition established by his record-breaking father Sir Malcolm Campbell, Donald mounted a series of record attempts in a succession of vehicles names Bluebird, setting his first record on Lake Ullswater in 1955, and becoming the only person to hold both the land and water speed records in the same year, 1964. He died on 4 January 1967 attempting to break the 300-mph barrier on Coniston Water. Campbell’s exploits attracted attention not only in Britain but around the world, yet his projects and speed record-breaking have received little scholarly examination.The thesis examines how Campbell funded and promoted his record attempts, his construction as a celebrity and speed record-breaking as a media spectacle, across four chapters, engaging with scholarship on heroic reputations, media and celebrity, sport and motoring, and on national decline. Chapter one charts Campbell’s changing media representation in the media in print and in radio, newsreels, and television. Speed generated a compelling spectacle focused on the ‘Speed King’ Campbell, a British hero. My study of media representations and papers in the BBC Written Archives reveals the vital role Campbell himself played in crafting his image, supporting Sharon Marcus’s recent emphasis on celebrities’ influence over their public profile. The thesis analyses Campbell’s early promotion of an alleged ‘Water Barrier’ at 200-mph, similar to the Sound Barrier, to generate suspense and scientific legitimacy. Campbell projected the image of a modernised gentleman, combining the traditional elements of style and courtesy with the glamourous lifestyle of a playboy, of fast cars, attractive women and exotic foreign travel. The chapter reveals how diminishing success, arguments with sponsors, the absence of fresh spectacle and middle age generated increasingly negative commentary in the 1960s, as Campbell focused more on the vastly more expensive – and difficult – land speed records.Chapters two and three examine the organisation, sponsorship and promotion of Campbell’s records. Chapter two situate Campbell in the burgeoning motor cultures of the period. My research shows how Campbell was treated as an expert on speed in Britain and around the world. Although he only achieved one land speed record, Campbell was always associated with motoring and frequently compared with racing drivers like Stirling Moss. Adverts portrayed a modern gentleman, used to promote a range of motoring products and fashion accessories, who contributed to the rise of what I call ‘conspicuous motoring’. Although he was associated with danger, campaigners used Campbell as an expert on speed to promote road safety. Far from the vanity projects of a wealthy eccentric, chapter three analyses a range of business archives to show how private companies and the state backed Campbell’s projects to promote national prestige, specific products and technological innovation. Drawing on David Edgerton’s model of a ‘Warfare State’, my research shows how the British state provided support through loans and patronage.The final chapter examines responses to Campbell’s death, which was extensively recorded in written reports, photographs, films, and audio. The subsequent media spectacle re-energised interest in Campbell, securing his reputation as a national hero in a tradition of British pioneers, particularly explorers who risked their lives for the honour of the nation and for science. Debate about the causes of the disaster generated more downbeat assessments, emphasising the end of an era and portraying Campbell as an anachronism in the Space Age of the later 1960s, a view secured by an influential ITV documentary The Price of a Record.","This doctoral thesis examines the career of speed record-breaker Donald Campbell to illuminate changing attitudes to celebrity, technology, and nation.

309,2020,PQDT - Global,The Contribution of Quality Management on Employee’s Performance in Public Institutions: A Case of Tanzania Revenue Authority,"Quality management has recently been an important aspect in improving the performance of employees in any organization, be it business or non-business. This study principally assessed the contribution of quality management on the employee’s performance in the public sector. The study had focused on three indicators which are the top management strategies, human resource management practices and process management. The research adopted a cross sectional study design where a specific focus was at Tanzania Revenue Authority, Dar es Salaam where interview and questionnaires were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative data respectively. The study adopted two sampling approaches, where simple random sampling was employed in selecting respondents for filling of questionnaires while purposive sampling technique was used to select respondents for interviews. The quantitative data was analysed through descriptive statistics and the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable was established using multiple regressions analysis technique. The study findings revealed that, all the three independent variables top management strategies, human resource management practices and process management had a significant positive relationship with the dependent variable (employees` performance). Therefore, the three variables of quality management are significant predictors of employees` performance. The study recommends that, when practicing quality management, organizations and business should focus on having strategies which enhances quality of services and businesses, and therefore enhancing the performance of employees. Also, all practices regarding making a conducive environment for employees should be highly focused. Employees should be properly rewarded and given the best working environment to be able to fulfil company`s objectives. Apart from that, organizations should practice process management in their organization for their continued survival.","Quality management has recently been an important aspect in improving the performance of employees in any organization, be it business or non-business.

310,2006,PQDT - Global,International Aviation Terrorism: The Lockerbie Affair Between Law and Politics,"On 21 December 1988 a civil airliner, Pan Am 103, blew apart over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland. This was a major terrorist attack against civil aviation, which shocked billions of people and gained worldwide media attention. This thesis examines the Lockerbie case in its political and legal dimension as a heinous and spectacular example of international aviation terrorism. First, it discusses the very idea of terrorism and the inherent definitional problems. Then, it focuses on the disaster and its aftermath. The thesis approaches the numerous issues this complex case raised as years went by. In particular, it portrays the long-standing diplomatic and political wrangle between the United Kingdom and the United States on one side and Libya on the other side.The International Court of Justice and the United Nations Security Council were both involved in this case. The thesis tries to depict the inextricable link between law and politics within the United Nations framework and the difficult balance the judicial and the political powers need striking for a correct and fruitful functioning of the whole system. The Lockerbie case turned out to be a testing-gown for the inherent consistency of the United Nations set-up. Extradition of the alleged perpetrators of the bombing was the issue at stake. For the first time ever, the Security Council imposed sanctions on a sovereign state in order to secure to justice the alleged perpetrators of a terrorist attack. And this raised another pivotal issue that this thesis explores: the adequacy of sanctions as a means for inducing a country’s leadership to adopt a certain course of action.The Lockerbie case is also a story of unofficial diplomacy where mediation of enlightened leaders such as Nelson Mandela proved pivotal. The stance that so-called emerging powers took was also crucial to determine the course of the following events. Ultimately, a criminal trial took place and somebody was convicted for the heinous onslaught. This thesis tries to analyse the Lockerbie trial in its peculiarity: for the first time ever, a national Court sat in a foreign country in order to deal with a criminal case. If the parties to the dispute had not compromised on the idea of a neutral venue where to stage the trial, the latter would have probably never come about.Yet, the criminal trial was not the closing chapter of the lengthy Lockerbie saga. Of course, for the grieving families of the victims, the fact that somebody was held accountable was better than nothing. Yet, the said families also tried to advocate their own cause and get something more than a criminal verdict convicting one single person. Restitution being impossible, there was still room for monetary compensation. This thesis focuses on the lengthy and painful battle the families of the Lockerbie victims engaged in. It was a double battle, actually: one against the airline that had somehow let one of its aircraft crash and one against the Libyan Government, which might be held responsible for the deeds of its agents. None of the two was an easy battle to win and yet it was pivotal to fight both, if justice was to be achieved.","On 21 December 1988 a civil airliner, Pan Am 103, blew apart over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland.

312,2017,Homeland Security Affairs,Adaptive Standard Operating Procedures for Complex Disasters,"The nature of disasters has evolved, but emergency management has not kept pace with the change. Today’s crisis environment is subject to countless influences—a product of our globalized, complex society—which produce random and volatile events. Despite the unpredictability of modern disasters, the Homeland Security Enterprise still adheres to prediction-dependent standard operating procedures (SOPs) to guide emergency response. As a result, police, firefighters, and other crisis professionals are less able to manage complex crises.BACKGROUNDProfessional crisis responders perform their duties using four essential tools: professional training, job-specific technology, accumulated work experience, and SOPs.[1] The SOP anticipates the operating environment and provides a checklist of recommended actions to accomplish an objective. Sociologists Charles Parker and Eric Stern claim, “SOPs are based on past experience and expectation.”[2] As long as the actual event adheres to the prediction, personnel can rely on the SOP to impart relevant guidance. However, when reality diverges from the anticipated scenario, SOP guidance becomes less useful.Beginning in the late twentieth century, the global community experienced tremendous improvements in telecommunications and information sharing, allowing agents within this worldwide system to interact with and exert unprecedented influence on each other. This significant increase in connectivity and feedback intensified the complexity of many social systems. Sociologists David Snowden and Mary Boone describe complexity as the behavior of large numbers of agents dynamically reacting to and influencing each other within a bounded system.[3] One of the essential characteristics of complexity is that behavioral outcomes often prove non-intuitive and difficult to predict. Modern disasters can also demonstrate complex characteristics, erupting quickly and evolving in unexpected ways.Modern crises often demonstrate the prediction-defiant characteristics of complexity. To examine these unpredictable characteristics and assess the utility of SOP-driven crisis response vis-à-vis adaptive behavior, this thesis explores three modern crises that demonstrated complex characteristics: the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the Tohoku Tsunami/Fukushima Dai’ichi nuclear incident. Each of these events exhibited complex characteristics and affords the opportunity to assess both SOP-driven and adaptive responses.The case studies consistently showed that SOPs provided inadequate guidance in these crises while adaptive approaches would have been more effective in the complex environments in which the crises occurred. When the actual disasters deviated from the prediction, emergency responders found themselves adhering to irrelevant procedures. For instance, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attempted to follow a hijacking SOP, its officers failed to recognize that the event had become a terror attack. Alternatively, the U.S. Coast Guard successfully supported the maritime evacuation of Manhattan during the 9/11 attacks by consciously departing from SOP guidance. While instances of adaptable behavior did not significantly mitigate these crises, they serve to illustrate the advantages of adaptive behavior approaches over rote, SOP-driven responses in the complex environment.THE ADAPTIVE DESIGN PROPOSALSThe fundamental weakness in SOP guidance for complex crises is its static approach to a variable environment. To mitigate this vulnerability, SOP-driven crisis response must pivot to embrace an adaptive posture. Toward that end, the thesis recommends two methods to integrate adaptability into SOP-driven crisis response. These proposals make use of contemporary research into complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory and a practical application of the Socratic method to the emergency response paradigm.Louise Comfort et al. describe the essential nature of CAS as “the spontaneous reallocation of energy and action to achieve a collective goal in a changing environment.”[4] Essentially, CAS describes the adaptive behavior that agents must demonstrate to achieve their objectives within a complex system. The ability to engage in flexible, dynamic responses to unexpected deviations is necessary, particularly when navigating the hazardous environment of a complex disaster. Similarly, Mary Uhl-Bien, Russ Marion, and Bill McKelvey contend that emergency responders must function as a CAS, following a course dictated by a dynamic interaction with the environment rather than by bureaucratic protocols.[5]The Socratic method is a particularly relevant tool for emergency response in a complex crisis as it promotes an active search for knowledge to achieve comprehension. Its emphasis on challenging assumptions and re-evaluating a problem prepares emergency responders to expect an evolving scenario. Therefore, it is an ideal foundation to develop a dynamic process for succeeding in a complex environment.The first proposal is the incorporation of adaptability prompts into pre-existing crisis SOPs. Based on the Socratic method, these prompts urge emergency responders to challenge their assumptions about the crisis event and continually seek a better way to achieve their objectives. These instructional steps help identify unanticipated events or behaviors in the field and adjust the crisis response plans accordingly. The proposal of adaptability prompts is a simple upgrade to pre-existing SOPs that urges awareness of complexity and promotes adaptive behavior.Patrick Lagadec and Benjamin Topper recommend the provision of cognitive assistance during an emergency.[6] Their analysis suggests that leading emergency response actions in the field while constantly evaluating the crisis environment is a task that may exceed the capacity of a single crisis professional. To accommodate this dilemma, the second proposal recommends the creation of a crisis co-pilot, an ad hoc advisor who helps the lead emergency responder identify any divergence from predicted behavior and encourages adaptation in the field. Essentially, the crisis co-pilot assists the lead emergency responder in adhering to the Socratic tenets recommended by the adaptability prompts, reminding him to challenge initial expectations in the crisis scenario and adapt the operational plan to accommodate the unexpected.A COMPUTER SIMULATION TO SUPPORT THE ADAPTIVE DESIGN PROPOSALSA multi-agent computer simulation is a framework for approximating human decisions within a virtual system to identify the best means for a desired outcome. The computer simulation cannot represent every nuance in human behavior or unpredicted influences in a complex system, so experimental conclusions appear as “if/then” statements rather than concrete assertions. While these results are only hypothetical, they can effectively promote or denigrate a policy proposal by quantifying and depicting its potential value. To illustrate the potential benefit of the adaptive design proposals, the thesis presents a computer simulation based on the FAA response on the morning of September 11th.The simulation experiment approximated the hypothetical value of the adaptive design proposals by incrementally increasing the FAA’s ability to detect the first hijacked airliner on 9/11 as a threat. The goal of this experiment—the point at which the adaptive design proposals achieve a meaningful improvement in the scenario outcome—was to prompt the order to launch alert fighters in time to intercept the second hijacked airliner before it struck the World Trade Center. The outcome of the experiment suggests that if the adaptive design proposals yielded a 25 percent improvement in FAA threat detection, the fighters could have intercepted the second airliner. These results, therefore, may be more broadly construed to indicate that the adaptive design proposals could yield a significant benefit to the field of crisis response.CONCLUSIONWhile ineffective SOPs do not presuppose the failure of emergency responders in every complex event—the quality of their experience and technology arguably overshadows the shortfalls of these static guidelines—they remain a flawed yet fixable problem within the emergency response field. As such, this thesis proposed two executable methods to integrate adaptability into SOP-driven emergency response. By incorporating adaptability prompts into crisis SOPs and instituting the role of a crisis co-pilot, response agencies can more effectively manage complex emergencies. Further, by implementing these steps to integrate adaptability into standardized emergency response, crisis professionals can better manage complex disasters and, in doing so, better protect their communities.[1] The author bases this statement on 18 years of experience in federal law enforcement as both a criminal investigator and an emergency medical technician.[2] Charles F.

Projectou-se então os controladores referidos anteriormente comparando os seus resultados através da dinâmica e navegação do modelo já linearizado, para se verificar qual dos dois será mais apropriado para que a plataforma, no momento em que existe uma alteração na dinâmica da aeronave, possa regressar a essa mesma posição o mais brevemente possivel. Através então dos resultados obtidos, verifica-se em ambos os casos, o sucesso em estabilizar a aeronave e controlar o voo dada uma determinada referência para diferentes velocidades, mas um controlador evidencia-se mais que o outro.","O controlo de helicópteros tem vindo a adquirir nas últimas décadas maior visibilidade devido à característica desta aeronave.

In this thesis, the effects of expertise, working memory capacity, inhibition and divided attention on situation awareness (SA) in simulated flight task environments are investigated. The cognitive aspects underlying the process of situation awareness are explored by analyzing the compound effects of above listed factors. Online and Offline SA measurements obtained from a simulated flight task are used with flight hours standing for expertise and scores of Automated Operation Span Task, Stroop and Coşkunöz visual attention tasks as measurements for working memory capacity, inhibition and divided attention respectively. Regression analyses reveal that expected relationships of simulator pilots’ SA with expertise and inhibition capacity are supported. On the other hand, expected relationships of SA with working memory and divided attention capacities are not revealed. This situation probably results from unsystematic differences in simulator pilots’ practices.In addition to the main experiment, simulator pilots’ levels of neural activity at their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are also measured during their behavioral performance. The relationships among neural correlates of mental workload induced by the simulated flight are investigated by the functional near-infrared (fNIR) spectroscopy optical brain imaging technology. Theorized mental workload distinction in the scenario of the simulated flight task is successfully observed in both perceived workload declarations and oxygenation measurements by fNIR.","Experienced and novice simulator pilots are subject to some of the constraints of a real flight (or a full flight simulator) situation in a PC based flight simulation.

The predictors that were included in the research are: biographical data, ABET levels in terms of English and Matric results, as well as results from psychological tests, namely: English literacy skills assessment (ELSA), Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RMP), Blox test, subtests of the Intermediate Battery (B/77) viz: Arithmetic 1 and 2, and Reading Comprehension, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The objective of the research was to determine the predictive validity of the selection battery utilizing the final flying school results as the criteria.The results of the research were inconclusive. Only some of the tests showed positive correlations with the modules of the flying school results. The Ravens Progressive Matrices, Blox, Matriculation English symbol, ABET levels and Reading Comprehension, were found to have predictive power with some of the modules of the flying school results based on the regression analysis.It is recommended that a revised profile for a commercial airline pilot should be developed, as well as that the critical skills and competencies should be identified to enable the airlines to utilize appropriate and relevant assessment tools to select prospective candidates, particularly among the previously disadvantaged communities.",Commercial airlines need to employ well qualified pilots to run their core business.

317,2012,PQDT - Global,Exploring Stressors in air Traffic Controllers in South Africa,"The aim of this study was to explore the stressors in Air Traffic Controllers in South Africa by means of identifying the possible causes of stress as well as to determine the demographic differences such as age, sex and size of Air Traffic Control Centres in these stressors. Air traffic control is commonly considered a stressful job, and the researcher decided to examine the situation in South Africa.The air traffic control job was also studied to identify the causes of stress as Air Traffic Controllers are very important in their own right and the aviation world are becoming increasingingly complex in which air traffic control plays an essential part. Air Traffic Controllers perform extremely demanding and challenging work, as indicated by the fact that many controllers retire before their acctual retirement with stress-related work disabilities.Stressors, applicable to air traffic controllers, were discussed to help the controller to identify his or her source of stress. It is important because stress is an everyday fact of life, which cannot be avoided but must be adjusted to. Stress is often regarded as an individual problem, however, there are characteristics of work, called “job stressors” that can cause a stress reaction in most workers.The data was collected by means of the Experience of Work and Life Circumstances Questionnaire (WLQ), that was sent to all Air Traffic Control Stations across South Africa. The questionnaire was developed to determine the levels and causes of stress of employees. The WLQ endeavours to establish whether employees experience normal, high or very high levels of stress, and also identify those factors, which cause these levels of stress. The questionnaire consists of three different parts, namely, a demographic questionnaire, experience of work which determine the levels of stress and finally, circumstances and expectations which analyse the causes of stress.It was clear from this study that for Air Traffic Controllers, uncertainty and lack of control over their own destiny and immediate circumstances, contributed to an increase in the levels of stress. It was clear that Air Traffic Controllers value their skills and want to be rewarded accordingly. Therefore, it was further demonstrated that remuneration, employee benefits and employee policies contribute substantially to the levels of stress experienced by Air Traffic Controllers.","The aim of this study was to explore the stressors in Air Traffic Controllers in South Africa by means of identifying the possible causes of stress as well as to determine the demographic differences such as age, sex and size of Air Traffic Control Centres in these stressors.

This thesis focuses on providing 2D and 3D simulation frameworks using a game theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts in scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. The fundamental gap in the literature is that the models of interaction between manned and unmanned vehicles are insu cient: a) they assume that pilot behavior is known a priori and b) they disregard decision making processes. The contribution of this work is to propose a modeling framework, in which, human pilot reactions are modeled using reinforcement learning and a game theoretical concept called level-k reasoning to ll this gap. The level-k reasoning concept is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. Reinforcement learning is a mathematical learning method that is rooted in human learning. In this work, a classical and an approximate reinforcement learning (Neural Fitted Q Iteration) methods are used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 2D and 3D maneuvers.

319,2020,PQDT - Global,Demystifying the Black Box-Exploring How Users Make Sense of Fully Automated Vehicles,"Vehicles are becoming increasingly automated. Already today vehicles are able to take over and assist the human driver in certain driving tasks, and the scope of technical possibilities is rapidly expanding. However, for the proliferation of AVs to occur, there are several challenges that must first be overcome. These challenges are not only structural, including regulations and technological development, but also user-related, such as the adoption of and willingness of users to use the system. Previous research has identified the importance of user understanding of Automated Vehicles (AVs), as this affects usage directly as well as indirectly by impacting acceptance. In this thesis, a design approach has been chosen that uses a product semantic framework as the basis for addressing the issue of user understanding with the aim of exploring how users make sense of the AV. The research presented is based on data from a quasi-experimental study, conducted using a seemingly fully automated (WOz) vehicle on a test course where participants’ understanding was investigated both during and after the test runs.The findings show that use of the AV gave rise to several levels of meaning, based on two different processes. The main one was an external process, where integration of the participants’ conceptual models of human drivers and AVs, artefactual signifiers, and situational signifiers in a context developed meaning. However, an internal process was also evident, where meanings themselves developed new meanings. This thesis presents a tentative model based on the findings, describing three important components: the user’s conceptual model, the signifiers, and the meanings that arise during usage of the AV. The model illustrates the complex interplay between these three components and can be used to better understand and investigate how users make sense of AVs to aid the design and development of AVs.The thesis also contributes to the field of product semantics through the practical application of product semantic theories, in addition to providing further insight into how users develop meaning and make sense of artefacts, by describing the processes and components which seem to be the foundation when making sense of artefacts.Having said that, further studies need to explore in greater detail the dynamics of the process of making sense, the process of making sense in partially automated vehicles, and how meaning changes during a prolonged usage.","Vehicles are becoming increasingly automated.

320,2025,Motivation and Emotion,Associations between maternal envy and parenting practices,"Children’s achievements factor significantly into Chinese mothers’ sense of self-worth and related parenting practices. Mothers often evaluate themselves and their children through social comparison, which might lead to malicious envy or benign envy toward another advantaged parent. This research examined how malicious envy and benign envy were differently associated with autonomy support, helicopter parenting, and psychological control, and whether parental mastery or performance achievement goals mediated these associations. Study 1 included 250 Mainland Chinese mothers (Mage = 44.22, SD = 2.40), who reported dispositional malicious and benign envy, achievement goals, and parenting practices. Study 2 manipulated mothers’ (N = 205, Mage = 42.48, SD = 3.83) recall of malicious or benign envy experiences, and investigated the immediate effects on their attitudes toward parenting practices. Study 1 found that malicious envy positively predicted helicopter parenting and psychological control, through performance-avoidance goals. Benign envy positively predicted helicopter parenting through performance-approach goals, and also positively predicted autonomy support through mastery goals. Results of Study 2 showed that malicious envy prompted stronger endorsement of psychological control than benign envy. Findings call attention to the risks that maternal envy, especially malicious envy, might hold for engagement in childrearing motivations and behaviors characterized by heightened control.","Children’s achievements factor significantly into Chinese mothers’ sense of self-worth and related parenting practices.

321,2020,PQDT - Global,General Variable Neighborhood Search for the Drone-Assisted Vehicle Routing Problem with Robot Stations,"The goal of the present study is to formally define the 'Drone-Assisted Vehicle Routing Prob- lem with Robot Stations' (VRPD-RS), a problem that combines the delivery concept of trucks operating in tandem with drones and satellite stations that store robots to minimize the delivery completion time, i.e., makespan, or the operational cost. Due to the computational complexity of the problem and also to allow addressing instances of practical size and relevance, an heuristic solution approach tailored to the VRPD-RS is presented.The VRPD-RS was modelled as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and numerical exper- iments were performed using a state-of-the-art solver to understand the impact of adding trucks, drones and robot stations to a delivery system. Additionally, an algorithm based on the General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) metaheuristic framework, that applies five local search operators created specifically for the problem, was developed. In order to validate the solution approach, the solutions returned by the algorithm were compared against the results achieved by the solver. Finally, the algorithm was used to solve problems marked by road network congestion to assess how drones and robots can help mitigate its impact on the makespan.The numerical results evidence that the VRPD-RS is computationally demanding as for the minimization of makespan and operational cost, the solver failed to reach optimal solutions within one hour of execution for instances with 10 and 15 customers, respectively. The results also confirm that including robot stations leads to makespan and operational cost reductions. For the makespan objective, the results show that additional trucks are more effective in reducing the delivery time than additional drones, but contribute to increased operational costs. More drones, however, beyond improving makespan, result in cost reductions. Additionally, using multiple trucks and drones did not impact the operational cost obtained using one truck and one drone, but allowed to reduce the corresponding makespan. The proposed GVNS heuristic yielded an average gap of -2.8% to solver solutions within an average of 9 minutes for the makespan objective. In terms of cost minimization, an average gap of 2.5% was achieved for approximately 5 minutes of running time, on average. The analysis of congested scenarios confirmed that, compared to truck- only systems, not only do drones and robots help improve the makespan and associated operational cost but also increase system robustness against makespan increases caused by congestion.This dissertation contributes to the scientific literature concerned with studying the impact of including autonomous vehicles in distribution systems. The computational experiments prove that a delivery concept supported by trucks, drones and robots has a positive impact in terms of minimal delivery time and operational cost. Moreover, an efficient solution approach capa- ble of improving minimum makespan VRPD-RS solutions found by a state-of-the-art solver and reaching near-optimal minimum operational cost VRPD-RS solutions is presented. The GVNS metaheuristic has the potential to be applied in subsequent studies to further demonstrate the use- fulness of the concept modelled by the VRPD-RS, e.g., inclusion of time-windows or optimization of a combined cost-makespan objective.","The goal of the present study is to formally define the 'Drone-Assisted Vehicle Routing Prob- lem with Robot Stations' (VRPD-RS), a problem that combines the delivery concept of trucks operating in tandem with drones and satellite stations that store robots to minimize the delivery completion time, ie, makespan, or the operational cost.

The general aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between SA and individual cognitive di erences. Specifically, the predictive value of working memory and attentional capacity measures on SA measures, taken from pilots of different expertise levels, is of interest. In the literature, SA has mostly been studied from an applied perspective. The present study therefore aims at providing the necessary cognitive underpinnings of these more applied studies.Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, individual di erences and SA measures have been taken from thirty-six pilots. Automated Operation Span, Stroop Task, and Choice Reaction Time Task with Dichotic Listening were used for measuring working memory capacity (WMC), inhibition, and divided attention, respectively. Online and offline SA measurements were employed together for tapping on different aspects of SA in a cognitively demanding flight scenario. Results showed that WMC and expertise explain 58% of variability in offline scores while inhibition, divided attention, and expertise explain 52% of variability in online scores. In Experiment 2, the aim was to find correlates of eye movements in terms of individual differences. Scan patterns were studied across four SA-related visual tasks with ten expert pilots. Results showed that more expert pilots produced less fixation durations but no other e ects of individual di erences on the eye movements were observed. It was also observed that expert pilots deploy some scan strategies while performing these tasks.","Situation Awareness (SA), is defined as perception of environmental entities, comprehension of their meaning, and estimation of their status in the near future (Endsley, 1995a).

Scan paths and three eye-tracking metrics (Fixation Frequency, Gaze Duration Mean, and Gaze Percentage) were used to investigate the differences in eye behavior of three expert control room operators and six novice students as they monitored and corrected a Crude Refinement simulation.A 2x2x2 mixed factor design was used to explore the effects that expertise (expert and novice), interface type (black and grey), and alarm activity (active and inactive) had on participant eye behavior specifically, fixation frequency, gaze duration mean, and gaze percentage for certain areas of interest. The display was separated into 6 different areas and each area resulted in distinct eye statistics. Scan paths were plotted surrounding a subtle setpoint change within the simulation and were qualitatively analyzed to reveal differences due to expertise, interface type and alarm activity.The MANOVA revealed no significant differences due to expertise, interface type, and alarm activity. The single ANOVAs revealed that participants had higher fixation frequencies on the Main display during monitoring periods than during active periods revealing that both expert and novice participants’ attention was more divided when there were failures and alarms present than when the process was running at normal conditions. Also, experts spent a larger percentage of time monitoring the critical crude temperature and flow controller than novices. Pearson’s correlation between dependent variables revealed a positive correlation between fixation frequency and gaze percentage that indicated that participants typically had many, quick fixations rather than few, long fixations. Scan path analysis revealed that active monitoring and interface background color influenced how quickly operators discovered the setpoint change on screen. Overall, eye-tracking successfully detected differences between participants and interface types that can benefit novice training and display design.","There is lacking research within the Petrochemical Industry that uses eye-tracking to explore the differences between the strategies of expert and novice control room operators as they monitor and address process parameters that could be used to improve novice training programs and interface design.

325,2022,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Measuring Cognitive Workload in Automated Knowledge Work Environments,"Automation, as defined by Parasuraman et al. (2000, p. 287), is a “device or system that either partially or fully, accomplishes a function that was previously, partially, or fully accomplished by a human operator.” Traditionally, automation was introduced to (physical) work environments to alleviate workload associated with tedious and repetitive tasks. Over the past few decades, automation has begun to augment knowledge work, which includes high-level cognitive activities. As automated systems expand to perform skill-based tasks, the work required of humans is inevitably altered, potentially affecting their cognitive workloads. Years of research has shown that automation can reduce cognitive workload, but other work suggests that cognitive workload may increase or remain unchanged when automation is introduced. These conflicting results prompt the need for further investigation to better delineate the relationship between automation and cognitive workload.A plethora of factors may explain why the relationship between automation and cognitive workload is inconsistent. Therefore, this research takes steps toward addressing knowledge gaps within the human-automation interaction literature related to understanding how automation used in knowledge work environments affects peoples’ task completion. Specifically, this work investigates how two moderators, task complexity and age, influence the automation and cognitive workload relationship. These moderators were of interest for two reasons. First, task complexity, which occurs when the structure of a task imposes demands on a person’s cognitive processes, increases the demands of a task, which can result in the use of more cognitive resources. Second, age is of interest because advanced technologies are increasingly being utilized by a wide user demographic, particularly the rapidly-growing older adult population.The goals of this dissertation were achieved by employing both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine how (1) automation is assessed in knowledge work environments, (2) automation affects cognitive workload, and (3) task complexity and age moderate the relationship between automation and cognitive workload. These goals were first addressed via the construction of a conceptual framework that describes the effects that task complexity and age have on the relationship between automation and cognitive workload. Next, a systematic review of the humanautomation interaction literature in knowledge work environments was performed to examine researchers’ use of cognitive workload measures. Finally, a controlled-laboratory experiment and a scenario-based survey were conducted to collect data from people of different ages about how task complexity and age influence the relationship between automation and cognitive workload.Findings from the systematic literature review showed that researchers primarily employ subjective and performance measures to assess cognitive workload. Results from the laboratory experiment suggested that automation improved measures of cognitive workload. Also, task complexity negatively affected the relationship between automation and cognitive workload, but age was not found to be a moderator. The scenario-based survey revealed that task performance was similar among younger, middle-aged, and older adults. However, younger adults had a more favorable opinion of automation compared to both middle-aged and older age groups.Overall, this research (1) enhances our knowledge of the relationship between automation and cognitive workload, (2) informs the design of future human-automation studies with strategically selected task types and measurement choices, based on patterns that emerged from the literature review, and (3) can ultimately guide designers in better developing technologies to support people in performing various activities in their work and leisure environments.","Automation, as defined by Parasuraman et al (2000, p. 287), is a “device or system that either partially or fully, accomplishes a function that was previously, partially, or fully accomplished by a human operator.” Traditionally, automation was introduced to (physical) work environments to alleviate workload associated with tedious and repetitive tasks.

However, faces also enjoy an advantage at the early stage of basic-level detection, as demonstrated by efficient visual search for faces among nonface objects. In the present study, we asked (1) whether the face advantage in detection is a unique signature of face expertise, or whether it generalizes to other objects of expertise, and (2) whether expertise in face detection is intrinsically linked to expertise in face individuation. We compared how groups with varying degrees of object and face expertise (typical adults, developmental prosopagnosics [DP], and car experts) search for objects within and outside their domains of expertise (faces, cars, airplanes, and butterflies) among a variable set of object distractors. Across all three groups, search efficiency (indexed by reaction time slopes) was higher for faces and airplanes than for cars and butterflies. Notably, the search slope for car targets was considerably shallower in the car experts than in nonexperts. Although the mean face slope was slightly steeper among the DPs than in the other two groups, most of the DPs' search slopes were well within the normative range. This pattern of results suggests that expertise in object detection is indeed associated with expertise at the subordinate level, that it is not specific to faces, and that the two types of expertise are distinct facilities. We discuss the potential role of experience in bridging between low-level discriminative features and high-level naturalistic categories.

Each  evaluation was started at 0800 h with participants reporting to sleep lab at IAM.  Subjective feeling of sleepiness and fatigue, sleep quality in the previous night were  assessed through questionnaires. Objective assessment of alertness and performance  was assessed through Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) monitor. At 1200 h drug  intervention Placebo/Zolpidem 5 mg/ Zolpidem 10 mg was carried out after  subjective and objective assessment. There after participants were made to sleep in  sleep lab. From 1800 to 2400 h the subjective and objective assessments were  conducted every hourly.Results: The participants in the study perceived no difference in the sleep  quality induced by Zolpidem in daytime with previous night sleep quality (GSQS: Placebo: 0800h – 1.35 ± 1.03 & 1800h – 2.95 ± 2.41 p=0.013; 5 mg Zolpidem:  0800h – 1.50 ± 1.27 & 1800h – 1.75 ± 1.33 p=0.564; 10 mg Zolpidem: 0800 h – 1.60  ± 1.35 & 1800 h: 1.75 ± 1.65 p=0.366). The Zolpidem induced sleep in all  participants at the time participants were feeling very active (KSS). The SSS  exhibited significant increase with increase in time from wakefulness with placebo  and Zolpidem 5mg and 10 mg group. However with 5mg Zolpidem the alertness was  maintained after waking from sleep whereas with 10mg Zolpidem subjects perceived  sleepiness at 1800h and thereafter their alertness was maintained. Lapses in PVT  exhibited significant increase in number of lapses with increase in time of  wakefulness in placebo group (p=0.033). However, there was no significant effect  with increase in time of wakefulness with Zolpidem 5 mg (p=0.882) and Zolpidem 10  mg (p=0.089). The other parameters of PVT (Mean RT, Mean RRT, Mean 10% FRT,  Mean 10% SRT) exhibited no significant effect between time of wakefulness and  drug intervention.Conclusion:In this study the Zolpidem initiated the sleep at time not favourable  to sleep effectively with no decrement in mental alertness and performance  subsequent to arousal after Zolpidem induced daytime sleep. 5 mg Zolpidem found to  effective in maintaining alertness in post awake period compared to 10 mg Zolpidem. It is thus concluded from the study that Zolpidem is effective as ‘No-Go Pill’ and can  be utilised in aviation scenario to optimise the aircrew performance in situations  involving circadian disruptions and sustained/continuous operations.","Introduction:The detrimental effects of fatigue are well known to affect  adversely the both physical and physiological well being.

331,2021,PQDT - Global,Developing a Measurement Scale for Evaluating Perceived Affective Qualities in Flight Deck Design,"While traditional human factors approaches have focused on efficiency, usability, and safety, emerging approaches have also focused on product experience. There is a shift from a cognitive perspective to an affective one, which concerns promoting pleasure instead of just preventing design deficiencies. There has been a growing interest in affect and pleasure in such areas as engineering design, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, and industrial design. Human Factors/Ergonomics (HF/E) approaches in aviation generally focus on the system’s functional features like human performance, human error, workload, and situation awareness, without considering the emotional interactions.This thesis aims to contribute to the aviation area in terms of affective design by determining the affective dimensions of a flight deck design, proposing an evaluation scale for measuring the perceived affective qualities in a flight deck design. For this purpose, two different studies were conducted within the scope of this thesis. In the first study, interviews were conducted with the pilots by using the Repertory Grid Technique and Laddering Technique conjointly to elucidate how pilots evaluate a cockpit design. The findings led to developing a model for affective qualities in flight deck design.The second study aimed to design and verify a scale that measures the affective qualities in flight deck design. For this purpose, based on the previously designed model in the first study and with the items generated there, FlightDeck Affectiveness Rating Scale (F-ARS) was developed and conducted with the pilots. The scale consists of nine dimensions, namely, Pleasure, Comfort, Feeling in Control, Embodiment, Feeling of Being Supported, Sense of Familiarity, Feeling of Being in an Airvehicle, Appreciation of Design/er, and Feeling Safe.","While traditional human factors approaches have focused on efficiency, usability, and safety, emerging approaches have also focused on product experience.

Thus, this study aims to explore the impact of service quality and satisfaction in behavioural intentions, considering passengers of a charter company. A survey was conducted during the period between 24 July and August 20, 2010. Consequently, we have collected 1283 questionnaires of long haul passengers and 4507 questionnaires of medium haul passengers.According to literature review, service quality positively affects passenger behavioural intentions but satisfaction has the strongest effect in.Surprisingly, the dimension of service quality that mostly influences satisfaction and behavioural intentions is the tangible dimension. Also, we didn't find any meaningful relationship between the entertainment on-board in medium-haul and behavioural intentions of passengers. These results will provide knowledge directly obtained from the voice of passengers that can be used by researchers to include charter airlines specificities in the broad investigation about service quality, satisfaction and customer behaviour. In addition, managers can learn from these examples, understanding the dimensions of the service mostly valued as a high potential element to differentiate the firm from the competitors and as adjuvant factors to increase passengers favourable intentions to the company.","From the theoretical and empirical points of view, quality of service and satisfaction have been identified as strong predictors of consumer behavioural intentions.These dynamics have already been studied on the airline context, mainly in regular airlines and low-costs but investigations in the context of charter companies were not found.

334,2015,PQDT - Global,Development of an Integrated Train Driver Performance Model,"The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated performance model of train drivers. A human performance measure was developed, integrating several significant factors of the train driver, and a theoretical framework specified for train driver was established from an extensive review of the literatures. This framework formed the foundation of the study in order to understand the significant factors influencing the performance of a train driver. Three main domains of human, activity and context were proposed to represent the key indicators of the train driver's performance.The evaluation was conducted on train drivers of a major train operating company (TOC) in Malaysia, focusing only on drivers of intercity passenger trains and freight trains. 229 respondents had participated in the quantitative paper-and-pencil survey conducted, and the data obtained was subsequently analysed using SPSS software. An integrated framework was then tested using structural equation modelling (SEM)-PLS approach in theSmartPLS software to determine the relationship among the significant factors of train driver performance. Fourteen factors were hypothesized and tested under the three main domains, namely fatigue, job related tension (internal and external conflict), job satisfactions, occupational stress and sleepiness, which were grouped under human domain; while driving task and job demand represented the activity domain; and lastly, the context domain consisted of the working condition, safety culture, safety issue, working environment and work facilities.The results indicated that fatigue, job related tension (internal conflict) and occupational stress; under human domain were found to be the significant factors which influence the performance of train drivers. For the activity domain, hypothesis testing proved that driving task, was significant factor. In the context domain; three factors were found to be significant. These include safety culture, working environment and working condition. To summarize, the study identified a total of seven significant factorswhich include occupational stress, job related tension – internal conflict, fatigue, driving task, work environment, safety culture and working condition. However, the results have failed to support the remaining seven factors of job related tension (external conflict), job satisfactions, sleep, job demand, work facilities, and safety issue.Significant to this research was that an integrated Malaysian train driver performance model has been successfully developed for identifying the significant factors that influence train driver performance, highlighting the interaction between human factors, human activities and its context. Through this approach, this study has looked at the significant factors in holistic and comprehensive perspective without ignoring other potential domains of factors. Therefore, this model would benefit the rail industry by assisting them in identifying the factor(s) That require close observation and improvement. Thus, the overall performance of the industry would be upgraded and contributes to the betterment of the system and the rail industry.","The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated performance model of train drivers.

336,1999,Psychiatry,Describing traumatic responses and distress of community residents directly and indirectly exposed to an aircraft crash,"This study described the traumatic responses and the extent of psychological distress among residents who had been exposed directly or indirectly to an aircraft crash in Coventry, U.K. The direct exposure group consisted of 62 residents who were on the housing estate at the time of the accident and 20 who were not. They were interviewed on their subjective responses to the crash and then asked to fill in two distress measures: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The results showed a contrast between the responses of the two groups at the time of the crash. They also showed that the direct exposure group had a significantly higher score in the IES item of avoidance, the IES total, the GHQ items of somatization, social dysfunction, and the total score than the indirect exposure group had. Associations were then made between subjective responses and distress measures. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that for the direct exposure residents, the IES total was predicted by ""whether they received professional help"" and ""whether they were worried about their safety after the crash."" The GHQ total of the direct exposure residents was predicted by ""anger about what had happened to them."" For the indirect exposure residents, the IES total was predicted by ""their present feelings when they heard planes flying over."" There were no predictions found between responses and the GHQ total.","This study described the traumatic responses and the extent of psychological distress among residents who had been exposed directly or indirectly to an aircraft crash in Coventry, U.K. The direct exposure group consisted of 62 residents who were on the housing estate at the time of the accident and 20 who were not.

338,2000,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A study of CEO perceptions of the competencies of workplace learning and performance professionals,"The study examined CEO perceptions of competencies for workplace learning and performance professionals. The purpose of the study was to identify the most important abilities of the person responsible for an organization's workplace learning and performance programs. Participants in the study were CEOs in organizations with one thousand or more employees. Participants were identified through an affiliation with Penn State by searching the 1998 Dunn & Bradstreet directory of senior management. Eighty-three CEOs who worked in organizations located throughout the United States were contacted to participate in the study. Twenty-eight, 34%, CEOs from the eighty-three organizations contacted were interviewed. Data was collected through a four-question structured open-ended telephone interview. Data was tape recorded and transcribed for analysis through qualitative software.The researcher constructed themes identified in the study after a comprehensive literature review on competency modeling within the field of human resources. Thematic analysis and frequency counts were used to organize the study findings. Themes identified in each question were grouped into clusters from which the study proposed final assertions. From data collected in responses to the four interview questions asked to each CEO the study's assertions were as follows: (1) Business challenges CEOs were most concerned with were equally balanced between people focused challenges and financial performance challenges. (2) CEOs were closely connected and concerned with their company's workplace learning programs. CEOs perceive workplace learning programs to address business challenges through increasing employee awareness of the company's current business challenges and by designing program content that is directly related to company specific conditions and issues. (3) CEOs generally perceive an active workplace learning environment to be an asset in recruiting and retaining employees. (4) CEOs perceive the most important abilities of people responsible for workplace learning and performance programs to be Process Oriented and Application Oriented competencies. Core competencies within these competency clusters were the abilities to demonstrate business knowledge and to effectively communicate throughout the organization.Further study is needed on cross-industry comparisons of CEO perspectives on WLP. Within the study's reporting-analysis process the researcher examined perceptions of CEOs in manufacturing industries to CEOs perceptions in service industries and did not recognize any difference in perceptions on WLP. Due to time and resource restrictions, the examination could not be developed but could be pursued in another project. Another area for further study of CEO perceptions of WLP is based upon CEO demographics and tenure in their position. Lastly, the researcher suggests further research of CEO rankings of the top five competencies of WLP practitioners.",The study examined CEO perceptions of competencies for workplace learning and performance professionals.

According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), helicopter parenting can threaten youth’s psychological need satisfaction and undermine well-being. This study represents the first investigation of these theorized within-family, time-lagged processes. The research followed 350 late adolescents in Hong Kong (Mage = 18.2, SDage = 1.09, 39.7% male, 60.3% female, 98.9% Chinese) for an academic year, collecting 16 bi-weekly reports of maternal helicopter parenting, youth affective well-being, and youth psychological need satisfaction. Preregistered Dynamic Structural Equation Models showed that, within families, helicopter parenting predicted decreased autonomy and relatedness (but not competence) satisfaction, which subsequently predicted decreased positive affect and increased negative affect. Parenting effects were time-dependent, exhibiting differences in valence and statistical significance between concurrent and time-lagged associations. This meso-longitudinal study highlights the applicability of SDT to parenting contexts and underscores the significance of considering the timeframe in understanding parenting processes.","Parenting processes occur within families and unfold over time.

Data were collected from Korean pilots through in-person survey, utilizing the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). The study focused on preconditions for unsafe acts and unsafe supervision, as well as detecting fatigue using a modified checklist. A three-factor structure comprising 17 subfactors was identified, exhibiting robust psychometric properties, good model fit and reliability. Strong positive relationships were observed between pilot fatigue and all subfactors. The study highlighted the influence of age, job identity, and total flight hours on pilot fatigue. Instructors and more experienced pilots had higher fatigue scores than younger pilots. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to reduce fatigue among middle-aged pilots, instructors, and experienced pilots. The results validate the model’s applicability in Korea and suggest its potential utility in other industrialized nations.","This study investigated the main causes of Air Force pilot fatigue, which could lead to aviation accidents.

342,2025,Microgravity Science and Technology,Impact of + Gz Acceleration Stress on Accuracy of Colour-coded Number Recognition in Pilots,"Colour vision, particularly in modern so-called glass cockpits, plays a crucial role in ensuring flight safety. In this study, we investigated how exposure to high G-forces affects visual perception and performance in colour-coded number recognition tasks among pilots. Ten men fast-jet pilots (ages 28–45 years) were tested in a human centrifuge while reading digitalised plates from an Ishihara test displayed on a screen. Generated accelerations ranged from + 3 to + 7 Gz, increasing in nine intervals of 0.5 G with a rapid onset rate of 1 G·s−1. During each 15-s acceleration plateau, three colour plates were displayed. Colour vision in the blue-yellow and red-green axes was tested in two separate sessions. The accuracy of predicting the correct reading of the colour plates based on the + Gz level was 81% for the blue-yellow axis and 76% for the red-green axis. The first impairment in colour perception occurred at + 5.5 Gz and affected both colour axes. The reading time is slightly affected by increasing G levels, with no apparent relationship to colour processing. Sequential changes in colour perception were observed. A high sensitivity threshold of the Ishihara test likely hindered the detection of subtle changes in colour vision among pilots under high G-forces. Despite its limitations, our study provides useful insights for future research on colour vision under high-G conditions.","Colour vision, particularly in modern so-called glass cockpits, plays a crucial role in ensuring flight safety.

343,2025,Review of Behavioral Finance,Unraveling stock market crashes: insights from behavioral psychology,"PurposeA novel psychology-based framework is proposed to investigate the causes of stock market crashes.Design/methodology/approachOur approach builds upon the dynamic capital mobility model, expanding it by incorporating bidirectional relationships between investor sentiment and the average stock market price level. Investor sentiment is measured in terms of jumping rates of investors’ attitudes to the stock market in our model. The role and impact of investor sentiment on the average stock market price level are further clarified across various scenarios through simulations.FindingsOur model provides a direct quantification of the influence of investor sentiment on stock market price dynamics, shedding light on an alternative mechanism contributing to stock market crashes alongside fundamental changes. Our simulation results confirm that optimistic investor sentiment can mitigate the magnitude of negative stock market price movements triggered by adverse fundamental changes. Our model also indicates that the stock market price level may exhibit higher volatility than can be attributed to fundamental changes.Research limitations/implicationsOur study only briefly touches on the origins of shifts in investor sentiment by introducing a self-fulfilling feedback loop from the average stock market price level to investor sentiment. In future research, we will identify other key factors contributing to shifts in investor sentiment and subsequently analyze their influence on investor sentiment.Practical implicationsOur findings carry practical implications for recent and future movements in the US stock market. For instance, despite the Federal Reserve’s continuous interest rate hikes since March 2022, the overall optimistic investor sentiment has helped mitigate a severe downward movement in the stock market. However, in the absence of clear indications of a loose monetary policy, a rapid shift of investor sentiment from optimism to pessimism in the US stock market could potentially lead to a historic stock market crash.Originality/valueWhile the significance of investor sentiment in shaping stock market price dynamics, particularly regarding cross-sectional variations of stock returns, is widely recognized, quantifying directly its impact on the average stock market price level has remained a persistent challenge. Only very limited literature has delved into this subject, often hindered by a lack of theoretical support or yielding inconsistent results.","PurposeA novel psychology-based framework is proposed to investigate the causes of stock market crashes.Design/methodology/approachOur approach builds upon the dynamic capital mobility model, expanding it by incorporating bidirectional relationships between investor sentiment and the average stock market price level.

The development contained an expert focus group, expert panel, two pilot tests at four and five airports, respectively, and one full-scale study at nine Swedish commercial airports. The final instrument comprised 12 dimensions grounded in previous safety culture and climate research, and targeting three organizational levels. It had good psychometric properties and was validated against compliant as well as participative security behavior. We believe ADSECQ is suitable to evaluate the aerodrome security climate standard, pinpoint security climate areas for improvement, and evaluate the effect of interventions.","Large numbers of passengers and large amounts of goods are transported by air every year.

345,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,State-Based Analysis of General Aviation Loss of Control Accidents Using Historical Data and Pilots’ Perspectives,"General Aviation (GA) encompasses all aircraft operations, excluding scheduled, military, and commercial operations. GA accidents comprise approximately 94% of all aviation accidents in the United States annually. 75% of these accidents involve pilot-related factors (pilot actions or conditions). Inflight loss of control means that the flight crew was unable to maintain control of the aircraft in flight. With almost 50% of loss of control accidents being fatal yearly, it continues to be the deadliest cause of GA accidents.The most common approach to understanding accident causation is analyzing historical data from sources such as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database. The NTSB database has abundant rich information. In contrast to the extensive investigations into and detailed reports on commercial aviation accidents, GA accident investigations tend to be shorter, and the resulting reports tend to be brief and limited—especially regarding human factors’ role in accidents. Only relying on historical data cannot provide a complete understanding of accident causation.There is a clear need to better understand the role of human factors involved in GA accidents to prevent such accidents and thus improve aviation safety. In my research, I focus on a specific type of accidents, inflight loss of control (LOC-I), the deadliest cause of GA accidents. I use historical data analysis and human-subjects research with pilots to investigate the role of human factors in loss of control accidents. Building on previous work, I created a state-based modeling framework that maximizes data extraction and insight formation from the NTSB accident reports by (1) developing a structured modeling language to represent accident causation in the form of states and triggers; (2) populating the language lexicon of states and triggers using insights from accident reports and pilots perspectives via surveys and interviews; and (3) applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automatically translate accident narratives into the language lexicon. The framework is focused on LOC-I but can be extended to other types of accidents. Findings from my study may help in consistent accident analysis, better accident reporting, and improving training methods and operating procedures for GA pilots.","General Aviation (GA) encompasses all aircraft operations, excluding scheduled, military, and commercial operations.

346,2019,PQDT - Global,A Comparative Study of Sleep Architecture During Daytime Sleep Induced by Two Different Doses of Zolpidem,"Introduction:In the modern time aviation operations, an aircrew has to fly at day/night, across different time zones and constantly rotate the work schedules. The detrimental effects of fatigue are well known to affect adversely both physical and physiological well being of the aviator. These negative effects of fatigue cause performance decrement of an aircrew and thus increase the threat to air safety. So, the primary factor in the line of fatigue, the ‘Sleep’, needs to addressed. Pharmacological interventions are effective in achieving good sleep both in quality and quantity. Hypnotics like Zolpidem are given for inducing sleep and maintaining post awake alertness and studies have shown that they can induce sleep in short time and maintain post awake alertness. The results of the study would help in recommending the practical usage of Zolpidem in pharmacological management of fatigue.Methodology:20 healthy male volunteers participated in the study. A double blind repeated measure study design was adopted.The participants were advised to follow the instructions explained to them so that they are not in the influence of alcohol/caffeine during the conduct of study, which could influence the outcome of study. The study protocol involved analysis of sleep pattern using EEG. A baseline EEG of the subjects was recorded prior to the day of the study to assess the normal sleep pattern. On the day of study, the participants were advised to report to their normal place of work and do only routine works not involving strenuous activities. They were advised to report to the sleep lab at 1200 h. Following drug intake, they were made to sleep in the controlled environment of sleep lab at IAM, during which continuous recording of EEG was done using the Polysomnogram.Three different sessions were carried out on each participant, each session separated by at least 72 hours gap. In the initial session, baseline EEG was recorded. In the remaining two sessions, the participants were given either Zolpidem 5 mg or Zolpidem10 mg tablet.Results:The present study examined the effects of two different doses of Zolpidem (5 & 10 mg) on sleep architecture during daytime sleep. Zolpidem, in both the dosages was found to have an impact in augmenting the Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency & NREM sleep and in decreasing the REM sleep and Sleep Latency thereby providing a good quality sleep.Conclusion:Zolpidem is found to be hypnotically active at 5 mg dosage. The dosage for use as a fatigue countermeasure may be revised from the existing recommendation (5 mg for women and 10 mg for men) to 5 mg universally after substantiating the result of the present study with further studies with larger study groups.","Introduction:In the modern time aviation operations, an aircrew has to fly at day/night, across different time zones and constantly rotate the work schedules.

347,2015,PQDT - Global,"The Next Level : Video Gaming, Cognition and Motivation in Surgical Simulator Training","Image guided surgery uses small incisions or existing entry ports of the body in order to decrease surgical trauma which will hopefully lead to less infections, complications and number of days needed in the hospital. It is associated with great difficulties and a steep learning curve due to several reasons such as inverted movements and 2D representation of the operating area. In order to excel in minimal invasive surgery a large amount of training is required which has spurred the rise of virtual reality (VR) surgical simulators offering a safetraining environment with the possibility of customized scenarios and quantifiable feedback. Another advantage with VR simulators is easily conducted research due to objective assessment of performance and standardized task content and scenarios. Previous research has identified visual-spatial ability, the ability to mentally rotate and manipulate objects as well as visual working memory, the ability to hold visual information during a delay and recall that information, to be important for simulator training and performance. Video gaming experience has also been identified as an important background factor. This thesis consists of work derived from four studies that all take advantage of VR simulators as a tool for investigating which individual factors are needed for performance and training of minimal invasive surgery and whether or not they can be altered. In the first study the hypothesis was that the importance of visual-spatial ability (VSA) and visual working memory (VWM) would differ with different simulator task content. 25 subjects were tested for VSA, VWM and performance in three different simulators. A multivariate analysis showed that the importance differed; one task seemed to be more visually loaded than the others. That result was followed up in study II that examined whether it was possible to actually improve simulator performance by video game training and if the transfer effect differed according to simulator and video game task content. 30 subjects were matched and randomized into training with a 2D chess game or a 3D first person shooter game for five weeks, pre and posttraining subjects were tested with two different simulators. A control group consisting of 10subjects was also tested. There was a transfer effect, surprisingly also from the 2D game. Suspicions about a general cognitive workload lead to the aim in study III that investigated whether simulator performance would predict written examinations results. 158 subjects were tested in a simulator and a written examination in basic surgery. There was a performance examination correlation in female but not male subjects, which lead to study IV that investigated the role of motivation for surgical performance. In study IV, 30 subjects were tested for motivation while training in a surgical simulator. Motivation as defined by the self determination theory correlated only in male subjects to performance when highly motivated medical students were examined. It appeared to be less important for performance than visual spatial ability. Training in surgical simulators enhanced subjects’ interest in choosing surgery as a future work field. The thesis identifies the importance of certain background factors and suggests alternate means of minimal invasive training that will meet the requirements of tomorrow´s surgeons, taking surgical training to the next level.","Image guided surgery uses small incisions or existing entry ports of the body in order to decrease surgical trauma which will hopefully lead to less infections, complications and number of days needed in the hospital.

351,2017,PQDT - Global,Understanding Procedural Violations and Their Implications for Patient Safety in Community Pharmacies,"Background: Violations occur when individuals choose to bypass or deviate from procedures. Although violations are often not intended to cause harm, they are nevertheless breaches of the preferred way of working. Violations have been suggested to introduce risk into the environment by eroding the margin of safety. Therefore, violations are of potential concern to healthcare professionals that are responsible for patient safety. This thesis examines how and why violations occur in community pharmacies. Method: The research adopted a mixed methods approach to explore violations in community pharmacies and three studies were undertaken. The first study was a qualitative study that explored the views of management and frontline staff with regards to the prevailing safety culture in community pharmacies. The aim was to understand the context in which violations occur and to explore the goals that staff manage in practice. The second interview study explored how procedures are perceived in practice and the types of violations that occur in this setting. The third study utilised a survey based on the COM-B model that further explored the influence of capability, opportunity and motivation on violating behaviours. Results: Overall, findings demonstrated that numerous types of violations occur in community pharmacies. Mainly they occur either to ensure that timely patient care is provided or to ensure that productivity is maintained in practice. The safety culture study suggested that frontline staff and management have a different safety culture, with frontline staff reacting to risk in the moment and head office staff managing risk through the provision of multiple detailed procedures. The interviews suggested that procedures are useful for outlining what is expected of staff in practice; however they are not always possible to follow to the letter due to the complex working environment. The social norm within each pharmacy was suggested to influence violating behaviours, as was the professional judgement of the pharmacist. Violations were shown to be necessary for maintaining care at times, especially in exceptional circumstances. However, at times violations to maintain productivity did result in an increased risk to patient safety. The questionnaire study highlighted motivation, opportunity, length of experience, staff role and gender as influences on certain types of violations. Conclusions: The mixed methods utilised as part of this thesis revealed the types of violations that occur in community pharmacies and the reasons why pharmacists and support staff choose to violate. The findings led to recommendations for policymakers to evaluate how procedures are implemented in practice, to provide additional support for staff in practice through improved workflow, to provide patient safety specific training in pharmacies, to improve communication between frontline and head office staff and to educate pharmacy students regarding the possibility that they will need to violate procedures at times to manage the complex reality of working within community pharmacies.","Background: Violations occur when individuals choose to bypass or deviate from procedures.

Data was collected from 638 students prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 1) and 637 students after universities resumed in-person classes after the onset of the pandemic (Study 2) and analyzed separately. In both studies, helicopter parenting was negatively associated with academic well-being and school engagement through academic entitlement (externalized responsibility). Differences between studies emerged such that helicopter parenting was associated with academic-related outcomes through both psychological entitlement and academic entitlement (entitled expectations) only in the post-onset of COVID-19 sample. Psychological entitlement was associated with better academic well-being and school engagement in models, contrary to hypotheses. We suggest ways these findings can be incorporated into interventions designed to address helicopter parenting and support college students.HighlightsHelicopter parenting relates to emerging adult’ academic outcomes via academic entitlement.Academic entitlement negatively relates to academic outcomes for emerging adults.Psychological entitlement relates to better academic outcomes for emerging adults.Relations among helicopter parenting, entitlement, and academic outcomes differed between pre- and post-onset of COVID 19 samples.",Helicopter parenting can detrimentally impact college student outcomes.

365,2018,Homeland Security Affairs,Fighting The Fire In Our Own House: How Poor Decisions Are Smoldering Within the U.S. Fire Service,"Oftentimes, organizations declare employees to be their greatest asset. Workers engaging with others in their insular workplace achieve organizational goals through collaboration, and establishing and developing a localized work ethos. However, when work processes are strained by supervisory production demands, performance of the local workgroup can adjust to accept risk that makes safety negotiable.[1] Incremental and leisurely erosion of safety-centric workplace processes can influence and drive an entire institution to analyze and perform actions under aberrant decision-making frameworks. This thesis seeks to understand how high-risk occupations, especially the U.S. fire service, potentially adopt and eventually contend with the normalization of deviance.The concept of normalizing deviance within high-risk vocations was first examined in depth after the 1986 space shuttle Challenger disaster by sociologist Diane Vaughan. Vaughan’s analysis of the tragedy disclosed several sociological failures within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that contributed to poor decision-making.[2]At the organizational level, normalization of deviance elucidates the social construct of workplace catastrophes.[3] Decisions that would otherwise appear illogical outside NASA were seemingly rational inside the agency, as the boundaries of normality had been widened to accommodate incremental failures and near misses now fell within the boundaries of acceptable performance.[4] Delineating between unsafe acts, near misses, incidents, and accidents is crucial to understanding the escalation of occurrences, and their cumulative effect upon an organization.[5] Additionally, understanding how organizations are structured and operate, from either a linear or complex construct, provides a level of clarity as to potential problems encountered. Furthermore, the belief that organizations can conceivably exist in a pre-accident period, called an incubation period, is examined for legitimacy.[6]Another major theme explored is the abstraction known as a drift into failure. This framework suggests that organizations methodically and slowly make incremental changes that direct the organization towards the boundaries of safety, which challenges those borders with increasing frequency.[7] A reviewed accident causation model is the Swiss Cheese Model, which seeks to define the conception of defense in depth, and how active and latent failure pathways can defeat such protective layering.[8] Finally, consideration is given to the idea of the overall effects of either loose or tight coupling on organizations; specifically how these organizational characteristics can either help or hinder business continuity and operations.[9]Chapter IV delves into whether normalization of deviance exists within high-risk organizations. The principle of production over safety as a stark reality encountered by high-risk organizations, and its contributive effect on workplace justification of shortcuts are examined. Shortcuts sometimes give rise to satisficing, implying that people choose an easier way as opposed to the best way to solve a problem.[10] Structural secrecy as an insulating mechanism against outside influence is considered as influential to promoting normalized deviance.[11] To evaluate the U.S. fire service effectively and fairly, and particularly the Dallas Fire Rescue Department (DFRD), evaluative criteria are established to determine whether normalization of deviance exists in the fire service.The fifth chapter opens up with a discussion of annual firefighter Line of Duty Death (LODD) statistics that reveal consistent mortality rates despite innovations within the fire service industry, such as the Incident Command System.[12] Decision-making paradigms on the fireground are examined that might explain perpetual LODD, including violations of existing rules and regulations that place firefighters at elevated risk of injury or death. Loss of situational awareness is reviewed as a possible factor in fireground injury or death.[13] The concepts of both goal seduction and situation aversion are analyzed to verify if either advance unsafe fireground actions.[14] Next, the idea of a safety culture within the fire service is inspected and how a firefighter’s identity is based on both internal and external influences.[15]The sixth chapter specifically examines the DFRD for instances of institutionalized deviance in its internal documents and training resources used in both initial and operating platforms. After action reports (AARs), in addition to manuals of procedures and standard operating procedures are reviewed. Also, a study of almost 2,000 injury claims over a 17-year period is reviewed. Finally, specific instances of safety breaches are analyzed for conformity to firefighting best practices. The chapter concludes with a review of documents external to the DFRD and their potential relevance to the overall discussion of permitting deviant mindsets on the fireground.The final chapter seeks to draw conclusions and offer specific recommendations to assist the DFRD in restraining normalized deviance. Four conclusions and three recommendations are presented that provide pragmatic solutions to outstanding issues. Conclusions range from initiating in-depth studies of near miss incidents and increasing overall situational awareness, to an acceptance that organizational drift towards failure is manifest within the fire service in general and the DRFD in particular. Recommendations include accepting a resilience engineering approach to understanding accidents by embracing a modified risk matrix model that aligns more with the reality actually observed. Next, a proposal to initiate an anonymous near-miss reporting system is examined, including a draft form that captures incidents that occur more frequently than accidents. Quantifying and documenting such events can scope the size of the issues leading to the near miss. Lastly, the recommendation to summarize and document more everyday incidents in an abbreviated AAR is suggested, including a shortened AAR form that can be collected and analyzed.In closing, the thesis seeks to understand how deviant behaviors progress to such a degree that they actually persuade how unsafe work is performed in high-risk occupations. Focusing on the fire service, normalization of deviance is the tragic end state of a long-term turning of a blind eye to workplace productivity over safety coupled with an almost unabated allowance of local workgroups to construct dangerous subcultures that are permitted to thrive. While the fire service has the public perception of being quintessential risk takers in limited situations, normalizing and allowing risk to infiltrate the mundane decision making paradigm of the firefighting profession is a dreadful thought. The recommendations of the thesis advance practical solutions that ideally expose organizational drift into failure before a more systemic normalization of deviance settles into the fire service organization.[1] David L.

It suggests two sets of variables related to learning: learning style composition and group process. Composition was measured with Kolb's (1999) Learning Style Inventory Version 3. Group processes measured include efficacy, psychological safety, satisfaction, conflict resolution, identity, cohesion, and agreement. Results of a study of 62 short term project groups are reported. Groups were engaged in a time constrained ill-structured problem-solving exercise based on a modified version of King and Kitchener's (1994) model of reflective judgement and critical thinking. Thematic analysis of group written responses yields a three level model of integrative complexity that serves as a proxy measure for learning and provides a qualitative, short answer questionnaire to measure integrative complexity in groups. Results of statistical analyses support that learning results from a combination of the learning style composition and group process. Data show that integrative complexity in groups is related to the individual learning style composition of groups and to shared perceptions of the group. Learning style composition and the shared perceptions of the group related to learning account for as much as 46% of the variance in integrative complexity. Learning style is most related to the difference in moving from level 1 to level 2 integrative complexity, and shared perceptions are most related to moving from level 2 to level 3. Further, while certain shared perceptions are common to integrative complexity in all groups, learning style composition of a group is related to the unique shared perceptions that emerge in groups faced with a time-constrained, ill-structured problem-solving task. Factor analysis on the LSI show support for a two factor solution and support factor analysis of ipsitive measures.

368,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A Computational Approach to Situation Awareness and Mental Models in Aviation,"1.1 MotivationAlthough most modern, highly-computerized flight decks are known to be robust to small disturbances and failures, humans still play a crucial role in advanced decision making in off-nominal situations, and accidents still occur because of poor human-automation interaction. In complex safety critical human integrated systems, loss of control or automation surprises often trace their origin to disparities between the human agent’s mental representation of a system and the actual states/dynamics of the system and its environment. In addition to the physical state of the environment, operators now have to extend their awareness to the state of the automation itself which supposes an active monitoring action. To guarantee the accuracy of this knowledge, humans need to know the dynamics or approximate versions of the dynamics that rule the automation. A general insight about Newton’s laws and good monitoring skills are no longer sufficient to guarantee completely safe behaviors of such systems involving complex automation-human interactions. Comprehensive and detailed training about automated flight systems is also not sufficient since an excessive complexity might still lead the pilot to misunderstand the automation’s behavior.The operator’s situation awareness can decline because of a deficient mental model of the aircraft and an excessive workload. A local absence of knowledge or some confusion due to too much complexity can be responsible for a faulty mental model.Excessive workload can be caused by the operator’s attempt to understand the automation’s complex behavior in off-nominal situations or by a poorly designed partition of tasks. Generally, automated systems and related training programs should be analyzed in the light of their impact on the operator’s mental model and situation awareness.Usual mechanisms to investigate the influence of new automation on human automation interaction includes extensive use of simulation and human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimentation. But HITL experiments are expensive, time-consuming and consequently can only evaluate a limited set of scenarios. Therefore we need to improve our simulation capabilities by developing realistic, computational human agent models that account for human limitations.This work describes the creation of a computational human agent model simulating the cognitive constructs of situation awareness and mental models known to capture the symptoms of poor human-automation interaction and provide insight into more comprehensive metrics supporting the validation of automated systems in aviation.1.2 RequirementsConcepts of mental models and situation awareness are broad and ill-defined in the literature. To address a computational approach, this work will need to clearly define and scope the terminology. As situation awareness and mental models will be modeled and implemented to support the simulation of HAI as comprehensively as possible, the operational definition of these concepts will project theoretical notions onto a set of computational objects. The implementation should allow the analysis of aviation incidents such as the crash of the flight AF 447 which gives important examples of poor human-automation interaction, excessive workload, lacunary mental models and resulting low situation awareness. Such a case study can therefore be used to provide a list of requirements, scope concepts and define objectives about what needs to be included in the computational agent model. The accident report of the Bureau dEtudes des Accidents (BEA) mentions the unusually high workload throughout the document.","1.1 MotivationAlthough most modern, highly-computerized flight decks are known to be robust to small disturbances and failures, humans still play a crucial role in advanced decision making in off-nominal situations, and accidents still occur because of poor human-automation interaction.

369,1999,PQDT - Global,Niche Channels : A Study on Status and Trends in India,"The purpose of this study is to study the trends of viewership of niche channels in India. The scope of the study is restricted to Music Channels, Information Channels(Discovery) and News Channels(Star News).Secondary research was carried out by studying the trends of ratings and channel share of these channels from INTAM across of two periods of Jan'98- Mar'98 and Nov'98-Jan'99. The target audience was SEC A & B, 15-24 years and 25-34 years.Primary research was conducted among 10 media planners, 40 households and two channel marketers.The analysis of ratings showed that the ratings for these channels peaked during prime-time which in India is the time when TV viewing is the highest. The ratings are higher for weekends then for weekdays.The most favourable time-band for Discovery is from 8:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m. for all the target audiences studied. Ratings have shown a considerable increase across the two periods for Discovery and MTV. Ratings for Channel V have seen a considerable decline during this period. The peak ratings across music channels correspond to Hindi music programmingThe survey among the media planners showed that from a broad perspective niche channels can be defined by the genres of programming, which means there are certain kinds of programming preferred by certain segments of the audience. Thus these channels cater to a Particular need of that small segment of the audience. The role of these channels is to provide an environment, for qualitative factors that go beyond numbers and to provide additional reach within a particular reach more cost effectively as compared to popular, general entertainment channels.In-spite of all the reasons cited by the media planners, advertising on these channels still seems to be guided by the good deals offered by them and their marketing efforts.The survey conducted among the viewers showed that Discovery was emerging as a preferred channel for males both in the 15-24 years and in 25-34 years age group. The core audience for music in terms of preference of programming was the youth(15-24 years). Among the music channels MTV was the Top of mind channel followed by Channel V and Music Asia. Although ratings for Music Asia are higher than Channel V, it was not mentioned as a preferred channel by the youth as it as a down-market image in this audience. Music as a genre was also doing well among 25-34 years females with MTV taking the lead again, followed by Music Asia and Channel V lagging behind.Discovery has aspirational value for viewers in India. It is a channel which they like to say they watch but, as of now, actual viewership is much lower than claimed viewership. As far as news channels are concerned the core audience was 25-34 years males. Star News emerged as the most popular news both for its content as well as presentation followed by . DD1 still retains its credibility for the national news. The 7:00-7:30p.m. and the 9:00-9:30p.m. day-parts are doing the best for Star News channel","The purpose of this study is to study the trends of viewership of niche channels in India. The scope of the study is restricted to Music Channels, Information Channels(Discovery) and News Channels(Star News).Secondary research was carried out by studying the trends of ratings and channel share of these channels from INTAM across of two periods of Jan'98- Mar'98 and Nov'98-Jan'99. The target audience was SEC A & B, 15-24 years and 25-34 years.Primary research was conducted among 10 media planners, 40 households and two channel marketers.The analysis of ratings showed that the ratings for these channels peaked during prime-time which in India is the time when TV viewing is the highest.","<title>Niche Channels : A Study on Status and Trends in India</title> <excerpt>The purpose of this study is to study the trends of viewership of niche channels in India.

This paper examines how two novel requirements scenarios-Selectivity and Post-completion Error-can trigger developers to introduce defects into programs. These scenarios are grounded in psychological theories of human error and are not addressed by conventional requirements quality standards. A case study was conducted to investigate whether and how these human errorbased criteria manifest in real-world aviation industry projects. The study analyzed ten aviation-related software systems, with defect data collected by an independent third-party testing center during certification tests. The results indicate that violations of the proposed criteria in requirements specifications do, in fact, lead to corresponding errors during the design and coding phases. Based on these findings, we recommend incorporating these two criteria to proactively prevent and detect software defects.","Conference Title: 2025 IEEE 36th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)Conference Start Date: 2025 Oct. 21Conference End Date: 2025 Oct. 21Conference Location: São Paulo, BrazilSoftware requirements specifications play a critical role in ensuring the reliability of software systems.","<title>Two Requirements Scenarios That Trigger Human Errors in Software Development: a Case Study in the Aviation Industry</title> <excerpt>Conference Title: 2025 IEEE 36th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)Conference Start Date: 2025 Oct. 21Conference End Date: 2025 Oct. 21Conference Location: São Paulo, BrazilSoftware requirements specifications play a critical role in ensuring the reliability of software systems.</excerpt>"
371,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Developing a Training Program for the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System in Context,"The Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is an aircraft collision avoidance system designed to prevent mid-air collisions. During an advisory, danger is imminent, and TCAS is assumed to have better, more up-to-date information than the ground operated air traffic control (ATC) facility. Following a TCAS RA is generally the safe course of action during an advisory. However, pilot compliance with RAs is surprisingly low. Results from a TCAS monitoring study show pilots are not complying with many TCAS advisories. As revealed by pilot-submitted Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports, this noncompliance could be attributed, in part, to pilot confusion to TCAS operation as well as misunderstandings of the appropriate response to a TCAS issued advisory.This thesis details the development and evaluation of a TCAS training program intended to improve pilots’ understanding of TCAS use for collision avoidance in a range of traffic situations. The training program integrated Demonstration Based and Event Based Training techniques. Its efficacy was analyzed in an integrated ATC-cockpit simulator study in which eighteen commercial airline pilots were asked to complete the TCAS training program and afterwards experienced twelve experimental traffic events. The trained pilots’ performance was compared to the performance of 16 baseline pilots who did not receive the modified training.Overall, the training program did have a significant impact on the pilots’ behavior and response to TCAS advisories. The measure Time Pilots First Achieved Compliance decreased with the trained pilots, as did the measure Autopilot Disconnect Time AfterA Initiation. Trained pilots exhibited less aggressive performance in response to a TCAS RA (including a decrease in the measures Altitude Deviation Over Duration Of RA, Average Vertical Rate Difference, Maximum Vertical Rate Difference, and Maximum Vertical Rate). The measure Percent Compliance did not significantly vary between trained and baseline pilots, although trained pilots had a more consistent response in the traffic event with conflicting ATC guidance. Finally, on the postexperiment questionnaires, pilots commented on their increase in understanding of TCAS as well as an increase in their trust in the advisory system.Results of this research inform TCAS training objectives provided by the FAA as well as the design of TCAS training. Additionally, conclusions extend more broadly to improved training techniques for other similar complex, time-critical situations.","The Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is an aircraft collision avoidance system designed to prevent mid-air collisions.

This lag is nowhere more noticeable than in the field of criminal law and criminal jurisdiction as applied to civil aircraft . Crimes that are committed on board the aircraft will include crimes like assault, theft and unruly behaviour . A common dominator amongst these crimes is that the rules dealing with jurisdiction pose a significant source of controversy. Early expressions of the criminal conduct in international flights exposed lacunae in air law, which international lawyers are struggling to fill . Because of this lacuna, as familiar problems present themselves in changing ways, therefore there is a need for a regime governing crimes in the air to be continuously reassessed and developed. In the last years, it became apparent that no rules exist for misbehaviour on board the aircraft in flight , rules governing the exercise of jurisdiction over common crimes in airspace and onboard the aircraft are sophisticated and unsettled.","The law has yet to catch up adequately with conventional aviation.

In this study, we aim to help clarify the mixed results in the literature regarding the psychological outcomes of helicopter parenting in emerging adulthood by examining the processes underlying the relationship between helicopter parenting and psychological adjustment in the Korean context. Using a diverse sample of Korean emerging adults, we investigated the relationships among perceived helicopter parenting, parent–child affection, pressure from parental career expectations, and psychological adjustment (depressive symptoms and life satisfaction). The data came from 562 Korean emerging adults (269 women and 293 men) aged 19–34 years who were either full-time students or unemployed and unmarried and had at least one living parent. The structural equation modeling used in this study revealed that higher levels of helicopter parenting were directly associated with greater depressive symptoms. Higher levels of helicopter parenting also had an indirect relationship with greater depressive symptoms through higher levels of pressure from parental career expectations. However, higher levels of helicopter parenting were indirectly linked to better psychological adjustment (fewer depressive symptoms, greater satisfaction with life) through higher levels of parent–child affection. Our results indicate that in the East Asian context, helicopter parenting could be related to both negative and positive psychological outcomes depending on the mediating factors.","Examining helicopter parenting in a Confucian culture that values parental authority and involvement can extend previous helicopter parenting research that has mostly focused on a U.S. college student context.

374,2008,PQDT - Global,To Study the Chances in Cognitive and Psychomotor Performance After Acute Sleep Deprivation and Subsequent Heat Stress,"Background & Objectives:There is evidence to suggest that combination of different stresses may result in effects which differ from effects of individual stresses. Sleep deprivation and heat stress affect cognitive and psychomotor performance in varying degree. This study was conducted with a view to examine the changes in cognitive and psychomotor performance after acute sleep deprivation of one night and subsequent heat stress for an hour and also to compare the changes in performance due to dual stress of sleep deprivation to that of sleep deprivation alone.Method:Cognitive and psychomotor performance of 20 healthy males randomly divided into two groups (Group A and Group B) of ten each was assessed using PC based visual Working Memory & Vigilance tasks and Finger Dexterity Board Task, after routine normal sleep on Day1 (Stage I) and after acute sleep deprivation of one night on Day2 (Stage II) taking two subjects at a time. Then it was assessed on Day2 itself after exposing Group B subject to heat stress of 33.9oC WBGT for an hour and after keeping Group A subject just awake for this extended period (Stage III). Data was analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA, Bonferroni Correction and 2x3 Fisher Exact Test.Results:Significant difference was observed in response time on Working Memory Task in both the groups (p=0.006 for Group A & 0.028 for Group B). Post hoc analysis revealed significant shortening of response time from Stage II to stage III in both the groups, whereas only in Group A from Stage I to II. Correct responses on Working memory Task decreased significantly in Group A (p=0.006) only, from Stage I to Stage II. There was no significant variation within and between both the groups performance on Vigilance Task. Significant prolongation of time taken to complete Finger Dexterity Task was seen only in Group A (p=0.015), but not in Group B (p=0.155). Post hoc analysis of Group A data revealed that ‘time taken’ prolonged significantly only from Stage I to Stage II. No significant difference was seen in pattern of change in performance between the groups.Interpretation & Conclusion:The significant shortening of response time from stage II to Stage III in Group B can not be interpreted as effect of heat only because other group also showed similar reduction without heat and therefore it can be attributed to ‘time of day’, arousal, motivation or to effect of some other unaccounted factors. Non finding of significant variation within Group B on any other performance parameters may also be interpreted as robustness (low susceptibility to effects of sleep deprivation) of Group B subjects. Acute sleep deprivation of one night with subsequent heat stress has not been found to cause any significant changes in cognitive and psychomotor performance as measured by Working Memory & Vigilance tasks and Finger Dexterity board task respectively.","Background & Objectives:There is evidence to suggest that combination of different stresses may result in effects which differ from effects of individual stresses.

375,2019,PQDT - UK & Ireland,"Whitehall Warriors: The Political Fight for the Royal Air Force, 1917–29","Founded in the heat of public pressure to respond to German bombardment, the creation of the RAF merged naval and military air services into an independent force months before the end of the First World War. This heralded the arrival of three-way inter-service competition and the RAF faced successive assaults on its independence post-war. Many scholarly works have focused on the doctrinal and economic arguments made by the RAF’s leadership in its defence. The significance of the RAF’s lack of history in the context of the period and how the ‘Whitehall Warriors’ at the Air Ministry harnessed that to their advantage remains unexplored.This gap will be addressed by critically evaluating the intentions and actions of the Air Ministry’s senior leaders in order to interrogate their political understanding of the significance of creating and promoting a distinctive RAF culture. The RAF’s novelty, it will be argued, predisposed the Ministry to use the subtler arts of influence, political lobbying, and the promotion of the young service to the public. Meanwhile, escalating inter-service competition encouraged the Air Ministry to take a politically aggressive attitude to its rivals.This thesis will analyse the tensions between tradition and modernity, characteristic of the era and central to the Air Ministry’s challenge. It will investigate the Ministry itself: its status, relations with the establishment and the press, and the networks it used to further the RAF’s cause. A framework of identity, space, time, and power will be used as a methodology for understanding how the RAF created a resilient culture, underpinned by strong foundations and operational experience. This thesis reassesses inter-service rivalry, arguing that virulent attacks on the RAF aided its transition from a fledgling force to a secure one. This offers a new cultural perspective on competition between the armed services in the inter-war years.","Founded in the heat of public pressure to respond to German bombardment, the creation of the RAF merged naval and military air services into an independent force months before the end of the First World War.

378,2002,PQDT - Global,Stress Management in Army Aviation and an Empirical Assessment of Aircrew Stress,"There are many factors that affect our psychical, psychological, and behavioral condition. One of them is stress. Although today living without stress is almost impossible, sources of stress and its remedies vary with respect to job variation and individual perceptions. Aviation sector is one of the professions that have severe and continuous stress.Stress is an inevitable factor in a pilot's life. Its level affects performance as too much stress may detract from the pilot's ability; and not enough stress may cause boredom, less concentration and motivation.It has long been recognized that Army Pilots at all levels are subject to stress on and off the job, which can interfere with effective and efficient job performance as well as job satisfaction. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the causes of stress and their symptoms in pilots` life. The thesis is also intended to find the styles used by pilots to cope with stress conditions.For this reason a questionnaire was developed and administered to 121 aircrew members of Army Aviation School and Training Center Command. The questionnaire involves questions on the causes of stress, the ways to cope with stress conditions, and stress symptoms. After decreasing the number of variables by using factor analysis, scores on 24 scales within these 3 categories (causes of stress, coping styles, symptoms) were quantified and analyzed using descriptive analysis and correlation to reveal problem areas, strengths, and interrelationships. Recommendations also focused on how to use this information by the unit command to guide all efforts in minimizing unnecessary stress and to optimize crewmembers' ability to cope.","There are many factors that affect our psychical, psychological, and behavioral condition.

379,2021,PQDT - Global,Task Engagement and Flow in the Operational Safety of South African Civil Air Traffic Controllers,"The field of research on human factors has grown rapidly, partly as a result of the importance of ensuring safety in aviation. Human factors, specifically human errors, contribute to significantly more aviation incidents than any other single factor, accounting for approximately 70% of all accidents and incidents (US National Research Council, 1998). Therefore, in order to continue to improve safety despite increasing air traffic, it is crucial to identify the factors that are the constituents of safety before their absence leads to an incident. This research focused on the human errors made by civil air traffic controller officers (ATCOs) during the high-risk period of shift handover. The aim of the current research was to obtain a deeper understanding of these factors in the South African context.The profession of air traffic control involves a wide array of duties to ensure that aircraft take off, transit between airports, and land safely. Air Traffic Navigation Services (ATNS) have identified a pattern of increased safety incidents that occur within the first 30 minutes of a civil ATCO starting a shift, the first 30 minutes after a civil ATCO returns from a break, and the last 30 minutes of his or her shift. This is referred to as the ‘shift handover period’. ATNS posited that the problem is a lack of mental alertness in ATCOs. The current research aimed to make a contribution to the knowledge and understanding of human factors that play a role in the underlying dynamics of mental alertness, mental task engagement, and flow in ATCOs during this high-risk shift-handover period, in order to assist in minimising safety incidents.The present study investigated the systemic, psychological, and physiological human factors experienced by ATCOs in South Africa.The research was conducted in three phases:Phase 1: Review and analysis of safety incident reports;Phase 2: Examining flow, mental task engagement, and mental workload; andPhase 3: Administering interventions: music and mindfulness.In Phase 1, a total of 123 safety incident reports for the period 2008 to 2012 were analysed. The analysis confirmed that the handover period is indeed a high-risk period.In Phase 2, qualitative data were collected through interviews with11 ATCOs. This data, combined with factors identified from the safety reports, yielded a number of systemic, psychological, and physiological factors that impact the operational safety of ATCOs from a Safety-I perspective (why things go wrong).The high-risk sectors are Approach and Aerodrome. Periods of both high and low traffic volumes are high risk. A number of environmental upgrades are required, including equipment and the rest area, and noise levels need to be reduced. The rostering of ATCOs should be done to ensure sufficient staff, without extending their shifts, and ATCOs should be rostered sufficiently regularly to maintain proficiency. ATCOs require sufficient rest, which should be promoted, and management should ensure that ATCOs take their mandatory leave. From the interviews, it was clear that the relationship between management and ATCOs could be improved, especially through regular and open communication.","The field of research on human factors has grown rapidly, partly as a result of the importance of ensuring safety in aviation.

380,2012,PQDT - Global,Factors Affecting the Career Advancement of Female Air Traffic Controllers in the South African Air Traffic Control Industry,"Research shows that although the representation of women in the workforce has increased over the past couple of decades, there are many industries that still remain male dominated. In addition, it is generally known that such male-dominated industries have minimal female representation at their managerial levels. One such male-dominated industry in South Africa is the air traffic control (ATC) industry. Women represent about 30 percent of the industry, which suggest their status in the industry is still quite low.The purpose of this study was to examine male and female air traffic controllers’ perceptions of factors that facilitate and constrain women’s career advancement, and to determine whether there were any significant differences in their opinions. The study also identified what male and female air traffic controllers (ATCOs) think the industry can do to help prepare women for leadership positions in the industry, and how to eliminate barriers that may exist to women’s career advancement.Data for this study were collected through an online questionnaire adapted from Zhong’s (2006) study on a convenience sample (N = 147) of male and female ATCOs in South Africa. The data analysis was executed by using factor analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Content analysis was used to analyse the two open-ended questions.The findings from the ANOVA suggest that there were four significant gender differences in perceptions of the Personal effort/External support, Attitude/Internal character, Equity, and Family issues. There also were significant differences in opinion on External support/Personal effort, Attitude/Internal character, Equity and Family issues, depending on the number of children the respondents had, and significant differences of marital status on the External support/Personal effort and Family issues. Finally, significant differences were found in the years’ experience variable for Attitude/Internal character.In response to the open-ended questions, most of the respondents suggested that the ATC industry should offer training programmes to improve awareness of possible barriers within the industry, as well as to offer advice on how to overcome them and improve their leadership skills. This could be done by creating programmes on the knowledge and skills needed to advance one’s career or by providing mentors or role models.Future research could compare the perceptions of employees from different race groups and their perceptions of women’s career advancement in male-dominated industries. It is also recommended that researchers conduct in-depth qualitative interviews together with the current questionnaire to evaluate perceptions of the career advancement of women more critically.","Research shows that although the representation of women in the workforce has increased over the past couple of decades, there are many industries that still remain male dominated.

381,2016,PQDT - Global,Cohesion in Multiteam Systems : Effects of Type of Training and Adaptation Triggers on Levels of Social and Task Cohesion - An Experimental Study,"Verificou-se, na última década, uma expansão significativa da literatura sobre sistemas multiequipa, apontando-se a necessidade de melhor compreender a variável coesão nestes sistemas. Os sistemas multi-equipa operam frequentemente em ambientes extremos e imprevisíveis, que requerem treino especializado e elevados níveis de coesão. O efeito do treino sobre a coesão, ao nível dos multi-sistemas, é uma área de investigação que tem recebido pouca atenção. A presente investigação pretende colmatar esta lacuna ao investigar a variação nos níveis de coesão social e de tarefa afectada por tipo de treino, e na presença de um estímulo espontâneo indutor de stress. Para tal criou-se um desenho experimental 2x2 inter-sujeitos. Pediu-se aos participantes que imaginassem um cenário fictício onde fizessem parte de uma de duas equipas. Estas equipas estariam envolvidas num projecto de investigação. As condições foram manipuladas de modo a que ambas as equipas treinassem em conjunto, ou separadamente. Também foi manipulada uma situação de crise indutora de stress. Durante o projecto de investigação poderia ocorrer uma crise que afectaria a multiequipa, ou poderia não ocorrer. Seguidamente, os participantes tinham que responder a um questionário que media coesão social e de tarefa.

382,2023,PQDT - Global,Sleep in Automated Driving Post-Sleep Driver Performance in Transitions of Control – The Effects of Sleep Inertia,"Sleep emerges as a legal driver state in automated driving when highly automated driving is introduced to the market and as a misuse of automation already observable in partially automated driving. As long as full autonomy is not realized, the human driver will still be required to or voluntarily intervene in vehicle guidance at some point. Sleep inertia, the post-sleep performance decrement, is identified as a safety risk in domains of transportation where operators are allowed to nap onshift. Empirical evidence on the effects of sleep inertia on driver behaviour, however, is very limited. According to the ‘Activation Theory’, sleep inertia is marked by low arousal which is associated with slowed information processing and overall decreased performance capabilities. Evidence on the effects of sleep inertia on performance comes predominantly from experimental settings that use standardized tasks to assess the effects of sleep inertia on particular cognitive functions. One experimental study that aimed at investigating post-nap effects on driver behaviour takeover scenarios in automated driving was not conclusive due to the lack of a suitable experimental setup. In a first step, the presented thesis aims at creating a research environment that combines methods from sleep science with human factors research paradigms on automated driving to enable the investigation of post-sleep effects on driver behaviour. In Study 1 the manipulation of circadian as well as sleep-homeostatic factors proved highly successful to trigger sleep stage N2 in participants in a driving simulator setting. Sleep was measured with electroencephalography according to the international clinical standard. Additionally, cardiac and electrodermal measures showed good properties to detect sleep in drivers during automated driving. This finding is especially relevant for the development of driver monitoring systems that are able to detect a sleeping driver. After proving effective, the sleep paradigm of Study 1 was maintained for the following two studies. The main aim of the presented thesis was addressed in Study 2 and Study 3: The effects of sleep inertia on driver behaviour in transitions of control from automated to manual driving were investigated in a controlled setting. In Study 2, drivers were awakened during stable sleep while driving in automated mode and exposed to a takeover scenario. Compared to a condition after wakefulness, the drivers’ reactions in response to an RtI were delayed and drivers visually searched for more relevant cues to understand the situation. After sleep, more driving errors were coded in the transition of control phase and the drivers experienced the situation as unpleasant. After the transition, manual driving behaviour on the tracking control loop was impaired under sleep inertia (Study 3a). Under sleep inertia, drivers compensated for impaired performance by reducing the driving speed. Even though longitudinal and lateral vehicle guidance were more unstable under the state of sleepiness too, drivers did not compensate by reducing the driving speed (Study 3). A sub-sample of drivers that were questioned about their subjective experience of taking control back after sleep reported high stress and a feeling of grogginess. Drivers were aware of their restricted performance capabilities. The reported stress challenges the assumption that performance decrements due to sleep inertia are explained by an overall low arousal. The present findings suggest a complex relationship of arousal and performance in a transition of control under sleep inertia. The high physiological arousal is hypothesized to be linked to subjective stress in the takeover situation which reflects a state of high arousal. At the same time, the drivers’ cognitive processing is slowed due to a state of low neurophysiological arousal. Additionally, emotional and motivational factors are suggested to additionally shape driver behaviour after sleep. The findings of the present thesis suggest that in order for sleep to become a safe driver state, human machine interfaces have to account for performance impairments due to and a negative experience of sleep inertia in transitions of control. ","Sleep emerges as a legal driver state in automated driving when highly automated driving is introduced to the market and as a misuse of automation already observable in partially automated driving.

Some of these methods included ""pilot models,"" which are generally implemented in the form of transfer functions and are not necessarily cognitive in nature. Additionally, symbolic and connectionist pilot models have been developed to control the maneuvering of air vehicles. While some of these models have been successful, they are mostly focused on attitude control and do not take into account higher-level decisions such as attacking or chasing an opponent. The current modeling efforts in cognitive science do not provide enough information on the structure of those high-level decision-making processes. This study aims to create and test a dynamic cognitive fighter pilot model in a simulated environment that can make high-level decisions using the Neural Engineering Framework and employing spiking neuron models as encoding units. The model is connectionist, embodied, and situated and uses semantic pointers to decode the outputs into semantic wordings.

385,2018,PLoS One,Eye position affects flight altitude in visual approach to landing independent of level of expertise of pilot,"The present study addresses the effect of the eye position in the cockpit on the flight altitude during the final approach to landing. Three groups of participants with different levels of expertise (novices, trainees, and certified pilots) were given a laptop with a flight simulator and they were asked to maintain a 3.71° glide slope while landing. Each participant performed 40 approaches to the runway. During 8 of the approaches, the point of view that the flight simulator used to compute the visual scene was slowly raised or lowered with 4 cm with respect to the cockpit, hence moving the projection of the visible part of the cockpit down or up in the visible scene in a hardly noticeable manner. The increases and decreases in the simulated eye height led to increases and decreases in the altitude of the approach trajectories, for all three groups of participants. On the basis of these results, it is argued that the eye position of pilots during visual approaches is a factor that contributes to the risk of black hole accidents.","The present study addresses the effect of the eye position in the cockpit on the flight altitude during the final approach to landing.

386,2023,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Quantitative Analyses and Empirical Tests of Perceptual Theories of the Black Hole Illusion,"The Black Hole Illusion (BHI) is a nighttime aviation landing illusion where pilots overestimate their descent angle. The BHI occurs when only the outline of the runway is visible to pilots, usually at night with little illumination of the environment. This illusion is dangerous, as it causes pilots to perceive themselves at a high descent angle; and they compensate by flying lower, resulting in a possible crash into the ground or obstacles before the runway. A common interpretation of the BHI is that it represents a perceptual illusion, where the descent angle is misperceived. We quantitatively analyzed two different perceptual theories that predict pilots perceived descent angle during the BHI experience; and we also quantitatively analyzed another perceptual theory to apply during nighttime approaches to alleviate the disorientation experienced from the BHI. Of the first two theories, Perrone's algorithm (Perrone, 1983) predicts that the magnitude of the illusion should vary with runway width/length in nighttime conditions, compared to no illusion and no effect of runway width/length in daylight conditions. On the other hand, the eye-level algorithm (adapted from the work in Galanis, Jennings, and Beckett (1998) and Robinson, Williams, and Biggs (2020)) predicts that there should be no effect of runway width/length in either nighttime or daylight conditions. The last algorithm, the focus of expansion algorithm (adapted from the theory of Gibson (1950) and Gibson (1966)), details a way that pilots can obtain the landing position of their aircraft without estimating their angle of descent, thereby alleviating possible disorientation experienced during nighttime approaches. Additionally, we conducted three empirical studies: The first two aimed at testing Perrone's algorithm and the eye-level algorithm; and the third aimed at testing the focus of expansion algorithm. Across the first two empirical studies, we did demonstrate a BHI for the nighttime evaluations of descent angle; but the data did not support either algorithm. In the third empirical study, the data did not support the focus of expansion algorithm; however, we found that participants were more accurate with estimating the aircraft's landing position when the landing position was closer to the beginning of the runway. Overall, we conclude that the BHI may reflect general disorientation in conditions with limited information.","The Black Hole Illusion (BHI) is a nighttime aviation landing illusion where pilots overestimate their descent angle.

388,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,FSA Based Analysis of Deck Officers’ Non-Technical Skills in Crisis Situations,"A review of maritime accidents conducted in 2006 confirms that human error is the main contributing factor in maritime accidents. This study illustrates that major maritime accidents are not caused by technical problems but by failure of the crew to respond to the situation appropriately.Non-technical skills (NTS) encompass both interpersonal and cognitive skills such as situation awareness, teamwork, decision-making, leadership, managerial skills, communication and language skills, etc. In a crisis situation good NTS allow the deck officers to recognise a problem quickly and manage the situation and team safely and effectively. As a result, the evaluation and grading of deck officers’ NTS is necessary to assure safety at sea.This research aims to identify the links between maritime accidents and deck officers’ NTS and identifies significant criteria and their contributions to the deck officers’ NTS by using the Formal Safety Assessment concept. Taxonomy of deck officers’ non-technical skills was developed by conducting interviews with experts and collecting NTS weighting data for calculating each NTS weight by the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method.Based on the taxonomy of the deck officers NTS behavioural markers were developed for the assessment of their NTS in the bridge simulator. A set of bridge simulator crisis scenarios was developed to assess deck officers’ NTS.Two sets of Chief Mate volunteer students’ NTS performance was assessed in the bridge simulator. One set of students are those who have not obtained NTS training i.e. HELM (Human Element Leadership and Management) and the other set of students are those who have obtained the HELM training as part of their main course of study. All groups’ NTS performances are calculated by the ER (Evidential Reasoning) Algorithm and are compared to see if there are any improvements in the NTS performance with the HELM training. After comparison it was found that NTS performance of the groups with HELM training was only 0.8% better than the NTS performance of the groups without HELM training.HELM course effectiveness is evaluated and suggestions are given for further improvements to the course. Cost benefit analysis for improving deck officers’ NTS was carried out by Bayesian Network and Decision Tree Model.","A review of maritime accidents conducted in 2006 confirms that human error is the main contributing factor in maritime accidents.

389,2023,PQDT - Global,Enhancing Robustness to Forecast Errors in Availability Control for Airline Revenue Management,"Traditional revenue management systems are built under the assumption of independent demand per fare. The fare transformation theory is a methodology to adjust fares that allows for the continued use of optimization algorithms and seat inventory control methods, even with the shift towards dependent demand. Under a sell-up demand model, this marginal revenue transformation reduces the value of a specific fare by a varying margin, dependent on the upsell probability to higher fare productsSince accurate demand forecasts are a key input to this methodology, it is reasonable to assume that for a scenario with uncertainties and disturbances it may deliver suboptimal performance. Factors such as lack or bad quality of historical booking data, inaccurate demand models, and inherent demand variability contribute to the complexity of forecasting demand in airline revenue management systems. Moreover, airlines faced striking challenges in demand forecasting during and after COVID-19, struggling to adapt to an environment characterized by unstable customer behavior, prominent schedule instability, and continuously shifting travel restrictions.This work demonstrates, firstly, that the fare transformation theory is a theoretical dominant approach under perfect conditions, even under a varying range of input parameters. Secondly, it lacks robustness to forecast errors. A Monte Carlo simulation replicating a revenue management system under mild assumptions indicates that a forecast error of ±20% can potentially prompt a necessity to adjust the margin employed in the fare transformation theory by −10%. This may vary slightly according to other input parameters, such as upsell probability, expected demand, capacity, and fare structure related variables.To capture the relationships between the optimal margin for seat availability control and input parameters, a tree-based machine learning model is employed. This model highlights the forecast error as the predominant factor, with bias playing an even more pivotal role than variance. On the one hand, when bias assumes positive values, meaning that the forecast is overestimating the real demand, the margin from the fare transformation theory needs to be adjusted down. On the other hand, with an escalating variance that signifies a progressively worsening forecast, there is a corresponding need to downwardly adjust the margin.To validate the dominance of the predictive model under imperfect conditions, an out-ofsample study with 100 generated flights is performed for distinct scenarios. For the setting with a forecast error of ±40% and a possible systematic error of ±10%, the predictive model with margin corrections outperforms the fare transformation theory in terms of expected revenue in 0.0144%. For a network carrier with thousands of flights a year, it can be an important differentiator.","Traditional revenue management systems are built under the assumption of independent demand per fare.

390,1994,PQDT - Global,Death-Defying Decisions by Aircraft Pilots: The Development of a Simple Reminder to Avoid the Hypervigilance Trap,"The problem of poor decision-making by aircraft pilots has been clearly identified as a significant contributor to the unacceptably high level of aviation accidents. Extensive research in the United States of America, sponsored by the Federal Aviation Authority, has proved that pilot decisionmaking can be improved through education and training, resulting in reduced accident levels. Various programmes have been developed and are being applied in the U.S.A. and Canada at the abinitio pilot training level. Most international airlines and military aviation authorities have applied this knowledge to their own training programmes, but there appears to be a lack of co-ordinated follow-up, world-wide, for existing general aviation pilots to be exposed to these important developments. This situation exists in South Africa also, but additionally, there is an urgent need to .. introduce the decision-making programmes into ab-initio pilot training. The purpose of this study was to develop an intervention which addresses the problem of exposing existing aircraft pilots to pilot decision-making training.The research method which was followed is the developmental research model of Nel and Nel (1992). The disciplined approach to intervention development in the human sciences which the model demands, ensures that the parameters for the successful development of the intervention are clearly established in advance of its application, so that its validity can be assessed on an acceptable academic basis.The innovative intervention was applied to a sample of 400 pilots taken at random from the Pilot Register of the Department of Transport: Directorate of Civil Aviation. Following the application of the intervention, a follow-up questionnaire was mailed to all recipients, resulting in a satisfactory response level of over 14% versus a targetted response-level of 12Y:z%. The analysis of the results from the questionnaires shows an overwhelming acceptance of the intervention by pilots and there are indications that it has produced positive attitude changes in some individuals. The results clearly indicate the validity of the intervention, with minor modifications, for broadscale application to all South African pilots. The possibility that the concept can be used internationally will also need to be investigated.This study suggests that further research into hazardous attitudes, and whether or not these form part of personality, could be useful in working towards the thus-far-elusive goal of determining whether or not accident-proneness is a trait which can be identified in individuals. If such a measure could be validated it could result in a quantum leap forward in reducing pilot-caused aviation accidents.","The problem of poor decision-making by aircraft pilots has been clearly identified as a significant contributor to the unacceptably high level of aviation accidents.

Of these four cameras, three are inside the car and one of them outside the car. Each camera is focused in one specific and critical part of the driving: the road, the driver, the pedals and the controls (gearshift, steering wheel, wiper controls, etc.).Each one of the camera records a video that is save in one computer placed in the control room, inside the Laboratório de Análise de Tráfego in FEUP. Also, a text file is saved in this computer. This text file contains some information about the driver’s experience, as it can be the car coordinates, the speed of the car, the time, etc.The work of this thesis arises in order to improve the way on how professionals analyse and perform data collected from a DriS driving experience. For that purpose, was created a video-­‐monitorization system, consists in a video application, that allows load and player four videos simultaneously as well as a text file which contains all the data collected from the experience. All of them will be time-coordinated and the user could move forward and backward through them using a slider. Also, as a basic video player, contains some buttons to control the status of the video (play, stop, pause) allowing the professionals analyse with detail the four videos and the data.Take advantage of the new progresses in software development, the application was made in C++ using the Qt library, and its integrated development environment the Qt Creator, which made easier the implementation.At the end of this report (Chapter 4) is attached a user manual in order to explain and help the professionals to use the application.","In the last few years, ISEP in collaboration with FEUP and other universities, created a realistic driving simulator called DriS, which had the objective to help in researches of different areas, as civil engineer, computer graphics, psychology, education, etc.The result of this thesis pretends to help the professionals who analyse the data collected in each driving experience, in order to allow them the study of the driver’s reactions at different obstacles during a ride, at the same time.DriS simulator consists in one white screen where the driving simulators environments are projected, in one real car to make the driving experience and four cameras placed in the car. Of these four cameras, three are inside the car and one of them outside the car. Each camera is focused in one specific and critical part of the driving: the road, the driver, the pedals and the controls (gearshift, steering wheel, wiper controls, etc.).Each one of the camera records a video that is save in one computer placed in the control room, inside the Laboratório de Análise de Tráfego in FEUP.","<title>Video-Monitorization System for a Realistic Driving Simulator</title> <excerpt>In the last few years, ISEP in collaboration with FEUP and other universities, created a realistic driving simulator called DriS, which had the objective to help in researches of different areas, as civil engineer, computer graphics, psychology, education, etc.The result of this thesis pretends to help the professionals who analyse the data collected in each driving experience, in order to allow them the study of the driver’s reactions at different obstacles during a ride, at the same time.DriS simulator consists in one white screen where the driving simulators environments are projected, in one real car to make the driving experience and four cameras placed in the car.

396,2025,Natural Hazards,Exploring couples’ information-seeking behaviors when faced with a rare tornado threat,"This study explores household tornado information-seeking behaviors, with an emphasis on the role of social and household contexts, particularly interactions between couples. Despite extensive research on tornado threats and warnings, limited studies have examined how households seek information in response to tornado warnings, especially in low-risk areas. This issue has become more relevant following the National Weather Service’s shift from county-based to polygon-based warnings. To address this gap, 68 couples from the Seattle metropolitan area—an area with low tornado risk—were recruited for a social experiment involving an escalating tornado scenario, with five levels of threat alerts. The couples were randomly assigned to two groups: 33 couples were separated and assigned to the individual task group, while the remaining 35 couples participated together in the joint task group. This yielded a total of 101 participants (33 individual females, 33 individual males, and 35 couples). The study utilized a web-based program, DynaSearch, to present the scenario and collect data on participants’ interactions with different types of visual and textual information. Results indicated a preference for textual information, such as protective action recommendations, hazards, and storm location, over tornado risk maps. Social context was found to significantly influence information-seeking behaviors, with couples spending more time viewing information together compared to individuals. These findings provide valuable insights into information preferences and the influence of social dynamics on decision-making, particularly in low-risk areas. The study’s results offer guidance for enhancing tornado risk communication strategies, especially for households in low-risk regions.","This study explores household tornado information-seeking behaviors, with an emphasis on the role of social and household contexts, particularly interactions between couples.

397,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Measuring the Effect of Task-Irrelevant Visuals in Augmented Reality,"Augmented reality (AR) allows people to view digital information overlaid on to real-world objects. While the technology is still new, it is currently being used in places such as the military and industrial assembly operations in the form of ocular devices worn on the head over the eyes. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) let people always see AR information in their field of view no matter where their head is positioned. Studies have shown that HMDs displaying information directly related to the immediate task can decreased cognitive workload and increase the speed and accuracy of task performance. However, task-irrelevant information has shown to decrease performance and accuracy of the primary task and also hinder the efficiency of processing the irrelevant information. This has been investigated in industry settings but less so in an everyday consumer context. Thisstudy proposes comparing two types of visual information (text and shapes) in AR displayed on an HMD to answer the following questions: 1) when content is of importance, which visual notification (text or shapes) is processed faster while degrading the performance of the primary task the least? And 2) When presence is of importance, which visual notification (text or shapes) is processed faster while degrading the performance of the primary task the least?","Augmented reality (AR) allows people to view digital information overlaid on to real-world objects.

398,2022,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Organizational Culture and Power in High Risk Teams: A Qualitative Content Analysis of the Commercial Aviation Industry,"Commercial aviation is one of the safest modes of transportation. It is due in part to the creation of Crew Resource Management for cockpit crews in the 1980s and its continuous revisions and modifications. In the 1990s the practice made its way from the cockpit to the cabin and was adapted for flight attendants. Together, the goal of Crew Resource Management is to minimize risk to the flying public. Company culture and power can either support or impede the practice of Crew Resource Management. The purpose of this study is to better understand the group dynamics among pilots and flight attendants, and the factors that affect their ability to work together as a team to minimize risk. 50 reports from the pilot category and 50 from the flight attendant category were randomly selected from years 2015, 2016, and 2017 for a total of 300 incident reports from NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System open access database and evaluated for issues of non- compliance using a qualitative content analysis. The results emerged five themes: Company Contract and Systems Conflicts, Communication Issues, General Training Issues, Management of Irregular Situations, Attitudes: Unprofessional, Apathetic and Toxic. The findings provided rich content that support the strength of organizational culture amongst high risk teams, and how adverse behaviors and attitudes amongst these workgroups affect one another. In all, regardless of company culture and training, there is no substitute for individual decision making in minimizing risk in commercial aviation.

399,2006,PQDT - Global,"Temporal Variations in Vigilance, Working Memory and Arithmetic Abilities During Eight Hours of Acute Sleep Deprivation","Background & Objectives:Current operations require ‘round the clock’ engagement of both air and ground crew with a forced period of wakefulness. Earlier studies conducted during a short time frame, of forced wakefulness, have yielded conflicting results. The present study examined temporal variations in vigilance, working memory and arithmetic abilities across eight hours of acute sleep deprivation during an overnight period of forced wakefulness.Methods:Experiment involved hourly measurement of performance (response accuracy and latency) in the above tasks and recording of EEG (F3, C3, P3, O1, F4, C4, P4 and O2 configuration) in a group of 18 healthy male non smokers (31±3 yr) during the above period of sleep deprivation. Tasks were practiced till performance reached asymptotic levels. An artifact-free epoch of 4 seconds was submitted to FFT for spectral analysis. Total and constituent (δ, θ, α & β) power in frontal (F3 and F4) and parieto-occipital (P3, O1, P4 & O2) regions was analyzed during resting sitting and each of the task conditions. Due to significant departures from normality, a nonparametric (Friedman’s) ANOVA was employed for statistical analysis.Results:No variation in the performance in any of the tasks was seen across the period of study. Total and δ power in the frontal region decreased significantly when the subjects were resting sitting. These changes disappeared during engagement of the subjects in the task. All the task conditions exhibited a significant reduction in β power in the parieto-occipital region. There was no EEG indication of a de-aroused state.Interpretation & Conclusion:EEG changes in the resting sitting could be interpreted as manifestation of an active wakefulness. Change in beta activity during engagement in tasks was a manifestation of information processing. Arousal was maintained due, apparently, to periodic engagement of subjects in mentally demanding activity. Overnight, forced wakefulness was not found to result in degradation in performance of well-learnt and practiced tasks.","Background & Objectives:Current operations require ‘round the clock’ engagement of both air and ground crew with a forced period of wakefulness.

401,1998,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Design and evaluation of faculty development for initiation of student-required Internet use,"The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a faculty development process which would enable faculty to incorporate student use of the Internet into subsequent course curricula. The process designed includes two workshops: Basic Internet Skills Workshop and Internet Impact and Innovation Workshop. The study included 31 faculty participants from a rural state university, representing the following departments and divisions: Art, Biological Sciences, Languages and Literature, Music, Physical Sciences, Social Work, Accounting, Commercial Aviation, Computer Information Systems and Office Administration, Economics and Finance, Management and Marketing, Curriculum and Instruction, Psychology, and Nursing. Data for the study were collected via five instruments: Introduction to Internet Training Competency Check Sheet, Internet In My Life Survey, Internet Innovation Workshop Evaluation, Faculty Internet Innovation, and Student Internet Innovation.Responses were analyzed through descriptive statistics presented by frequency count, percentages, t-tests and correlation for the collected data. The statistical software package Statistics with Finesse was used to analyze the data. Major findings of this study indicate that faculty interested in participating in Internet workshops will be operating at varied skill levels as either Users or Nonusers. Nonusers can significantly increase their skills with minimal effort through participating in the Basic Internet Skills Workshop. Once a minimal skill level is achieved, faculty who participate in the Internet Impact and Innovation Workshop will increase their readiness level for integrating information technology into subsequent courses. Faculty operating at a low to moderate readiness level increased to moderate to high readiness level for integrating information technology into course curricula. Increase in readiness level lead the majority of participants to included student use of information technology into at least one subsequent course.From the findings of this study, it was recommended that pretest and posttest evaluation, along with evaluation of workshop quality be reviewed and applied to revision of the workshops prior to future implementation. It was further recommended that future research be conducted with faculty who are operating at a moderate to high readiness level and compare results with this study to determine workshop appropriateness for a broader set of participants.","The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a faculty development process which would enable faculty to incorporate student use of the Internet into subsequent course curricula.

402,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,'Air-mindedness' and Air Parades: Images of Flight and Aviation and Their Relation to Soviet Identity in Soviet Film 1926-1945,"Taking Soviet films from 1926 to 1945 as its frame of reference, this thesis seeks to answer the question: is autonomous voicing possible in film during a period defined by Stalin's concentration of power and his authoritarian influence on the arts? Aviation and flight imaging in these films shares characteristics of language, and the examination of the use of aviation and flight as an expressive means reveals nuances in messaging which go beyond the official demand of Soviet Socialist Realism to show life in its revolutionary movement towards socialism. Reviewing the films chronologically, it is shown how they are unified by a metaphor of 'gaining wings'. In filmic representations of air-shows, Arctic flights, aviation schools, aviation circus-acts, and aircraft invention, the Soviet peoples' identity in the 1930s became constructed as being metaphorically 'winged'. This metaphor links to the fundamental Icarian precursor myth and, in turn, speaks to sub-structuring semantic spheres of freedom, transformation, creativity, love and transcendence. Air-parade film communicates symbolically, but refers to real events; like an icon, it visualizes the word of Stalinist-Leninist scriptures. Piloted by heroic 'falcons', Soviet destiny was perceived to be a miraculous 'flight' which realised the political and technological dreams of centuries. But aviation and cinematographic flights communicate multi-valently, beyond that of the ideological dominant. Film based on the myth of the 'Russian Icarus' points to the possibility of the Revolution as an Icarian flight perceived as a fall in Stalin's time. Cinematographic flights, both actual and metaphorical, can be communicated on levels of psychology, cinema-philosophy and allegory, and 'gaining wings' is a universal metaphor for self-expansion in love, creative work and gaining knowledge. The expressive use of flight and aviation may have been directed towards the communication of a 'bright' socialist future, but this thesis shows its communication of Soviet identity is more complex.","Taking Soviet films from 1926 to 1945 as its frame of reference, this thesis seeks to answer the question: is autonomous voicing possible in film during a period defined by Stalin's concentration of power and his authoritarian influence on the arts?

Our method builds on the recent finding that covert visual attention affects the pupillary light response: Your pupil constricts when you covertly (without looking at it) attend to a bright, compared to a dark, stimulus. In our method, participants covertly attend to one of several letters with oscillating brightness. Pupil size reflects the brightness of the selected letter, which allows us–with high accuracy and in real time–to determine which letter the participant intends to select. The performance of our method is comparable to the best covert-attention brain-computer interfaces to date, and has several advantages: no movement other than pupil-size change is required; no physical contact is required (i.e. no electrodes); it is easy to use; and it is reliable. Potential applications include: communication with totally locked-in patients, training of sustained attention, and ultra-secure password input.","We present a new human-computer interface that is based on decoding of attention through pupillometry.

There is an increasing interest in studying the influence of emotions and its role as psychosocial factors in the work environment as they are able to act as facilitators or shock absorbers. The contrast of the theoretical models by using traditional parametric techniques requires a large sample size to the efficient estimation of the coefficients that quantify the relations between variables. Since the available sample that we have is small, the most common size in European enterprises, we used the maximum entropy principle to explore the emotions that are involved in the psychosocial risks. The analyses show that this method takes advantage of the limited information available and guarantee an optimal estimation, the results of which are coherent with theoretical models and numerous empirical researches about emotions and well-being.","This paper explores and analyzes the relations between emotions and well-being in a sample of aviation personnel, passenger crew (flight attendants).

407,2013,PLoS One,Virtual Superheroes: Using Superpowers in Virtual Reality to Encourage Prosocial Behavior,"Background Recent studies have shown that playing prosocial video games leads to greater subsequent prosocial behavior in the real world. However, immersive virtual reality allows people to occupy avatars that are different from them in a perceptually realistic manner. We examine how occupying an avatar with the superhero ability to fly increases helping behavior.Principal Findings Using a two-by-two design, participants were either given the power of flight (their arm movements were tracked to control their flight akin to Superman’s flying ability) or rode as a passenger in a helicopter, and were assigned one of two tasks, either to help find a missing diabetic child in need of insulin or to tour a virtual city. Participants in the “super-flight” conditions helped the experimenter pick up spilled pens after their virtual experience significantly more than those who were virtual passengers in a helicopter.Conclusion The results indicate that having the “superpower” of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman). This research illustrates the potential of using experiences in virtual reality technology to increase prosocial behavior in the physical world.","Background Recent studies have shown that playing prosocial video games leads to greater subsequent prosocial behavior in the real world.

408,2021,Aerospace,Aircraft Assembly Snags: Human Errors or Lack of Production Design?,"To err is an intrinsic human trait, which means that human errors, at some point, are inevitable. Business improvement tools and practices neglect to deal with the root causes of human error; hence, they ignore certain design considerations that could possibly prevent or minimise such errors from occurring. Recognising this gap, this paper seeks to conceptualise a model that incorporates cognitive science literature based on a mistake-proofing concept, thereby offering a deeper, more profound level of human error analysis. An exploratory case study involving an aerospace assembly line was conducted to gain insights into the model developed. The findings of the case study revealed four different causes of human errors, as follows: (i) description similarity error, (ii) capture errors, (iii) memory lapse errors, and (iv) interruptions. Based on this analysis, error-proofing measures have been proposed accordingly. This paper lays the foundation for future work on the psychology behind human errors in the aerospace industry and highlights the importance of understanding human errors to avoid quality issues and rework in production settings, where labour input is of paramount importance.","To err is an intrinsic human trait, which means that human errors, at some point, are inevitable.

409,2023,Management Dynamics,International flight attendants' perceptions of service delivery in a physically restricted service environment,"International flight attendants are frontline employees who serve and take care of passengers on commercial airline flights. They do so in a unique service delivery environment compared with other service providers, which presents several difficulties and even barriers to effective service delivery. In this study, the service delivery (which consisted of service-delivery performance and servicerecovery performance) of international flight attendants was investigated. A theoretical model was proposed to illustrate the unique factors that might influence their service-delivery and service-recovery performance. Data were collected using an online questionnaire that was completed by 228 international flight attendants globally. The results indicated that their working conditions and demanding passengers led to fatigue. However, fatigue did not directly curtail their service-delivery performance. Supervisory support improved teamwork, which influenced service-delivery performance directly and service-recovery performance indirectly. Work experience enhanced teamwork directly and both servicedelivery performance and service-recovery performance indirectly. Given that the management of international airlines cannot change the physical environment in which flight attendants deliver their in-flight services, this study highlights several strategies that could be used to manage onboard staff to overcome the barriers to effective service delivery. Doing so should enhance customer satisfaction, cost savings, and employee well-being - all of which would benefit airlines in the long term.","International flight attendants are frontline employees who serve and take care of passengers on commercial airline flights.

410,2004,PQDT - UK & Ireland,Virtual suturing for training in vascular surgery,"Today's health professionals are facing a crisis in training needs: on one hand, the working hours of junior doctors and experience at the operating table are being reduced; on the other, patients are growing ever more critical and litigious. VR simulators may be able to provide a solution, but whilst hardware costs have fallen in recent years, they are still expensive when compared to conventional methods and few have been adopted. The challenge for researchers has been to create realistic, but affordable, surgical interfaces and to provide convincing assessments of the resulting systems. There are several common forms of assessment in the surgical simulation literature. The most popular would seem to be the construct validity test, in which experts' performance is contrasted with that of novices. Although this method provides a useful check, it is argued that the results are often unreliable, given the short-term nature of the test and the difficulty of separating practice and learning effects. Moreover, a wider literature search shows that consistency and persistency of performance are much more highly respected in eg. military and aviation contexts. A design for a virtual suturing simulator, dubbed FESTIVALS, is proposed which is based upon principles established in motor psychology over the last few decades. In particular, practice variability is promoted by requiring the user to employ both hands in facilitating access. Also, a delayed feedback schedule is introduced to provide feedback on errors. The Finite Element Method is adapted to build an accurate deformation model to support bimanual working and real-time haptic display. Evaluation of this system showed that the FESTIVALS system possessed good training and retention characteristics. In addition, a usability study collected feedback from clinicians which showed a generally favourable response and allowed several recommendations for future development. By considering discrete phases of the suturing data collected in these evaluations, it is also possible to show that construct validity held for several metrics. This is of particular interest because it appears to show that experts were much more capable of planning specific movements in advance, suggesting a more highly developed technique for error-control. This finding led to a novel proposal for an error-correction model of expertise.","Today's health professionals are facing a crisis in training needs: on one hand, the working hours of junior doctors and experience at the operating table are being reduced; on the other, patients are growing ever more critical and litigious.

411,2017,European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies,The Emerging Safety Mindfulness Model: From Concept Definition Into Requirements Collection,"Advanced by Weick and Sutcliffe at the end of the 90ies, 'collective mindfulness' enables an organisation to cope with unpleasant surprises by having the collective mindset necessary to detect, understand and recover them before they bring about bad consequences. Although Weick's ideas on mindfulness are popular, they have proven difficult to implement. This is possibly because they have remained 'ideas' and principles rather than concrete proposals on how to support or even engineer better mindfulness into organisations. To overcome this gap, a novel 'safety mindfulness' model has been advanced to able to identify solutions to organizational safety across the whole organization in normal and non-normal operations. This paper illustrates the methodological approach that has been used to specify the model. The multiple case study design was used to produce detailed descriptions of the mindfulness phenomenon using theoretical statements and research questions to guide the collection and analysis of data in each case study. Further, it provided the background approach used to ensuring validity and reliability of the findings. Qualitative Content Analysis was used to support the design and application of a systematic process from the research design into the replication of results (i.e. relying on replication logic to provide external validation to the findings). The use of multiple sources of evidence supported data triangulation and consistency of results. Data recording and analysis was supported by NVivo (© QSR International). The case studies were applied in two distinctive organizations from the aviation domain - i.e. an Italian airline company and an ATC (Air Traffic Control) company based in The Netherlands. The case studies followed the same protocol for data collection, but tested two different implementation approaches. The user and functional requirements served to specify the underlying functionalities of the novel model. The model is expected to bring a positive impact on how the organization as a whole can mobilise its resources to identify, understand and respond effectively and adaptively to potential threats embedded in its operations and operational environment, influencing both how people approach their operational responsibilities and how the organization can reflect on, improve and change its systems.","Advanced by Weick and Sutcliffe at the end of the 90ies, 'collective mindfulness' enables an organisation to cope with unpleasant surprises by having the collective mindset necessary to detect, understand and recover them before they bring about bad consequences.

412,2018,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Out of the Loop, in Your Bubble: Mind Wandering Is Independent From Automation Reliability, but Influences Task Engagement","This study examined the influence of automation reliability on task-unrelated mind wandering frequency and the impact of mind wandering on task engagement. Automated environment features make it particularly prone to increase mind wandering frequency. Through mechanisms like complacency or agency, automating a task could increase mind wandering frequency for the operator. For safety-critical industries, the lower perception and degraded stimuli processing associated with mind wandering, summarized by the term “decoupling hypothesis”, are particularly concerning. 16 participants supervised an autopilot avoiding obstacles with two levels of reliability. Each condition lasted 45 minutes. We recorded thoughts as either pertaining to being focused, task-related mind wandering or task-unrelated mind wandering. We also recorded perceived mental demand, trust regarding the autopilot and oculometric measures. Based on questionnaire results, our protocol succeeded in inducing more mental demand and lower trust when the automation was unreliable. Attentional states were not correlated, nor did it influence trust in the system reliability. On the contrary, mental demand ratings and pupil diameter were lower during both task-related and task-unrelated mind wandering, compared to those during the focus attentional state. This shows that perceptual decoupling also affects the engagement of operators in automated environments, which may dramatically lower their ability to supervise automation efficiently. This research informs human-automation designers to consider operator engagement when creating automated systems.","This study examined the influence of automation reliability on task-unrelated mind wandering frequency and the impact of mind wandering on task engagement.

A typological and cross-cultural approach,"Objective: The goal of this study is to uncover latent classes of maternal and paternal helicopter parenting among American and Chinese college students, and to examine whether latent classes of maternal and paternal helicopter parenting are related to college students' mental health (depression and self-esteem). Background: Previous studies have examined the association between helicopter parenting and college students' well-being. However, less is known about how the multidimensional construct of helicopter parenting is related to college students' mental health across Western and Eastern cultural contexts. Method: We conducted three-step latent class analyses using nine helicopter parenting indicators for 1,386 mother-child and 1,214 father-child groups in the United States and 520 mother-child and 454 father-child groups in China. Next, we tested the association between the class membership of maternal and paternal helicopter parenting and college students' mental health. Results: We identified distinct helicopter parenting latent classes among four American and Chinese parent-child groups. We also found that American college students in the strong maternal helicopter parenting latent class reported poorer mental health than those in other latent classes. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the multi-dimensional construct of helicopter parenting can be interpreted differently by parents and college-aged children according to their social and cultural contexts. Implications: The findings of this study suggest that it is necessary to strengthen understanding of the multi-dimensional construct of helicopter parenting for parents with college-aged children to enable them to develop more appropriate parenting practices as well as support their children's well-being.","Objective: The goal of this study is to uncover latent classes of maternal and paternal helicopter parenting among American and Chinese college students, and to examine whether latent classes of maternal and paternal helicopter parenting are related to college students' mental health (depression and self-esteem).

416,2007,Psychological Research,Fixed versus dynamic orientations in environmental learning from ground-level and aerial perspectives,"Ground-level and aerial perspectives in virtual space provide simplified conditions for investigating differences between exploratory navigation and map reading in large-scale environmental learning. General similarities and differences in ground-level and aerial encoding have been identified, but little is known about the specific characteristics that differentiate them. One such characteristic is the need to process orientation; ground-level encoding (and navigation) typically requires dynamic orientations, whereas aerial encoding (and map reading) is typically conducted in a fixed orientation. The present study investigated how this factor affected spatial processing by comparing ground-level and aerial encoding to a hybrid condition: aerial-with-turns. Experiment 1 demonstrated that scene recognition was sensitive to both perspective (ground-level or aerial) and orientation (dynamic or fixed). Experiment 2 investigated brain activation during encoding, revealing regions that were preferentially activated perspective as in previous studies (Shelton and Gabrieli in J Neurosci 22:2711-2717, 2002), but also identifying regions that were preferentially activated as a function of the presence or absence of turns. Together, these results differentiated the behavioral and brain consequences attributable to changes in orientation from those attributable to other characteristics of ground-level and aerial perspectives, providing leverage on how orientation information is processed in everyday spatial learning.","Ground-level and aerial perspectives in virtual space provide simplified conditions for investigating differences between exploratory navigation and map reading in large-scale environmental learning.

The results show that the Attention to Detail score is a linear predictor of threat detection accuracy. We then develop and fine-tune a novel self-report scale for security screening: the XRIndex, which improves on the Attention to Detail scale for predictive power and opacity to interpretation. The XRIndex is not redundant with any of the Big Five personality traits. We validate the XRIndex against security x-ray images with an independent sample of untrained participants and suggest that the XRIndex may be a useful aid for the identification of suitable candidates for professional security training with a focus on x-ray threat detection.

However, it is unclear how these parenting styles affect the developmental outcomes and trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and how children’s internal inhibitory control (IC) moderates such effects. The present study aimed to examine this issue. A sample of 172 typically developing children (77 girls; Mage = 7.14, SDage = 0.33) and their parents participated in the study. Parents reported children’s anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist each year from the first measurement (T1) to the third measurement (T3) and reported their helicopter parenting and tiger parenting at T1. Children completed the Go/No-go task at T1 to measure their IC. Higher T1 helicopter parenting impeded the declines in anxiety and depression over time, and higher T1 tiger parenting predicted more anxiety and depressive symptoms at T3. However, such effects were only observed in children with low IC, and higher IC buffered the adverse impacts of both helicopter parenting and tiger parenting on children’s anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings revealed that helicopter parenting and tiger parenting had negative impacts on the developmental trajectories and outcomes of anxiety and depression in children and suggest that IC plays an important role in alleviating the risks of anxiety and depression among children in adverse environments.","Helicopter parenting and tiger parenting may increase the risks of anxiety and depression in children.

420,2025,"Cognition, Technology & Work",Intelligent automated systems to support human teamwork: perceived invasiveness impacts team members’ psychological reactions negatively,"Technological advances facilitate intelligent automated systems that are designed to help teams improve teamwork processes, e.g., communication in medical teams or simulated team training in aviation. To provide feedback, such systems constantly collect data, which can lead to privacy or security concerns of employees. Consequently, teams might perceive such systems as psychologically invasive, i.e., their privacy to be intruded. Previous work acknowledged that it is important to design unobtrusive systems, but empirical evidence on conditions under which teams accept electronic monitoring for teamwork support is missing. This work investigates psychological reactions to electronic team monitoring (ETM), i.e., automated systems that aim to support human teamwork. In study one, N = 156 participants watched one of three video vignettes in an experimental between-subject design. The vignettes presented ETM with varying levels of invasiveness. High invasiveness related to perceived unfairness, stress and lower acceptance. In study two, between-subject differences in reactions to ETM were investigated in a virtual team task with ad-hoc teams. N = 20 participants worked on a team task and were made believe that they are monitored for two different purposes (low invasive system for team support vs. high invasive system for performance appraisal). Teams did not differ regarding perceived acceptance or stress and both systems were rated as equally invasive. Teams questioned the validity of both ETM for supporting teamwork processes. The results of the studies demonstrate that invasiveness is decisive for teams’ reaction to ETM. To avoid team members’ resistance, the perceived invasiveness should be considered as a salient feature that might negate intended positive effects.","Technological advances facilitate intelligent automated systems that are designed to help teams improve teamwork processes, eg, communication in medical teams or simulated team training in aviation.

One view is that humans are a problem to control. Humans were seen as the cause of safety trouble. These negative characteristics could be identified by testing and screening employees. Technological developments were so rapid and complex that no amount of intervention addressing the human worker alone could solve safety problems. Hence, the question is whether the solution lies in greater bureaucratization, and in seeing people as a problem to control. Continuing to see people as a problem to control through protocol and compliance may deliver more of the same, and not much progress. The most useful prescription is to strike a balance between bureaucratically controlled safety and worker-managed safety (Amalberti, 2013), or between deference to protocol and procedure on the one hand, and practical expertise on the other (Galison, 2000).","Throughout the 20th century, people have been of two minds about the role of humans in creating and breaking safety; perhaps they still are.

This study examined adolescents’ and mothers’ perceptions of helicopter parenting, and whether (dis)agreements between these views were associated with perceived conflict and support. Participants were 349 late adolescents (MT1age = 18.20; 39.8% male) and their mothers (MT1age = 49.10) in Hong Kong who completed four assessments over one year. Results suggested that youth-mother agreements regarding helicopter parenting were positively associated with both conflict and support. Additionally, discrepancies between their reports were positively related to adolescent-reported conflict. These findings highlight the importance of examining multiple perspectives when studying helicopter parenting dynamics, and suggest both positive and negative aspects of these practices in Chinese families.","Adolescents’ and parents’ similar and/or divergent perceptions of parental behaviors may be associated with youth-parent relationship quality.

To determine whether global, regional, and psychological health-related outcomes differ between individuals with and without CAI. Case-control study. Laboratory. Twenty-five participants with CAI (age = 21.9 ± 2.5 years, height = 170.8 ± 8.6 cm, mass = 69.8.0 ± 11.7 kg) were sex- and limb-matched to 25 healthy participants (age = 22.0 ± 2.1 years, height = 167.4 ± 9.1 cm, mass = 64.8 ± 11.2 kg). Both groups completed the Disablement in the Physically Active Scale, the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), the FAAM-Sport, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11, and the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire. Dependent variables were scores on these instruments, and the independent variable was group. Compared with healthy individuals, those with CAI reported decreased function on the Disablement in the Physically Active Scale, FAAM, and FAAM-Sport (P < .001) and increased fear of reinjury on the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11 and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (P < .001). In the CAI group, the FAAM and FAAM-Sport demonstrated a significant relationship (r = 0.774, P < .01). Individuals with CAI reported decreased function and increased fear of reinjury compared with healthy control participants. Also, within the CAI group, there was a strong relationship between FAAM and FAAM-Sport scores but not between any other instruments. These findings suggest that health-related quality of life should be examined during the rehabilitation process of individuals with CAI.","Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) have reported decreased global and regional function.

Using cluster sampling, 251 pilots’ self-efficacy, special flight situation handling capability, resilience and perseverance were assessed using standardized scales. Pilots with high self-efficacy can improve their resilience to enhance their capability to handle special situations. An analysis was performed that included perseverance in the mediation model, and results showed that the influence of self-efficacy on special situation handling through resilience was moderated by perseverance. The relations between self-efficacy and special flight situation handling capability present a moderated mediation model. A pilot’s capability of handling special situations, ensuring flight safety and combat capability may be enhanced by improving their self-efficacy, resilience, and perseverance.","This study aimed to explore the mediating and moderating effects of resilience and perseverance on pilots’ self-efficacy and capability of handling special situations.

430,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Crystallized and Fluid Cognitive Predictors of Military Pilot Training Scores and Completion,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the subdomains of cognitive ability as predictors of military pilot training outcomes. The key concepts that were investigated included subdomains of crystallized and fluid cognitive ability frequently used for employee selection including verbal ability, numerical ability, working memory, perceptual speed, reaction time, and spatial ability. The outcome variables included pilot training performance indicators (i.e., overall training scores and completion/attrition) from a sample of military pilot trainees (N = 5,832) across the two phases of undergraduate pilot training within the U.S. Air Force: primary flight instruction and advanced flight instruction. Questions explored within the study included evaluating which subdomains of cognitive ability are most predictive of, or provide incremental validity in the prediction of pilot training outcomes across the two phases of military pilot training. The target population included U.S. Air Force pilot trainees who quit, failed, or completed either phase of pilot training. The primary research questions were fully answered. Through a series of correlational and regression analyses, the research showed that all nine cognitive subdimensions measured in the study were significantly related (p < .05) to pilot training outcomes at the primary phase of pilot training and eight of the nine subdimensions were significantly related to pilot training outcomes at the advanced phase of training. The results of multiple linear regression analyses using stepwise selection revealed that verbal comprehension, arithmetic ability, memory, spatial ability, and reaction time provided the most salient combination to predict training performance in the primary phase of training [F(5, 5388) = 53.34, p < .0001)]. In addition, verbal comprehension, arithmetic ability, spatial ability, perceptual speed/accuracy, and reaction time provided the most salient combination to predict training performance in the advanced bomber/fighter phase of training [F(5, 1554) = 14.62, p < .0001)]. In the advanced airlift tanker phase of training, verbal comprehension, similarities, vocabulary, arithmetic ability, spatial ability, perceptual speed/accuracy, and memory provided the most salient combination to predict training performance [F(7, 3031) = 19.10, p < .0001)]. To avoid range restriction in the predictor variables, future research should include samples of pilot trainee applicants rather than fully vetted and selected trainees. Practitioners in industrial/organizational and aviation psychology can use the results to guide decisions regarding the subdimensions of cognitive ability to be included in test batteries for pilot trainee selection.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the subdomains of cognitive ability as predictors of military pilot training outcomes.

Seventy-seven students were randomized to either a non-technical skills seminar (NTS group, n=43) or a medical seminar (control group, n=34). The human patient simulation was used as an evaluation tool. Before the seminars, all students performed the same simulated emergency scenario to provide baseline measurements. After the seminars, all students were exposed to a second scenario, and behavioural markers for evaluating their nontechnical skills were rated. Furthermore, teamwork-relevant attitudes were measured before and after the scenarios, and perceived stress was measured following each simulation. All simulations were also evaluated for various medical endpoints. Non-technical skills concerning situation awareness (p<.01, r=0.5) and teamwork (p<.01, r=0.45) improved from simulation I to II in the NTS group. Decision making improved in both groups (NTS: p<.01, r=0.39; control: p<.01, r=0.46). The attitude ?handling errors? improved significantly in the NTS group (p<.05, r=0.34). Perceived stress decreased from simulation I to II in both groups. Medical endpoints and patients' outcome did not differ significantly between the groups in simulation II. This study highlights the effectiveness of a single brief seminar on non-technical skills to improve student?s non-technical skills. In a next step, to improve student?s handling of emergencies and patient outcomes, non-technical skills seminars should be accompanied by exercises and more broadly embedded in the medical school curriculum.","The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a tailor-made, non-technical skills seminar on medical student?s behaviour, attitudes, and performance during simulated patient treatment.

437,2018,PQDT - Global,Online Detection of Pilot Workload by Using fNIR Sensors,"Measuring mental workload of pilots and evaluating such measurements are important concerns in the aviation domain that requires high safety critical precautions. However, obtaining valid online measures without reducing operational capabilities of pilots remains to be an active area of research in human factors and aviation psychology. The aim of this thesis is to develop online measures for monitoring the changes of pilots’ mental workload and establish a basis for follow-up studies that may use these measurements to implement new types of safety precautions in the cockpit. Since Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology has been successfully employed in recent human factors studies and fNIRS sensors have an ergonomic design that minimizes the discomfort of pilots as compared to other brain imaging methods, fNIRS optical brain imaging technology is employed in this thesis study. Firstly, changes in the mental workload of pilots are studied as performing offline analyses in well-defined test scenarios in order to devise physiological patterns and algorithms for mental workload assessment. Afterwards, a software that can make online mental workload assessment by using these algorithms is developed and tested. The results indicate that models that are trained over data sampled from all pilots’ sessions yielded the highest classification accuracy. SVM with RBF kernel function, LSTM and RNN which are used during the model development yield the highest accuracy scores with the given order, albeit with similar results.","Measuring mental workload of pilots and evaluating such measurements are important concerns in the aviation domain that requires high safety critical precautions.

438,2005,PQDT - Global,Developing an Aviation Safety Strategy Within the Southern African Context: A Stakeholder Perspective,"Certain new realities, such as the liberalisation of the skies and increased air traffic in South Africa are bound to test the existing safety strategies, regulations and maintenance of standards.In order to obtain a picture of the future architecture and the standard of aviation safety in South Africa, the mental models of stakeholders in the industry were investigated in a qualitative, study. A qualitative interpretive research design was followed. The research question was: What are the mental models of key stakeholders in the aviation safety environment and how does this need to be accounted for in the development of an aviation safety strategy, in a Southern African context?In order to obtain a broad spectrum of the social constructs of key stakeholders with regard to aviation safety and to enhance the trustworthiness of the information, three research interventions or information gathering processes were applied. These were the individual interviews through Kelly’s Repertory Grid (Rep Grid) technique, outcomes analysis of the job of a safety manager through a focus group process and a scenario development process (in this sequence). Data was then considered in relation to certain theoretical perspectives, as well as realities in the aviation safety environment in Southern Africa.The study identified pertinent gaps between the mental models elicited from research participants during individual interventions and those elicited during group interventions, as well as a disparity between their mental models and the demands of the aviation safety environment in Southern Africa and the international community. The participants’ individual mental models (or theories in use) focused more on micro systems and symptoms of “unsafety” than the broader systemic relationships and problems. Tendencies towards silo-thinking and single loop learning were indicated.In contrast with the individual mental models, the collective or shared mental models of the participants, elicited during group interventions, represented a more systemic view and a more effective or desired model with regard to aviation safety. The broader system together with its interrelated elements, entropy and unpredictability, as well as critical elements that need to be accounted for in an aviation strategy, were identified. These were, amongst others, effective coordinated regulation and safety oversight on national and regional level; risk management; international recognition; legitimacy; authorisation and market access for airlines; maintenance of standards; international cooperation; and training. It also became clear that safety cannot be understood and managed by focussing on Newtonian laws without a proper appreciation of human factors.Other important perspectives that were identified are the need for the establishment of a study-field for aviation psychology and effective human factors training; as well as the need for a regional regulatory function in Southern Africa.","Certain new realities, such as the liberalisation of the skies and increased air traffic in South Africa are bound to test the existing safety strategies, regulations and maintenance of standards.In order to obtain a picture of the future architecture and the standard of aviation safety in South Africa, the mental models of stakeholders in the industry were investigated in a qualitative, study.

439,2000,Journal of Managerial Psychology,Leadership and job satisfaction among aviation fire fighters in Australia,"Recently important changes have been made to fire service management practices in Australia; however, these changes have typically not been based on empirical research or followed up by systematic evaluation. While job satisfaction and leadership behavior have been extensively investigated in other fields, studies of these variables in the fire service, particularly in Australia, are almost absent. This article examines links between job satisfaction and leadership behavior in aviation fire fighters. Fifty-six fire fighters responded to the Job Descriptive Index and the Leadership Behavior Questionnaire XII. As hypothesized, employee job satisfaction correlated with supervisor leadership behavior, with the exception of consideration leadership and co-worker satisfaction. A new explanation, concerning level of team interaction, is proposed for the findings. Implications for the fire service and areas for further research are suggested.","Recently important changes have been made to fire service management practices in Australia; however, these changes have typically not been based on empirical research or followed up by systematic evaluation.

440,2019,BMC Medical Education,Assessing core competences of medical students with a test for flight school applicants,"Background Important competences of physicians regarding patient safety include communication, leadership, stress resistance, adherence to procedures, awareness, and teamwork. Similarly, while selected, prospective flight school applicants are tested for the same set of skills. The aim of our study was to assess these core competences in advanced undergraduate medical students from different medical schools.Methods In 2017, 67 medical students (year 5 and 6) from the universities of Hamburg, Oldenburg, and TU Munich, Germany, participated in the verified Group Assessment Performance (GAP)-Test at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Hamburg. All participants were rated by DLR assessment observers with a set of empirically derived behavioural checklists. This lists consisted of 6-point rating scales (1: very low occurrence to 6: very high occurrence) and included the competences leadership, teamwork, stress resistance, communication, awareness, and adherence to procedures. Medical students’ scores were compared with the results of 117 admitted flight school applicants.Results Medical students showed significantly higher scores than admitted flight school applicants for adherence to procedures (p< .001, d = .63) and communication (p< .01, d = .62). They reached significantly lower ratings for teamwork (p< .001, d = .77), stress resistance (p< 0.001, d = .70), and awareness (p< .001, d = 1.31). Students in semester 10 showed significantly (p< .02, d = .58) higher scores in domain awareness compared to the final year students. On average, flight school entrance level was not reached by either group for this domain.Conclusions Advanced medical students’ low results for awareness are alarming as awareness is essential and integrative for clinical reasoning and patient safety. Further studies should elucidate and discuss whether awareness needs to be included in medical student selection or integrated into the curriculum in training units.","Background Important competences of physicians regarding patient safety include communication, leadership, stress resistance, adherence to procedures, awareness, and teamwork.

441,2023,BMC Nursing,Development and psychometric properties of a friendly dietary function assessment scale for home-dwelling people with dementia,"BackgroundMealtime difficulties related to cognitive functioning negatively impact a patient’s life during the various stages of dementia, and they typically cause a burden and stress on family caregivers. Most people with dementia live at home alone or are cared for by informal caregivers, typically their spouses or other family members. However, no suitable screening tools for home-dwelling patients with dementia have been developed, nor have measurements focused on executive and self-eating functions. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dietary Function Assessment Scale (DFAS) for community-dwelling persons with dementia.MethodsA mixed-method design was used to develop the instrument. Methods included a comprehensive literature review to identify the item pool and an expert panel to assess the initial item pool. We performed convenience sampling of 190 home-dwelling people with dementia for psychometrical evaluation. The psychometric properties tests included item and factor analyses, criterion-related validity testing, internal consistency reliability testing, and defining the optimal cut-off values. The study was conducted from 2018 to 2019.ResultsItems were generated based on an extensive literature review and pre-existing scales related to mealtime and executive functions in persons with dementia. The S-CVI/Ave of the DFAS was 0.89. A Principal Component factor analysis demonstrated seven items, with a two-factor structure accounting for 56.94% of the total variance. The two extracted factors were Self-eating ability and Dietary executive function. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good model fit. The criterion-related validity was adequate (r = -0.528, p < 0.01). The reliability of Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency was 0.74, and McDonald’s Omega coefficient was 0.80; the optimal cut-off value of 13 points with an AUC of 0.74 was established to determine poor dietary functioning in persons with dementia.ConclusionThe DFAS was simple, user-friendly, and a valid and reliable instrument to assess dietary functioning in community-dwelling persons with dementia. This short scale can be helpful for caretakers, who can use it to identify the dietary needs of home-dwelling persons with dementia and improve their care and eating experience.","BackgroundMealtime difficulties related to cognitive functioning negatively impact a patient’s life during the various stages of dementia, and they typically cause a burden and stress on family caregivers.

443,2017,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"The Costs of Switching Between Team and Multiteam Tasks, and The Role of Shared Cognition","Many individuals work in teams. Many teams are interdependent with other teams. This requires that individuals engage in a specific form of multitasking to contribute to both their team and to other interdependent teams. This thesis extends research on task switching to examine the switch costs that accrue when individuals switch between tasks that vary in their interdependence. This study examined the degree to which having mental models that are more similar to ones teammates reduces the switch cost associated with moving between more and less interdependent work. This idea was tested in a laboratory experiment including 52 college students assigned to work in one of 19 teams. Each team was paired with another team to complete both “team” and “mutliteam” decision-making tasks. Mental models were measured using pairwise comparisons, and switch costs were calculated using the time it took to switch tasks. Findings reveal the more similar an individuals’ mental model to their teammates, the quicker the individual is able to switch between tasks with different levels of interdependence (team to multiteam or multiteam to team). No difference was found in the switch cost associated with transitioning up in interdependence (team to multiteam) or down in interdependence (multiteam to team). These findings have implications for how individuals are able to manage working in teams embedded in complex systems, and how team level cognitive processes facilitate task switching in those contexts.",Many individuals work in teams.

The sample composed of employees (  N  = 240) employed at an international aviation organisation, which operates in Cape Town, Brno and Istanbul. The participants were drawn using convenience sampling. Data were analysed using the Pearson correlation and multiple regression techniques.Main findings: High levels of reliability were found for the scales used in this study. Significant correlations were found among POS, organisational commitment and turnover intention. A linear regression analysis indicated that both organisational commitment and POS are significant predictors of turnover intention.Practical/managerial implications: The findings of this study suggest that POS and commitment play a significant role in reducing turnover intention. Employee support programmes should be offered as a panacea for turnover intention given the need for employee retention and commitment in this industry.Contribution/value-add: The aviation industry strives to retain employees, by investing in employees’ training and development. The contribution of the study can ensure passenger safety and avoid aircraft disasters.

We randomly divided the learners into three groups who studied the same topic: one group studied with the educational software only, the second with the educational software together with an instructor, and the third with an instructor who used a presentation. The learners took a test and four months later they took another test to examine the effectiveness of the instruction over time. The research results show that the recall levels and performance levels on the tests were almost identical in all groups, but in the categories of understanding and applying the addition of an instructor strongly contributed to achievements: Those who received instruction via educational software achieved the best results in the understanding category, while those who studied with an instructor who used a presentation achieved the best results on the test with regard to application of the studied material. The findings of this study can illuminate the effectiveness of using educational software in learning processes in all educational systems.","This study addresses the effectiveness of learning via educational software.

However, very few studies have directly examined this memory aid hypothesis. By systematically manipulating how information is available externally versus internally in a sequential number comparison task, three experiments were designed to investigate the relation between external representations and working memory. The experimental results show that when the task requires information from both external representations and working memory, it is the interaction of information from the two sources that determines task performance. In particular, when information from the two sources does not match well, external representations hinder instead of enhance task performance. The study highlights the important role the coordination among different representations plays in distributed cognition. The general relations between external representations and working memory are discussed.","It is commonly hypothesized that external representations serve as memory aids and improve task performance by means of expanding the limited capacity of working memory.

447,2023,Cognitive Research,Examining post-error performance in a complex multitasking environment,"Previous work on indices of error-monitoring strongly supports that errors are distracting and can deplete attentional resources. In this study, we use an ecologically valid multitasking paradigm to test post-error behavior. It was predicted that after failing an initial task, a subject re-presented with that task in conflict with another competing simultaneous task, would more likely miss their response opportunity for the competing task and stay ‘tunneled’ on the initially errored task. Additionally, we predicted that an error’s effect on attention would dissipate after several seconds, making error cascades less likely when subsequent conflict tasks are delayed. A multi-attribute task battery was used to present tasks and collect measures of both post-error and post-correct performance. Results supported both predictions: post-error accuracy on the competing task was lower compared to post-correct accuracy, and error-proportions were higher at shorter delays, dissipating over time. An exploratory analysis also demonstrated that following errors (as opposed to post-correct trials), participants clicked more on the task panel of the initial error regardless of delay; this continued task-engagement provides preliminary support for errors leading to a cognitive tunneling effect.","Previous work on indices of error-monitoring strongly supports that errors are distracting and can deplete attentional resources.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity of repeated performance testing during spaceflight. Four National Aeronautics and Space Administration crewmembers were trained to complete computerized questionnaires and performance tasks at repeated regular intervals before and after a 10-day shuttle mission and at times that interfered minimally with other mission activities during spaceflight. Two types of performance, Digit-Symbol Substitution trial completion rates and response times during the most complex Number Recognition trials, were altered slightly during spaceflight. All other dimensions of the performance tasks remained essentially unchanged over the course of the study. Verbal ratings of Fatigue increased slightly during spaceflight and decreased during the postflight test sessions. Arousal ratings increased during spaceflight and decreased postflight. No other consistent changes in rating-scale measures were observed over the course of the study. Crewmembers completed all mission requirements in an efficient manner with no indication of clinically significant behavioral impairment during the 10-day spaceflight.

The study is performed in compliance with medical psychology, together with the study of combat stress phenomenology and the development of psychological tools for psychodiagnostics, psychocorrection, and psychotherapy. The author presents express-methods that allow both to establish the signs of combat stress and to assess it in points, to work with tools in the field at any weather and season or hospital conditions. The suggested comprehensive approach to the study of the combat stress phenomenon among the specialists through its understanding of the integrative internal content where one of its elements is psychological resources. This approach allows us to study combat stress in the dynamics of its changes, as a state of mental stress among the servicemen during their adaptation to combat conditions using the resource potential. The analysis showed that the proposed methods are universal and allow a comprehensive consideration of the combat stress problem among the servicemen.","The article is dedicated to the analysis of psychological techniques used in psychological practice to determine the combat stress among aviation professionals.

The author introduces strategies that can be utilized by commercial pilots to handle stressful events in the often-challenging flight environment and establishes a foundation for further empirical research in the area of human stress control in aviation settings. Stress management techniques adopted from sport psychology and management training programs are reviewed. First, stress and distress are defined and the physical, physiological, and emotional responses to stress are discussed. This is followed by an overview of the biology of stress. Next, traditional forms of stress avoidance are examined and the concept of stress hardiness is identified. A holistic management model, adapted to the aviation environment, is proposed to position stress resistance training within the context of the overall stress experience. Finally, a support program, the Air Line Pilots Association's Critical Incident Response Program, which assists commercial pilots who face emotional work-related traumas, is discussed.",This paper provides a selective examination of the current stress management literature and its practices.

457,2016,PLoS One,Different Effects of Hypoxia on Mental Rotation of Normal and Mirrored Letters: Evidence from the Rotation-Related Negativity,"The present study explored the neural mechanism underlying the effect of moderate and transient hypoxic exposure on mental rotation of two-dimensional letters in both normal and mirror versions. Event-related potential data and behavioral data were acquired in the task of discrimination between normal and mirrored versions separately in conditions of normoxia (simulated sea level) and hypoxia conditions (simulated 5000 meter altitude). The behavioral results revealed no significant difference between the normoxia and hypoxia conditions both in response time and error rate. However, obvious differences between these two conditions in ERP were found. First, enlarged P300 and Rotation-related Negativity (RRN) were observed in the hypoxia condition compared to the normoxia condition only with normal letters. Second, the angle effect on the amplitude of RRN was more evident with normal letters in the hypoxia condition than that in the normoxia condition. However, this angle effect nearly disappeared with the mirrored letters in the hypoxia condition. Third, more bilateral parietal activation was observed in the hypoxia condition than the normoxia condition. These results suggested that the compensation mechanism existed in the hypoxia condition and was effective with normal letters but had little effect on the mirrored letters. This study extends the research about the hypoxic effect on spatial ability of humans by employing a mental rotation task and further provides neural evidence for this effect.",The present study explored the neural mechanism underlying the effect of moderate and transient hypoxic exposure on mental rotation of two-dimensional letters in both normal and mirror versions.

The system has seven components: detection, selection, description, classification, computation, interpretation, and local evaluation. Its unique features include no-fault reporting initiated by the individual discovering the event, who submits a report that is investigated by local quality assurance personnel and forwarded to a nonregulatory central system for computation and interpretation.An event-reporting system incorporated into present quality assurance and risk management efforts can help organizations address system structural and procedural weakness where the potential for errors can adversely affect health care outcomes. Input from the end users of the system as well as from external experts should enable this reporting system to serve as a useful model for others who may develop event-reporting systems in other medical domains."," To design, develop, and implement a prototype medical event-reporting system for use in transfusion medicine to improve transfusion safety by studying incidents and errors.The IDEALS concept of design was used to identify specifications for the event-reporting system, and a Delphi and subsequent nominal group technique meetings were used to reach consensus on the development of the system.

461,2023,PQDT - Global,Exploration of British Army Careers. Understanding Army Careers in Context: The Kaleidoscope Career Model,"This study explores the concept of careers within the context of the British Army, using the theoretical framework of the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM) and evaluates the use of the model for soldiers’ careers within the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME).Semi-structured interviews with 27 REME soldiers provided the data, which was analysed using thematic analysis. Interview findings demonstrated that soldiers recognise the opportunity for careers in the Army, a traditional organisational career and to be successful soldiers must understand the “rules of the game”.Contributions to knowledge include the exploration of KCM for REME soldier careers, the importance of timing the sequence of moves to align with future aspirations, whilst reflecting the authenticity of service, the need for balance at different career stages and the overarching need to challenge yourself. Army careers are typically within the challenge stage of life, most soldiers leaving do so to achieve balance and stability between work and life. Those who stay recognise the importance of sequencing moves and focusing effort in the “right” places to progress to the next rank.A Doctor of Business Administration (as opposed to a Doctor of Philosophy) aims to have a practical impact, with contributions to practice including raising awareness of the hysteresis of habitus, the challenge of changing the career model, and the associated lag in the widely understood view of career progression and career management. Addressing the lag has the potential to calibrate performance and expectations that allow “exceptional” personnel to promote ahead of traditional timelines. KCM helps Career Management Officers to have informed discussions with personnel, to think through their sequence of moves during routine assignments and on promotion to have a more fulfilling career that aligns with emerging career policy, ensuring people perform rather than hold back from demonstrating their full potential.This research concludes by recognising that careers are context-specific; Army careers and opportunities exist as traditional and hierarchical careers as the Army prepares for the future operating environment. Decisions on the size and shape of the Army continue to be based on the assessment of threats to British interests and the need to prepare for future conflict – a modern and agile Army, focusing on people who are the Army – to deliver capability in different environments. The Army career model is changing in response to the environment and require research to help understand it.","This study explores the concept of careers within the context of the British Army, using the theoretical framework of the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM) and evaluates the use of the model for soldiers’ careers within the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME).Semi-structured interviews with 27 REME soldiers provided the data, which was analysed using thematic analysis.

462,2021,PQDT - UK & Ireland,Umsetzungsstarke Teams Bei Der Flugsicherung in Der Schweiz Am Beispiel Skyguide Ag : Teams Im Fokus Volition,"This research project investigates the extent to which strengthening the volition of a team can positively influence the innovative power of a company. The focus is on the Swiss aviation industry. On the air traffic control company Skyguide because it is facing great challenges, which has intensified by the corona pandemic crisis. To cope with the situation, innovative teams with strong implementation capabilities needed. These teams must be flexible, agile and goal oriented. How such teams can be formed, which criteria must be fulfilled, and which framework conditions make success possible, is examined in this work. The embedding of air traffic control in the aviation industry has had an influence on the selected training and team development measures in the past. Team development has been a key issue in aviation for over 30 years. However, at Skyguide all efforts did not deliver the hoped-for success. The present research work closes this gap by means of a newly developed concept. The Team- Volition-Intervention-Concept (TVIK) closes the existing research gap in the field of aviation, Crew Resource Management (CRM), High Reliability Organization (HRO), Business Administration (BWL) and personality psychology and offers practical development opportunities for teams and individuals. Proven concepts from the aviation industry are selected, to increase the connectivity and acceptance among Skyguide employees. The most important factors influencing team volition identified, tested, and enriched with practical knowledge by means of literature and method research, guided and partially standardized expert interviews. As a result of this research project, the following influences on the implementation strength of teams are detected: 'team volition', 'team members', 'team organization', 'team leadership', 'team development' and 'enterprise'. Each main aspect is formed from various sub-aspects. As a central basis, the framework conditions and the corporate culture have proven to be decisive. All aspects influence each other, have an impact on the team volition and must be developed in a team through recurring reflections and appropriate measures. To build the bridge from theory to practice, the TVIK offers tips and supporting checklists that facilitate the applicability of the TVIK in a company.","This research project investigates the extent to which strengthening the volition of a team can positively influence the innovative power of a company.

Little is known, however, about the course of PTS after life threat in the absence of collateral stressors (e.g., bereavement, social stigma, property loss) and there is a scarcity of studies about PTS in the long term. This study assessed the short- and long-term course of PTS, and the influence of gender, education and age on the level and course of PTS, in survivors from a non-fatal airliner emergency landing caused by engine failure at an altitude of 1 km. There were 129 persons on board. A survey including the Impact of Event Scale was distributed to 106 subjects after 1 month, 4 months, 14 months, and 25 months, and to 95 subjects after 19 years (response rates 64–83%). There were initially high levels of PTS. The majority of changes in PTS occurred from 1 to 4 months after the event. There were small changes from 4 to 25 months but further decrease in PTS thereafter. Female gender was associated with higher levels of PTS whereas gender was unrelated to the slope of the short- and long-term trajectories. Higher education was related to a quicker recovery although not to initial or long-term PTS. Age was not associated with PTS. The present findings suggest that a life-threatening experience without collateral stressors may produce high levels of acute posttraumatic stress, yet with a benign prognosis. The findings further implicate that gender is unrelated to trajectories of recovery in the context of highly similar exposure and few collateral stressors.","Posttraumatic stress (PTS) is common in survivors from life-threatening events.

Of these, only 19 programs use formal learning objectives and dedicated education time to teach from ""good saves."" Thirty-six programs provide informal recognition, often in the form of a “shout-out.” Residency leadership is motivated to provide this recognition and learning through efforts to promote wellness and resiliency among EM residents. Notably, the use of prizes and awards is not necessary.Discussion: Some EM residencies in the United States are making targeted efforts to promote the recognition of successful clinical care. This recognition and education are being used as tools both to promote wellness and to teach resiliency. However, there is wide heterogeneity in approaches. Our survey provides examples of the many ways that “good saves” can be incorporated into any EM residency curriculum with the potential for significant impact.","Introduction: The practice of learning from medical errors is well-established and well-researched in the literature on morbidity and mortality conferences.

467,2013,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,Monitoring attentional state with fNIRS,"The ability to distinguish between high and low levels of task engagement in the real world is important for detecting and preventing performance decrements during safety-critical operational tasks. We therefore investigated whether functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a portable brain neuroimaging technique, can be used to distinguish between high and low levels of task engagement during the performance of a selective attention task. A group of participants performed the multi-source interference task (MSIT) while we recorded brain activity with fNIRS from two brain regions. One was a key region of the “task-positive” network, which is associated with relatively high levels of task engagement. The second was a key region of the “task-negative” network, which is associated with relatively low levels of task engagement (e.g., resting and not performing a task). Using activity in these regions as inputs to a multivariate pattern classifier, we were able to predict above chance levels whether participants were engaged in performing the MSIT or resting. We were also able to replicate prior findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indicating that activity in task-positive and task-negative regions is negatively correlated during task performance. Finally, data from a companion fMRI study verified our assumptions about the sources of brain activity in the fNIRS experiment and established an upper bound on classification accuracy in our task. Together, our findings suggest that fNIRS could prove quite useful for monitoring cognitive state in real-world settings.","The ability to distinguish between high and low levels of task engagement in the real world is important for detecting and preventing performance decrements during safety-critical operational tasks.

The endogenous variables considered in this study included petrochemical safety culture, personnel error behavior and personnel attitudes toward violation behaviors. Petrochemical personnel safety motivation was a mediating variable. This study’s findings highlight the importance of the perceived safety culture as a significant component of the organizational culture that influences employee behaviors and safety attitudes. This study further verifies the significant impact of the perceived safety culture in this industry sector on improving petrochemical personnel safety motivation and performance. Future research should explore the differences between the subcultures that have formed under larger safety cultures within similar high-risk industries, such as construction, aviation, manufacturing and mining.","This study assessed the perceived safety culture among five petrochemical production companies in Japan. Current effects of the perceived safety culture on employee safety motivation and performance were also examined. A total of 883 workers from the five petrochemical companies, which were located in the Chugoku region of Japan, provided valid responses to the survey distributed by email.","<title>Assessment of the perceived safety culture in the petrochemical industry in Japan: A cross-sectional study</title> <excerpt>This study assessed the perceived safety culture among five petrochemical production companies in Japan.

469,2014,Noise & Health,The effect on recognition memory of noise cancelling headphones in a noisy environment with native and nonnative speakers,"Noise has the potential to impair cognitive performance. For nonnative speakers, the effect of noise on performance is more severe than their native counterparts. What remains unknown is the effectiveness of countermeasures such as noise attenuating devices in such circumstances. Therefore, the main aim of the present research was to examine the effectiveness of active noise attenuating countermeasures in the presence of simulated aircraft noise for both native and nonnative English speakers. Thirty-two participants, half native English speakers and half native German speakers completed four recognition (cued) recall tasks presented in English under four different audio conditions, all in the presence of simulated aircraft noise. The results of the research indicated that in simulated aircraft noise at 65 dB(A), performance of nonnative English speakers was poorer than for native English speakers. The beneficial effects of noise cancelling headphones in improving the signal to noise ratio led to an improved performance for nonnative speakers. These results have particular importance for organizations operating in a safety-critical environment such as aviation.","Noise has the potential to impair cognitive performance.

471,2021,PLoS One,The study on the role of dedicators on promoting cooperation in public goods game,"In daily life, some people are always seen dedicating available resources to support collective activities. In this paper, we call these people who care group goals more than individual goals dedicators. Inspired by this phenomenon, we studied the role of dedicators on the evolution of cooperation in public goods game (PGG) based on a Chinese Folk Spring Festival Gala. Three types of agents were introduced into our PGG model including cooperators, defectors and dedicators. Dedicators tried to donate when the Gala was short of funds. Cooperators and defectors imitated the strategy of the highest-payoff neighbor based on the rational mechanism. And their imitating probability was modified on account of the emotional mechanism for positive effect of the dedicator’s donating behavior and negative effect of continuous poor performance. Through numerical simulations, we found that the existence of dedicators can indeed promote cooperation in PGG. It should be noted that dedicators’ willingness to donate was more important than their donation quantity in facilitating cooperation. And the stronger the emotional effect intensity of dedicators’ donating behavior was, the better. So, the selfless dedication of participants should be praised to promote cooperation by improving their emotional effect intensity. Last but not least, a reasonable activity budget was needed to sustain the highest level of cooperation.","In daily life, some people are always seen dedicating available resources to support collective activities.

We found new ways to capture the information coming from the workforce, in our case, the operations management team, and, merged this information with the data from the IoT sensors from the systems, enabling a holistic view of the entire operations occurring in real-time. In a Data Center environment, we have developed a set of tools for capturing the emotional data in order to detect potential biases caused by the specific mood of the person inside the operations team. We used Artificial Intelligence algorithms for finding the patterns that will help us to manage the system in the future. We compared and verified our findings with the existing references from other disciplines, e.g., Psychology. In this article, we expose some methods to be developed in future studies for supervising and increasing productivity in Data Centers, as a useful example for Smart Cities. Our research focuses on monitoring the mood and the emotional status of the personnel responsible for operating the system.

474,2025,Risk Analysis,Pilot flying versus pilot monitoring: The effect of role assignment on pilots’ perceived risk in flight simulation experiment,"Humans’ risk perception has been recognized as a significant factor affecting behavior safety. In the aviation domain, the two different roles of crews in the cockpit—pilot flying (PF) versus pilot monitoring (PM)—are responsible for different tasks. However, little is known about how role assignment shapes pilots’ perceived risk. We designed a flight‐simulation experiment where 57 professional pilots completed two counterbalanced approaches under different role assignments with the assistance of a flight instructor in a full flight simulator. Their perceived risks were measured by psychophysiological responses and compared between the two different cockpit roles. Results indicate that participants exhibited stronger psychophysiological responses (e.g., higher subjective ratings, skin conductance responses, heart rates, and inter‐beat intervals) when they served as PF than PM. Particularly, they reported higher scores in affect, susceptibility, and severity dimensions as PF than PM. The asymmetrically psychophysiological responses between the two varying roles in the cockpit emphasize the importance of controllability in shaping the pilot's perceived risk. Theoretically, our findings contribute to the existing literature on pilots’ perceived risk. Practically, we pave the way for engaging specific interventions and training for improving crew performance and flight safety.","Humans’ risk perception has been recognized as a significant factor affecting behavior safety.

475,2021,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Artistry in Air: The Story of the Younkins,"For sixty years, a Northwest Arkansas family has dominated the world of general aviation by drawing upon its wealth of expertise, innovation and exceptional talent. Jim Younkin, an electrical engineer, invented an autopilot series that revolutionized the industry. His son, Bobby became one of the top aerobatic pilots in the world and Jim’s grandchildren, Matt and Amanda, also became critically acclaimed performers in the air show business. Like his father, Matt is ranked among the best of pilots in the industry. Jim also received national recognition for his stunning recreations of and restorations of historical aircraft. Bobby operated Younkin Airshows, until he was killed in a mid-air collision in 2005. Following the tragedy, Matt and Amanda continued to operate the company. During this time, Amanda married air show pilot Kyle Franklin and they created a new act together which operated under his business. Tragically, Amanda died, after the Franklin plane crashed during a performance in 2011. Because the Younkin’s story is at the intersection of at least three theoretical research fields, it serves as a unique model providing important research information. This 52-minute film will detail the Younkins’ story and their significant contributions to aviation history, by approaching it through the lens of family business theory, performance theory and performance psychology.Because family business is considered the dominant form of enterprise in the U.S. economy and the issue of succession is one of its most important aspects, how the Younkins handled the continuation of their airshow business was of particular significance. As a family business transfers from the first generation to subsequent generations, its success rate diminishes. Despite the loss of family members from two generations in less than six years, Younkin Airshows has continued to thrive with Matt in the primary leadership role. In seeking to understand how this family was able to overcome the statistical odds and sustain their business, the qualitative interviews with Jim, Matt and Jeanie Younkin were crucial. Each of them provided key insight into the family dynamics of the group, particularly, Matt’s interview as he explained the physical and psychological factors that contributed to building family resilience. This resilience was also the result of a high level of trust between family members that had developed through intergenerational leadership within the family business and allowed them to overcome adversity. In addition, they shared a desire to preserve the Younkin family “brand” and experienced high levels of job satisfaction as they each contributed to it with their individual talents.Finally, through a shared passion for aviation augmented by high levels of resilience, trust and job satisfaction the Younkin family’s ability to rise above the tragedies that accompany a high-risk occupation are clearly demonstrated in this film. It will provide a unique case study in future research where family business theory, performance theory and performance psychology theory intersect.","For sixty years, a Northwest Arkansas family has dominated the world of general aviation by drawing upon its wealth of expertise, innovation and exceptional talent.

The present study, expanding upon an earlier study (Williams, 1988), required young aviators to process within the framework of a single eye fixation a briefly displayed foveally presented memory load while simultaneously trying to identify common peripheral targets presented on the same display at locations up to 4.5 degrees of visual angle from the fixation point. This task, as well as a character classification task (Williams, 1985, 1988), has been shown to be very difficult for nonaviators: It results in a tendency toward tunnel vision. Limited preliminary measurements of peripheral accuracy suggested that aviators might be less susceptible than nonaviators to this visual tunneling. The present study demonstrated moderate susceptibility to cognitively induced tunneling in aviators when the foveal task was sufficiently difficult and reaction time was the principal dependent measure.","Aviators are required rapidly and accurately to process enormous amounts of visual information located foveally and peripherally.

Despite its importance to health and professional performance, research on stress in crisis management remains scarce. The present study aimed to investigate self-reported stress and psychophysiological stress responses in crisis managers. For this purpose, 30 crisis managers were compared with 30 managers from other disciplines, in terms of self-reported stress, health status and psychophysiological reactivity to crisis-related and non-specific visual and acoustic aversive stimuli and cognitive challenge. Crisis managers reported lower stress levels, a more positive strain-recuperation-balance, greater social resources, reduced physical symptoms, as well as more physical exercise and less alcohol consumption. They exhibited diminished electrodermal and heart rate responses to crisis-related and non-specific stressors. The results indicate reduced stress and physical complaints, diminished psychophysiological stress reactivity, and a healthier life-style in crisis managers. Improved stress resistance may limit vulnerability to stress-related performance decline and facilitate preparedness for major incidents.","Directing disaster operations represents a major professional challenge.

479,2012,PQDT - Global,The Design and Development of a Best Practice Use-Of-Force Training Model for the Private Security Industry,"The private security industry plays an ever increasing role in protecting people and assets globally. The use of force in the private security environment is an area of concern for many groups and individuals. Role-players range from individual officers, who may have to put their lives in harm’s way whilst carrying out their duties, to regulators tasked with enforcing legislative compliance. There are various points of view and levels of concern regarding use of force by private security officers. Incidents where innocent civilians were killed by private security contractors in countries such as Iraq are most relevant to this study. Equally, incidents involving Crowd Controllers who may use force on a nightly basis to manage rowdy patrons, are just as important (and sometimes just as lethal). With the roles of traditional policing and the private security industry becoming more inter-related every day, the use of force by the private security industry cannot be ignored.The core concerns regarding use of force are twofold. Firstly is the issue of the use of excessive force and secondly is the need to constantly enhance the safety levels for all parties (security officers, assailants and innocent bystanders). Addressing these concerns is impossible without a systematic structure that ensures officers are adequately trained and equipped for the job-related activities that they must conduct. This research indicated the need not only for an integrated system of training and acclimatisation (familiarisation) to the use of force, but also for a model of assessment that measures use-of-force competency. The perishable nature of use-of-force skills means that training should expand to include on-going refresher and skills training as well as regular competency assessments. The need to train officers for the real thing is of paramount importance. They need to be taught to manage adrenal response in order to perform effectively under the extreme duress of an attack situation. Existing force continua provide guidelines for use-of-force but fail to provide recommendations on how officers should be trained to actually apply the guidelines (in physical and psychological terms) that most continua prescribe.Early on in the research it was identified that the scope and duties of officers in the private security industry are very wide. The vast majority of security officers operate in a low risk static guarding role, where the likelihood of having to utilise force is very low. The rest of the industry engages in higher risk activities such as Cash-in-Transit, Crowd Control or Close Protection. In order to create an appropriate structure applicable for use-of-force training, the officers in the security industry were divided into four broad categories based on their level of use-of-force options and the risk level of the environment that they operate in. These four categories are as follows:1. Security officers who operate unarmed with no alternative weapons (this means that the officer is completely unarmed and does not carry any ancillary equipment such as a torch or handcuffs). This category is applicable to low risk level functions that have a low likelihood of officers having to face an attack situation.","The private security industry plays an ever increasing role in protecting people and assets globally.

480,2014,PLoS One,Over the Hill at 24: Persistent Age-Related Cognitive-Motor Decline in Reaction Times in an Ecologically Valid Video Game Task Begins in Early Adulthood,"Typically studies of the effects of aging on cognitive-motor performance emphasize changes in elderly populations. Although some research is directly concerned with when age-related decline actually begins, studies are often based on relatively simple reaction time tasks, making it impossible to gauge the impact of experience in compensating for this decline in a real world task. The present study investigates age-related changes in cognitive motor performance through adolescence and adulthood in a complex real world task, the real-time strategy video game StarCraft 2. In this paper we analyze the influence of age on performance using a dataset of 3,305 players, aged 16-44, collected by Thompson, Blair, Chen & Henrey [1]. Using a piecewise regression analysis, we find that age-related slowing of within-game, self-initiated response times begins at 24 years of age. We find no evidence for the common belief expertise should attenuate domain-specific cognitive decline. Domain-specific response time declines appear to persist regardless of skill level. A second analysis of dual-task performance finds no evidence of a corresponding age-related decline. Finally, an exploratory analyses of other age-related differences suggests that older participants may have been compensating for a loss in response speed through the use of game mechanics that reduce cognitive load.","Typically studies of the effects of aging on cognitive-motor performance emphasize changes in elderly populations.

481,2006,Human Factors,The Relationship Between Safety Climate and Recent Accidents: Behavioral Learning and Cognitive Attributions,"Objective: The association between accidents and subsequent work unit safety perceptions was assessed to address cognitive and behavioral changes following accidents. Background: Many studies attempt to predict accident rates using measures of work unit safety, but effects vary considerably. Conversely, this study examined whether recent accidents may be positively associated with work unit safety perceptions, as suggested by behavioral learning mechanisms (increases in safety investments following accidents) or cognitive mechanisms (defensive attributions regarding accident causality). Method: Lagged squadron-level accident experience was correlated with work unit safety perceptions obtained through a 61-question safety climate survey administered to 6,361 individuals in U.S. Navy flight squadrons. Results: Positive associations between minor or intermediately severe accidents and future safety climate scores were found, although no effect was found for major accidents. Conclusion: We suggest that accident history should be considered when examining work unit safety perceptions because recent accidents may be associated with higher safety climate scores. We did not find that this varies systematically with accident severity, and longitudinal research on additional samples is needed to further test this possibility. Application: This research may be used to refine measurement of work unit safety and to examine impacts of accidents or safety violations on workers' cognitive processes and group behavioral changes.

486,2009,PQDT - Global,A Preliminary Study on Passive and Active Flutter Suppression Concepts for Aeronautical Components,"The scope of this work is to study computationally both passive and active flutter suppression characteristics of a cantilever cork agglomerate core sandwich with CFRP facings and an aluminum plate, the latter through the application of piezoelectric patches, respectively. Recently, cork agglomerates have been gaining an increasing interest from the aerospace industry due to their good thermal and acoustic insulation capabilities. In addition, cork based materials intrinsically have excellent vibration suppression properties, which suggest that the combination of cork with high performance composites (such as CFRPs) may lead to high specific strength materials with improved damping characteristics suitable for flutter prevention.Sandwich specimens were modeled using commercially available software ANSYS® and a demo version of ZAERO® software for the determination of the flutter speed and related frequencies. ANSYS® piezoelectric modeling and transient analysis capabilities were used for the active vibration study. Specimen aspect ratio and thickness were chosen as a function of wind tunnel maximum speed for further experimental tests. Results were compared with conventional CFRP and aluminum plates.It was demonstrated that a cork agglomerate core sandwich with CFRP facings can act as a natural flutter suppresser which allows the reduction of the wing weight for a given flight envelope and that the application of piezoelectric actuators is a valuable aeroelastic control concept. An increase of about 20% in flutter speed was achieved using actuated piezoelectric devices. The main goal remains in investigating higher strain smart materials and control strategies, since these improvements are only possible in small structures.","The scope of this work is to study computationally both passive and active flutter suppression characteristics of a cantilever cork agglomerate core sandwich with CFRP facings and an aluminum plate, the latter through the application of piezoelectric patches, respectively.

487,2022,"Attention, Perception and Psychophysics",Attention control in a demanding dynamic time-sharing environment: An eye-tracking study,"In this study, we examined different models of cognitive control in dynamic time-sharing situations. We investigated attentional allocation by registering participants' eye movements while they performed a new time-sharing task that forced them to solve resource conflicts between subtasks through prioritization. Participants were monitoring four subtasks each requiring different amounts of visual attention and response frequencies. Participants' attention allocation was operationalized in terms of the time spent dwelling on subtasks, the rate they visually sampled the tasks, and the duration of dwells. Additionally, the accuracy of responses and efficiency of time-sharing were estimated. In Experiment 1, we studied adaptation to a time-sharing environment in which priority order of the subtasks was kept constant from trial to trial. We found that the participants sampled the most important subtasks more frequently, spent more time on them, and shifted their gaze earlier to them than to less important subtasks. That is, they allocated their attention according to the subtask priorities. In Experiment 2, subtask priorities changed from trial to trial. Despite the higher demands of the constantly changing situation, participants again adapted to the varying priorities of the subtasks almost instantly. Our results suggest that performance in complex and dynamic time-sharing situations is not managed by a system relying on liberal resource allocation policies and gradual learning. Instead, the participants' rapid adaptation is more consistent with tighter executive and authoritative control and intelligent use of prioritization information.","In this study, we examined different models of cognitive control in dynamic time-sharing situations.

488,2002,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Decision -making styles associated with accidents: Defining the high -risk pilot,"This dissertation describes a cognitive psychology based program designed to improve aviation safety. The study was founded upon over 24 years of research, development, and experimental validation in the area of pilot decision-making. It was determined in the early 1970s that 51.6% of the fatal general aviation accidents were due to faulty decision-making. This lead to an effort to determine if decision-making could be taught, if so, how it could be taught, and then, how its impact could be assessed. All of these efforts are described in the Background section. This dissertation deals with development and evaluation of the next generation of Aeronautical Decision-making training materials. The purpose of this research was to characterize the decision-making styles of accident free and accident-prone pilots. The psychological basis of the Decision-Making Styles (DMS) instrument is discussed in detail, including extensive evidence for a variety of host factors that influence decision-making. The development of the DMS instrument is described including: content, Subject Matter Expert interviews, preliminary evaluation using a convenience sample, and a (N = 500) pre-test. The first step in this study was to validate the DMS instrument with an extensive, experimental survey of approximately 4000 pilots. The hypotheses were designed to determine whether the ten categories of 122 decision-making variables tested are associated with having an aviation accident, incident, or near accident (cases) in comparison with those who have been accident free (controls). This information data set provides a rich core of knowledge that has not been analyzed before as a whole. The ultimate goal was to use this core of information to develop a global index related to a pilot's propensity for accidents. The method of data collection is discussed in detail. This includes a review of the methods proposed for analyzing the DMS instrument data, selection of participants for the mailing, their classification as cases or controls, and the mailing procedures. Mailing procedures to ensure a high response rate are outlined, and data collection procedures are summarized. The proposed measures and methods for data analysis are described. Due to the predominance of Lickert scale type of data, the primary analyses focuses on the nonparametric Mann-Whitney Test. The results are organized into confirmed, unconfirmed, and anecdotal hypotheses. The confirmed hypotheses resulted in a description of accident-prone pilots as more likely to: expose themselves to high risk flying experiences, feel time pressure when making decisions, have a false sense of their ability to handle the situation, and not review alternative options or solutions. In addition, the analyses included the development of a discriminant function to determine if cases and controls could be correctly classified using the DMS instrument. It was found that 80.1% could be correctly classified using the entire 122 question set. If a simplified seven variable (26 question) set was used, 68.2% of the cases and controls could be correctly classified.","This dissertation describes a cognitive psychology based program designed to improve aviation safety.

Using an individuation-separation process framework from family systems theory, we also examined associations between college student's retrospective self-report of their parents' helicopter parenting and their own psychological adjustment. Four hundred twelve students from 13 private universities in Korea completed a questionnaire about their parent's parenting and their own psychological adjustment measured in locus of control and emotional well-being. The finding of an one-factor solution does not support our hypothesis that there may be a difference in the conceptualization of helicopter parenting between Korea and the U.S. samples. Findings indicate perceived helicopter parenting was negatively associated with college students' internal locus of control. Although there was no direct link from helicopter parenting to Korean college students' emotional well-being, the association of helicopter parenting to emotional well-being was indirect through its link to students' locus of control.","The purpose of the present study is to revisit and validate the current conceptualization of helicopter parenting with Korean college students by using the Helicopter Parenting Scale.

490,2017,PQDT - UK & Ireland,Aviation safety : a framework to analyse airspace infringements involving general aviation flights,"The increasing number of commercial flights, e.g. a scheduled passenger flight operated by an airline, requires that all air aviation operations must follow the airspace rules and procedures in order to enhance safety. Since commercial flights comprise the majority of civilian flights, most of a country’s airspace is designed to meet its needs. As a consequence, airspace design and procedures primarily meet the needs of such flights. For example, controlled airspace is under the jurisdiction of the Airspace Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) and thus, the Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) is responsible for the management of flights within the airspace including authorisation for entry and exit. There are, however, situations in which aircraft enter controlled airspace without authorisation of the ATCO. When this happens, a safety incident known as an airspace infringement (AI) is recorded. Such incidents can cause safety as well as other air traffic management problems, such as delays, with the worst case being a mid-air collision. According to European statistics, approximately 5% of reported AIs in European airspace led to a loss of separation between 2010 and 2014. A distinctive characteristic of AIs is that they mostly involve general aviation (GA) flights that significantly differ from commercial flights. An immediate consequence of this is that current reporting, investigation and analysis schemes are designed for commercial aviation and thus, incidents involving GA are inadequately reported in the safety database of ANSPs and national aviation authorities. This unsurprising given that on average approximately 20% of reported AIs in Europe were not analysed between 2010 and 2014. Furthermore, not all GA aircraft are adequately detected by the air traffic service infrastructure and thus, AIs might be underreported. GA in itself represents a diverse group of airspace users and has unique relationships with aviation stakeholders at the national and European level which are not well described in the literature. Two seminal studies of AIs that focused on GA were conducted in the last decade by the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) and Civil Aviation Authority of United Kingdom (UK CAA). These studies provided a relatively good overview of the context in which AIs occurred in European airspace in the period 2003-2008. Whilst important contributory factors to AIs were determined, they did not relate to a GA pilot’s decision making, the flying style of each GA aircraft or the use of emerging technologies. Such factors can be found in the literature relating to human factors and aviation psychology. Nonetheless, the factors of these AI studies were not found in reported AI incidents, which are the key data for any safety analysis. Despite efforts to mitigate their occurrence at both national and European level, AIs continue to occur both in controlled and restricted airspace. Although a small proportion of AIs results in a loss of prescribed separation between aircraft, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, AIs pose the risk of a mid-air collision in controlled and restricted airspace. GA remains the key contributor to these incidents whilst it faces technological and regulatory changes that can affect their operations and subsequently, the occurrence of AIs. Significant improvements have also been made to the safety databases of aviation stakeholders. However, according to recent European safety reports, there is a need for both a systematic reporting and safety analysis to meet the increasing size of the safety databases. Therefore, this thesis addresses these current limitations and proposes a holistic framework to analyse AIs at the national level to enhance safety. This framework utilises both the developed taxonomy of contributory factors for GA and the developed framework that systematically analyses reported AIs. This thesis also reviews the GA flying activity including the operations and a pilot’s performance. The developments of this thesis are summarised below. GA is extensively described from a review of various documents and interviews with the GA pilots conducted in this thesis. The latter reveals the manner by which recreational GA pilots currently plan and navigate as well as the information they need to do so. This description can also be used by the stakeholders to identify the needs of the GA pilots and to review airspace rules and procedures to meet these needs. With respect to AIs, this thesis develops and validates a novel and bespoke taxonomy of contributory factors of AIs, referred to as GA-Contributory factors to AIs (GA-Saf(ArI)) for GA flights. The taxonomy is derived from an extensive literature review of GA pilots’ performance, past studies of AIs and the rigorous analysis of reported AIs and semi-structured interviews with GA pilots. The taxonomy consists of 145 contributory factors and 52% of these factors were derived solely from the interviews, highlighting the importance of collecting data directly from GA pilots. Amongst the findings is that the flight-route decision of GA pilots to fly very close to controlled airspace, mostly over capital cities, increases the likelihood of an AI. In such flights, the aircraft can stray into controlled airspace when the pilot fails to notice the change of the aircraft’s heading due to the wind. The taxonomy GA-Saf(ArI) can be used by the stakeholders to analyse AIs as well as other incidents involving GA flights. This thesis also develops, tests and validates a framework, referred to as Proactive Safety Analysis of Reported AIs (Pro-Saf(Ari)). This framework overcomes current limitations through a systematic and speedy analysis of reported incidents. It assesses the quality of the data, extensively studies the incident’s contextual and contributory factors and applies statistical analysis. Given the current database’s structures, the success of the analysis depends on the narrative. The more detail the narrative is, the more likely the contextual and contributory factors to be determined. The uniqueness of AIs is that most AIs are reported by the ATCO than the infringing pilot. Whilst their detailed narrative is useful, it fails to report information on what happened inside the aircraft, such as the flight-route decision making of pilots. The framework is applicable to databases of different quality, size and origin, i.e. ATCO’s and pilot’s reports, and thus, it can be used by the stakeholders. Finally, this thesis develops a holistic framework, referred to as Safety analysis of AIs at the national level (Pro-Saf(ArI)N). The Pro-Saf(ArI)N framework offers a systematic approach to collect, investigate and analyse the AIs reported by both the ATCO and GA pilot. It utilises the taxonomy GA-Saf(ArI) to investigate the reported incidents and the framework Pro-Saf(Ari) to statistically analyse the contextual and contributory factors. Such a holistic framework allows the stakeholders to monitor AIs, assess the safety risk of a mid-air collision caused by an AI and design a mitigation action plan to prevent AIs from occurring at national level. A quantitative method is applied to measure the efficacy of a mitigation action. From the application of the framework, a series of mitigation actions are proposed. Furthermore, improvements of the Safety Management System of the ANSP are proposed including the improvement of the reporting scheme.","The increasing number of commercial flights, eg a scheduled passenger flight operated by an airline, requires that all air aviation operations must follow the airspace rules and procedures in order to enhance safety.

491,2006,Behavior Research Methods,Investigating systematic individual differences in sleep-deprived performance on a high-fidelity flight simulator,"Laboratory research has revealed considerable systematic variability in the degree to which individuals' alertness and performance are affected by sleep deprivation. However, little is known about whether or not different populations exhibit similar levels of individual variability. In the present study, we examined individual variability in performance impairment due to sleep loss in a highly select population of military jet pilots. Ten active-duty F-117 pilots were deprived of sleep for 38 h and studied repeatedly in a high-fidelity flight simulator. Data were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA to quantify individual variability. Statistically significant, systematic individual differences in the effects of sleep deprivation were observed, even when baseline differences were accounted for. The findings suggest that highly select populations may exhibit individual differences in vulnerability to performance impairment from sleep loss just as the general population does. Thus, the scientific and operational communities' reliance on group data as opposed to individual data may entail substantial misestimation of the impact of job-related Stressors on safety and performance.

493,2020,PQDT - Global,The Influence of Consumer Personal Values on Airline Choice Within the South African Domestic Market,"Airline choice is of interest to both airline product development and marketing personnel and academics. While most of the studies airline choice/service quality only identify airlines service attributes essential to customers, this study employed personal values to extend and provide the reasons why airline service attributes are not or essential to passengers. Personal values are presented in the literature as the ultimate life goals individuals seek to attain in all aspects of their lives; hence, guide their behaviour. Based on this, the main objective of this study was to examine and identify the consumer (passenger) personal values that underpin the evaluation of airline service attributes used to choose an airline within the South African domestic passenger market. To achieve this objective, together with the secondary objectives, a quantitative descripto-explanatory research design was employed to guide data collection and analysis. A sample of 324 respondents was selected using a hybrid technique of convenience, and snowball sampling techniques and data were collected using both an online and hardcopy questionnaire. Data obtained were sorted and cleaned for analysis using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS 26) and the Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS Version 26) software. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to assess factor structures of observed variables and identify latent constructs. The factorability of portrait value questionnaire (PVQ) items was determined using the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Hypotheses were tested using the backward multiple regression analysis, Whitney-Mann test, Spearman correlation and hierarchical regression with Hayes’ Process Macro. The study identified five of Schwartz’s 19 refined values as significantly influencing the evaluation and prioritisation of airline service attributes. A state of indifference among customers was found when the impact of airline service attributes was tested, with only onboard services found to significantly influence post-purchase outcomes such as satisfaction, loyalty and repeat purchase behaviour. It was also found that passengers did not distinguish between low-cost and full-service carriers. Income only moderated the influence of stimulation and self-direction thought values on airline service attributes while marketing communications effort was found to have a direct than a moderating role. In the main, these findings bring a novel and rich way of explaining airline choice through personal values. The results are essential for airline market segmentation, positioning and the development of airline products or features that match passenger desired life goals (personal values) which are touted as a guide to their choice behaviour.","Airline choice is of interest to both airline product development and marketing personnel and academics.

494,2015,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,Surgeons' Attitudes Are Associated With Reoperation and Readmission Rates," Attitudes influence how people make decisions. In an effort to decrease pilot judgment-related accidents, the Federal Aviation Administration teaches new pilots about hazardous attitudes that are believed to be incompatible with safe flight: macho, impulsive, worry, resignation, self-confidence, and antiauthority. If these attitudes are hazardous for pilots and their passengers, they may also be incompatible with the reliable and safe delivery of surgical care.The purposes of this study were (1) to ascertain to what extent surgeons harbor hazardous attitudes; and (2) to determine their relationship, if any, to reoperation and readmission rates.We selected validated aviation psychology tools that are used to measure these attitudes in pilots. We converted the aviation scenarios to analogous situations for surgeons and invited all surgeons from one academic program to participate in this study. A total of 41 surgeons were eligible to participate; 37 (90%) completed the attitude prevalence protocol and 31 (76%) had complete reoperation and readmission data for the correlation and regression analysis. Attending orthopaedic surgeons completed the Modified Surgeon Hazardous Attitude Scale as well as a series of additional instruments.Levels of macho thought to be hazardous in pilots were present in nine (24%) surgeons. Similar, elevated levels of self-confidence were found in three (8%) surgeons. High levels of impulsivity were found in 5% (two surgeons) and high levels of antiauthority were found in 3% (one surgeon). Only one (3%) surgeon reported elevated levels of worry and no surgeon reported hazardous levels of resignation. Thirty percent (11 surgeons) of surgeons harbored at least one elevated attitude level. In a regression model, macho attitude levels predicted 19% of the variation in surgeons' rate of readmissions and reoperations.High levels of hazardous attitudes may not be consistent with the routine delivery of safe surgical care in a teamwork setting where human factors and safe systems are the key to success. Further research is needed to determine if abnormally high levels of these hazardous attitudes impact patient care.Level II, prognostic study.

496,2013,The Qualitative Report,Prototype Modeling vs. Item Response Theory - A Paradigm Shift for Measurement Professionals,"In science, the usual research mode is to discover cause-and-effect mechanisms operating behind superficial reality. Aviation, for example, uses prototype modeling to develop improved aircraft from one generation to the next. In stark contrast to prototype modeling's search for causal mechanisms, assessment technologies remain dominated by probability strategies-which is why psychological assessment lags behind the hard sciences. A major difference in results exists between inferences produced through item response theory versus the cause-effect prototyping strategies of aerospace and other techno-savvy industries. Parallel to aerospace strategies, systems analysis of language, using prototype modeling strategies, provides an effective assessment technology. This paper shows how the result provides causal mechanisms easily employed for assessing, predicting and changing human performance in many contexts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","In science, the usual research mode is to discover cause-and-effect mechanisms operating behind superficial reality. Aviation, for example, uses prototype modeling to develop improved aircraft from one generation to the next. In stark contrast to prototype modeling's search for causal mechanisms, assessment technologies remain dominated by probability strategies-which is why psychological assessment lags behind the hard sciences.","<title>Prototype Modeling vs. Item Response Theory - A Paradigm Shift for Measurement Professionals</title> <excerpt>In science, the usual research mode is to discover cause-and-effect mechanisms operating behind superficial reality.

497,2025,Safety in Extreme Environments,Human reliability assessment and accident prevention: a bayesian network approach to identify and mitigate human error,"This study aimed to investigate the key factors influencing human performance and develop a quantitative model to predict human error in occupational settings.The research utilized a multi-method approach, combining HFACS for accident analysis, HEART for task-based HRA, and FANP for validating performance shaping factors (PSFs). A Bayesian network was subsequently constructed and validated through sensitivity analysis.Analysis of 235 accidents revealed that the majority occurred in operations and maintenance, with unsafe actions and inadequate supervision being the primary contributing factors. HRA identified 26 high-risk tasks. The Bayesian model demonstrated that factors such as physical limitations, hostile work environments, excessive mental stress, time constraints, skill-job mismatches, and unclear responsibilities significantly impact human performance.The findings highlight the crucial role of both environmental and individual factors in human error. To mitigate human error, the study recommends a multifaceted approach including improved training, enhanced working conditions, and the establishment of a strong safety culture. This research provides valuable insights for enhancing workplace safety by identifying and mitigating human error risks.","This study aimed to investigate the key factors influencing human performance and develop a quantitative model to predict human error in occupational settings.The research utilized a multi-method approach, combining HFACS for accident analysis, HEART for task-based HRA, and FANP for validating performance shaping factors (PSFs).

498,2019,Journal of Managerial Psychology,Family influence mediates the relation between helicopter-parenting and millennial work attitudes,"PurposeDrawing from life course theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of family influence on career development (FICD) on the relationship of helicopter-parenting (over-parenting behavior) and US millennials’ work attitudes.Design/methodology/approachIn Study 1 (n=268), confirmatory factor analysis was tested on all scales to derive fit models. Mediation analyses using PROCESS (Preacher and Hayes, 2004) were conducted on Study 1 and Study 2 (n=196) on survey collected data sets.FindingsCapturing life course theorists’ proposition that parental involvement now extends itself through childhood and into millennials’ adulthood, results from both studies indicate helicopter-parenting is related to FICD. Further, for both studies, information support (FICD factor) positively mediates the relationship between helicopter-parenting and, affective commitment and job satisfaction, and negatively mediates the relationship between helicopter-parenting and turnover intentions. Additionally, direct effects on helicopter-parenting on work outcomes were found in both studies.Practical implicationsCEOs and managers seem perplexed on how to manage millennial workers. Understanding the co-occurring positive and negative effects of the millennial-parent relationship on work attitudes can help alleviate this conundrum to create better supervision, retention and engagement of millennial workers.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the sparse empirical literature on millennial’s work attitudes and is the first to provide empirical evidence of the role parents play in shaping millennial’s work attitudes. The findings highlight the concerns CEOs have in managing their millennial workers via their parental relationship and provide insightful management strategies.","PurposeDrawing from life course theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of family influence on career development (FICD) on the relationship of helicopter-parenting (over-parenting behavior) and US millennials’ work attitudes.Design/methodology/approachIn Study 1 (n=268), confirmatory factor analysis was tested on all scales to derive fit models.

499,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Crafting a System of Profound Knowledge Management in Long-Term Care,"The paradigm shift to a knowledge economy, predicted by Drucker, is currently reflected in a knowing-to-doing gap in healthcare, potentially threatening the lives of long-term care (LTC) residents and sustainability of LTC organizations. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to seek a substantive conceptual theory to explain how LTC uses knowledge management (KM) to improve performance by probing the a priori views and lived experiences of 11 LTC knowledge creators, managers, and users. Data were collected via semi structured interviews that were transcribed and coded. The research questions guided by the conceptual concentrated on how KM is used in LTC, what KM processes enhance or inhibit performance in LTC, the nature of knowledge in LTC, and the potential impact of Deming’s theory of profound knowledge on KM in LTC. Data analysis included coding, categorizing, constant comparison, conceptualizing, and theorizing to reveal a tentative unified theory of crafting a system of KM in LTC that theoretically extends Deming’s organizational theory of profound knowledge to integrate the individual knower within Deming’s organizational perspectives. Findings included participant use of sentinel data and bridging decisions in response to emergent knowledge needs, risk management versus quality management performance drivers, and participant perceptions of resource dependence in response to emergent knowledge needs. Findings also include social change implications for LTC facilities, residents, and staff driven by systematic KM to facilitate clinical best practices, lessons learned, and resourcing the use of knowledge to enhance LTC performance capabilities. Study conclusions include a call for future research related to study findings across the healthcare continuum.","The paradigm shift to a knowledge economy, predicted by Drucker, is currently reflected in a knowing-to-doing gap in healthcare, potentially threatening the lives of long-term care (LTC) residents and sustainability of LTC organizations.

502,2025,Cognitive Science,The Sustained Attention Paradox: A Critical Commentary on the Theoretical Impossibility of Perfect Vigilance,"The human capacity for sustained attention represents a critical cognitive paradox: while essential for numerous high‐stakes tasks, perfect vigilance is fundamentally impossible. This commentary explores the theoretical impossibility of maintaining uninterrupted attention, drawing from extensive interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology. Multiple converging lines of evidence demonstrate that sustained attention is constrained by neural, biological, and cognitive limitations. Neural mechanisms reveal that attention operates through rhythmic oscillations, with inherent fluctuations in frontoparietal networks and default mode network interactions. Neurochemical systems and cellular adaptation effects further underscore the impossibility of continuous, perfect vigilance. Empirical research across domains—including aviation, healthcare, industrial safety, and security—consistently demonstrates rapid declines in attention performance over time, regardless of individual expertise or motivation. Even elite performers like military personnel and experienced meditators exhibit inevitable attention lapses. This paper presents an argument against traditional approaches that seek to overcome these limitations through training or willpower. Instead, it advocates for designing human–technology systems that work harmoniously with cognitive constraints. This requires developing adaptive automation, understanding individual and cultural attention variations, and creating frameworks that strategically balance human capabilities with technological support.","The human capacity for sustained attention represents a critical cognitive paradox: while essential for numerous high‐stakes tasks, perfect vigilance is fundamentally impossible.

509,2025,Journal of Child and Family Studies,Parent and Adolescent Reports of Helicopter Parenting: Discrepancies and Associations with Adolescent Depression and Anxiety,"Research is replete with studies on Helicopter Parenting (HP), but most studies are cross-sectional and include college student samples. Studies with college students usually find that HP is associated with negative outcomes, but this might not be the case with high school students as high levels of parental involvement, advice, and monitoring is more normative and potentially adaptive given teens’ development stage. Thus, the current study adds to the literature by focusing on high school adolescents and by including both parents’ and adolescents’ perspectives on helicopter parenting, as well as reporter discrepancies, to predict adolescents’ depression and anxiety symptoms longitudinally. The sample was 235 adolescents (Mage = 15.12, SD = .48) and at least one parent recruited from the Appalachian region in the Southeastern US. Adolescents and parents reported on measures of HP, and adolescents reported on symptoms of depression and anxiety one year later. Analyses were regression models predicting Wave 2 adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms while covarying parent income, teen gender, and Wave 1 teen depression or anxiety symptoms. Contrary to hypotheses and most research with emerging adults, teen reports of paternal helicopter parenting predicted lower adolescents’ depressive symptoms one year later. Similarly, mother reports of HP were associated with lower teen anxiety symptoms longitudinally. However consistent with hypotheses, larger difference scores between father and teen reports of HP (fathers’ reports higher relative to teens’) predicted more teen depressive symptoms at Wave 2. Overall, the study emphasizes the need to understand both parent and child perspectives of parenting and the meaning of discrepant perspectives. Additionally, more research with high school teens is needed to better understand how adaptive or maladaptive HP may be at this age.HighlightsHelicopter parenting of adolescents is negatively associated with adolescents’ internalizing symptoms one year later.Greater father-teen reporting differences in Helicopter Parenting predicted higher teen depressive symptoms.Understanding both parent and teen perspectives of parenting and discrepancies is important.","Research is replete with studies on Helicopter Parenting (HP), but most studies are cross-sectional and include college student samples.

513,2022,The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,"RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL WAR, ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WORK PRESSURE -- TAKING HANGZHOU CENTRAL AIRCRAFT FACTORY AS AN EXAMPLE","BackgroundIn February 1934, Nanjing municipal government signed a contract with the representatives of Shanghai aircraft manufacturing company composed of American CODIS and Douglas airlines to introduce American technology and establish Hangzhou central aircraft manufacturing plant north of Hangzhou Jianqiao aviation school airport. China Hangzhou factory is a joint stock limited company established by China and the United States, but the management organization is established and controlled by the United States. Most managers and technicians are Americans. Its working pressure can be imagined.Subjects and MethodsUsing the method of historical review, this study analyzed the working background and conditions of Chinese manufacturing personnel at that time, analyzed their anxiety and depression at that time, and on this basis, they operated in the mode of American military industry, trained Chinese workers and apprentices, and assembled, maintained and manufactured aircraft. In about eight years, the company has repaired, assembled and manufactured nearly 600 aircraft, the largest number compared with other aircraft manufacturers. In the context of the Anti Japanese War, it experienced two migrations, the first to Wuhan, Hubei, the second to Leiyun, Yunnan, and finally disintegrated in the war. Its fate is closely related to the Anti Japanese War, which also determines that its production purpose is to serve China's Anti Japanese war. In order to win the war, they endured great work pressure and unprecedented depression. Many people suffered from mental disorders. According to incomplete statistics, at that time, nearly 2000 people suffered from mental diseases to varying degrees.ResultsIn the tide of national unity and resistance against Japan, under the guidance of the Aviation Commission, China Hangzhou factory contacted the local government, relied on the strength of the factory, explored the development path, and produced high-quality aircraft, which once created enterprise prosperity. The Chinese air force sent the aircraft made by AVIC into the blue sky, fought with the Japanese army, turned Changhong into Bi, and won world praise for the combat aircraft carrier made by the air force and AVIC. At that time, the foundation of the aviation industry was weak, there was a shortage of funds and technical talents.ConclusionThe Chinese government adopts the form of joint venture to introduce production technology, and uses talents from China and the United States to repair and manufacture aircraft. This is an effective way to rapidly promote the development of China's military aviation industry and provides the material basis and technical talents for the Chinese Air Force's Anti Japanese war. However, the power of China's Hangzhou factory was shelved. On the one hand, this is due to China's lack of technology, equipment and talents. On the other hand, it is caused by “power politics” and “weak country diplomacy”. However, these can not erase the achievements of China's aviation industry and its contribution to the war of resistance against Japan. At the same time, it reminds us that we should pay more attention to the mental health of aerospace personnel, especially actively cultivate, encourage and promote Aerospace spirit, especially pay attention to the role of emotional labor spirit; At the same time, we should pay more attention to the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship. It is necessary to actively cultivate and encourage entrepreneurship in infrastructure construction, rule of law construction, platform construction and service provision. Aerospace enterprises should make full use of government policies, rely on government services, cultivate and carry forward the spirit of innovation based on the market environment, improve the vitality and quality of innovation, and improve the construction productivity.

514,2017,PQDT - Global,"Effect of Concurrent White Noise and Acute Hypobaric Hypoxia on Selective Attention, Implicit Association and Visuospatial Working Memory Function","Background and Introduction:Cognitive performance issues in pilots are pervasive in nature and have important safety implications. Noise and hypoxia are the commonly encountered aviation stressors. Deterioration of cognitive function due to hypoxia, especially beyond 10,000 ft altitude, is a historically proven fact. The effect of noise is equivocal from detrimental to no effect, even improvement. Literature regarding the concurrent effect of these dual stressors on cognitive function are sparse. In this study, an effort has been made to assess the effect of white noise and simulated hypoxia of 14,000 ft altitude on human cognitive function both independently as well as concurrently.Material and Methods:30 healthy volunteers (28 male, 02 female) with mean age of 28.7 ± 4 yrs participated in the study. Cognitive performance were assessed sequentially in four different conditions- baseline (without stressors), 85 dB(A) noise, 14,000 ft altitude and 85 dB(A) noise with 14,000 ft altitude exposure concurrently. The experiment was conducted in hypoxia chamber for altitude simulation and white noise was generated through software. Cognitive performance was assessed with three tests from Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) test battery. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA. Tukey HSD post hoc test was carried out to determine pair wise significance for direct and interaction effect.Results:There was significant decrement of implicit association reaction time with direct effects of both 85 dB(A) white noise (F= 7.944, p= 0.008601) and 14,000 ft altitude (F= 14.665, p= 0.000634). Post hoc analysis also showed significant interaction effects of dual stressors on it. There were no significant effects of the same dual stressors on visuospatial working memory and selective attention when applied independently as well as concurrently. Decreased SpO2 due to altitude exposure as well as increased heart rate in both noise and altitude exposure were the normal autonomic and neuro-hormonal responses of human body. Other physiological parameters viz. SBP, DBP, MAP, PP were not affected by the dual stressors.Conclusion:Optimal cognitive function is utmost necessary while carrying out aviation tasks, any significant amount of deterioration in this aspect is of aeromedical significance. Impaired implicit reaction time in this study hints at increased risk taking behaviour in the presence of dual stressors viz., hypoxia and noise by their direct effect as well as interaction effect. Hence, this issues should be stressed upon during pilot training to enhance flight safety and mission accomplishment.","Background and Introduction:Cognitive performance issues in pilots are pervasive in nature and have important safety implications.

516,2020,The American Journal of Psychology,Parallel Development of James J. Gibson’s Ecological and Paul M. Fitts’s Information Processing Approaches to Perception and Performance,"James J. Gibson and Paul M. Fitts, two psychologists who had, and continue to have, a substantial influence on research in perception, action, and human performance, had remarkable, parallel careers with roots in the U.S. Army Air Forces Aviation Psychology program in World War II. Fitts is widely regarded as founder of the applied field of engineering psychology and the basic field of human performance, both based on a human information processing approach. Gibson founded ecological psychology, a school of thought that runs counter to the information processing approach and adopts a radical empiricist approach to perception and action in natural environments. Despite the origins of their disparate views in applied aviation psychology and each having had major impacts on the field of psychology, Gibson and Fitts seem to have had little contact with each other, and their research traditions have continued primarily along separate paths to this day. In this article, we review the arcs of Fitts’s and Gibson’s careers, emphasizing similarities and differences historically and theoretically. We end with a discussion of why their approaches differed widely, whether attempts to reconcile them can be meaningful, and the importance of experimental psychologists attending to applied research problems.","James J.

517,2005,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Implementation and assessment of a new integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of a safety intervention in a complex socio-technological workplace,"The rate of injury and death inadvertently caused by medical treatment is too high and exacts enormous human and financial costs. Each year in Britain and the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of patients are injured, ten of thousands are killed and billions of dollars are spent on additional health care due to iatrogenic harm. Health care organisations remain predominately human-centred in their approach to safety—that is, methods of avoiding error rely primarily on the resolve and vigilance of individual clinicians to avoid bad outcomes. However, this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate in the face of the steadily rising complexity of modern health care and the increasing number of procedures carried out each year. In other high-reliability organisations such as aviation and nuclear power generation, safety results not from the sheer effort of “operators”, but from in-depth analysis of problems and the removal and redesign of dangerous aspects of systems—the so-called systems approach. Here I present an evaluation of the integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of the systems approach, intended to reorganise the way in which anaesthetists give drugs to improve performance and facilitate safe practice. The problem of drug error in anaesthesia is an important subset of iatrogenic harm in medicine. From the prospective study of 10806 conventional anaesthetics I define the rate of drug error in anaesthesia as one error in every 133 anaesthetics conducted—a rate five times higher than anything previously reported. In addition, anaesthetists rated the risk of harming a patient through drug error in the course of their career as high. I discuss the principles of safe system design, the psychology of error, and advanced systems safety concepts with respect to the design of the IDAS and the future of safety in medicine. In clinical use, the IDAS saved time before and during anaesthesia, and was rated by anaesthetists as significantly safer and more useable than conventional methods of drug administration. This work supports the hypothesis that error in anaesthesia can be reduced through the systematic analysis of its causes and the implementation of appropriate countermeasure strategies.","The rate of injury and death inadvertently caused by medical treatment is too high and exacts enormous human and financial costs.

Based on gender congruence theory, we hypothesized that daughters’ well-being would be more adversely impacted by their mothers’ helicopter parenting compared to fathers’, while the opposite pattern would emerge for sons.MethodParticipants were 446 college students between 18–25 years old who completed an online survey. The majority of participants were white, female, underclassman from middle to upper-middle class families.ResultsParticipants reported that their mothers engaged in more helicopter parenting than their fathers. Male and female participants did not differ in the amount of helicopter parenting they experienced, so we tested a model combining these sub-samples. Two minor differences were identified: Daughters reported maternal helicopter parenting was more strongly associated with decreased autonomy and sons reported paternal helicopter parenting was more strongly associated with a decreased relatedness. Thus, a partial equivalence model was tested with only these two paths free to vary between groups. Maternal helicopter parenting was indirectly associated with their children’s reduced well-being on all three measures (i.e., anxiety, depression, and satisfaction with life) through a reduced sense of autonomy and competence. Paternal helicopter parenting was only indirectly associated with their offspring’s well-being through autonomy.ConclusionsResults supported prior research suggesting helicopter parenting adversely affects emerging adults’ well-being through its negative impact on the basic psychological needs of self-determination. There was limited support for gender differences in the impact of helicopter parenting on emerging adults.","ObjectivesWe examined gender differences in helicopter parenting and emerging adults’ well-being through the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

To document the extent to which this ‘co-piloting’ currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance. Overall, the probability that a given p-value was inconsistent was over 10%. Co-piloting was not found to be associated with reporting errors.","Statistical analysis is error prone.

522,2013,Science and Engineering Ethics,Introducing Survival Ethics into Engineering Education and Practice,"Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life. This crisis calls for an ethics that furnishes effective motives to take global action necessary for survival. We propose a research program for understanding why ethical principles change across time and culture. We also propose provisional motives and methods for reaching global consensus on engineering field ethics. Current interdisciplinary research in ethics, psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary theory grounds these proposals. Experimental ethics, the application of scientific principles to ethical studies, provides a model for developing policies to advance solutions. A growing literature proposes evolutionary explanations for moral development. Connecting these approaches necessitates an experimental or scientific ethics that deliberately examines theories of morality for reliability. To illustrate how such an approach works, we cover three areas. The first section analyzes cross-cultural ethical systems in light of evolutionary theory. While such research is in its early stages, its assumptions entail consequences for engineering education. The second section discusses Howard University and University of Puerto Rico/Mayagüez (UPRM) courses that bring ethicists together with scientists and engineers to unite ethical theory and practice. We include a syllabus for engineering and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) ethics courses and a checklist model for translating educational theory and practice into community action. The model is based on aviation, medicine and engineering practice. The third and concluding section illustrates Howard University and UPRM efforts to translate engineering educational theory into community action. Multidisciplinary teams of engineering students and instructors take their expertise from the classroom to global communities to examine further the ethicality of prospective technologies and the decision-making processes that lead to them.","Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life.

We utilized a self-determination theoretical framework to replicate and expand current research regarding the impact of helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting on emerging adult mental and physical well-being. Further, we examined self-efficacy as a mechanism for helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting to impact well-being, using structural equation modeling with a sample of 461 emerging adult college students from a large southeastern, United States university. The two-factor structure of the Helicopter Parenting Behaviors measure was confirmed, indicating helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting are two unique, but related, constructs. Both autonomy supportive parenting and helicopter parenting were found to have indirect effects on anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, and physical health through self-efficacy. Results also indicated autonomy supportive parenting was directly related to life satisfaction and physical health when accounting for self-efficacy, whereas helicopter parenting was not directly related to well-being. This study adds to the extant literature by its' application of a family-level lens to the self-determination theory, its' advancement of parenting behaviors measurement, and its' exploration of the continued influence of parenting during emerging adulthood.","Helicopter parenting has become an increasing concern among practitioners, college administrators, and professors.

The query method involves an embedded guided, sentence generation task requiring elaboration of key concepts in the training material that encourages learners to 'stop and think' about the information already presented before proceeding to new concepts. This study also investigated the effect of varying the level of elaboration (low or high) prompted by the queries. Fifty-one undergraduate students from the general psychology department subject pool at a major university in the southeastern United States received instruction on the basic principles of flight via one of three versions of a computer-based tutorial (no query, low-level elaboration query, or high-level elaboration query). Participants had no prior knowledge or previous experience with the aviation domain. A one-way between-groups design was employed, with the query method serving as the independent variable and a sample size of 17 per condition. Dependent variables included knowledge organization, knowledge acquisition, and instructional efficiency. Overall, results showed that incorporating low-level elaboration queries into the training resulted in improved organization, integration, and application of task-relevant knowledge and higher instructional efficiency. High-level elaboration queries consistently failed to produce significantly better post-training outcomes, possibly due to the increased cognitive load imposed on learners during training. The discussion centers on theoretical and practical implications for promoting and assessing learning outcomes in computer-based training.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","The present study investigated the utility of an instructional strategy known as the query method for enhancing learning outcomes in computer-based training.

533,2024,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Functional Dyspepsia and Tricyclic Antidepressant Use in a Naval Flight Officer,"BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia is a disorder of gut–brain interaction that has the potential to impact aviation performance. Proton pump inhibitors are well-tolerated but are only effective in one half of cases. Second-line treatments, including tricyclic antidepressants, are associated with drowsiness and are not routinely approved for use in aviators. We present a case of a Naval Flight Officer with functional dyspepsia who was successfully treated with amitriptyline and returned to flying status.CASE REPORT: A 23-yr-old male Naval Flight Officer presented with postprandial fullness and epigastric pain. His symptoms were refractory to trials of acid suppression and lifestyle modification. An extensive evaluation by Gastroenterology, including upper endoscopy, did not reveal an organic cause of his symptoms and he was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. The patient’s symptoms resolved with a trial of amitriptyline. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no medication effect on cognitive performance. A waiver to resume flying duties on amitriptyline was submitted to the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute and was approved.DISCUSSION: We present the second known waiver issued in U.S. Naval aviation history for the use of amitriptyline to treat a gastrointestinal disorder. Amitriptyline is not commonly waived due to the potential for unacceptable cognitive side-effects in the flight environment. However, neuropsychological testing to assess for a possible medication effect on performance can be used to inform an aeromedical disposition and, in this case, allowed for a return to flight status.Crutcher R, Kolasinski N.

Drawing on literature from industrial/organizational, sport, and military psychology, the current research specified one nomological network for officer team leadership appraisal. The proposed model tested the idea that Naval team leaders engaging in transformational behaviors would be more likely to use and encourage the use of teamwork processes, increase cohesion among team members, and maintain superior mission readiness. The hypotheses were tested with performance appraisal data from 900 Commanders, Lieutenant Commanders, and Lieutenants from aviation, surface, and subsurface warfare communities. The relationships between the constructs were tested using path analysis. Multiple-group comparisons were conducted to identify differences in modeled relationships across the warfare communities. Results did not provide support to the argument that team leadership is more accurately defined and measured as a series of interrelated constructs. Discussion centered on the implications of the results for assessing team leadership.","This study examined the construct-related validity evidence for team leadership measurement within the United States Navy.

This study evaluated whether electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback enhances muscle activation patterns during AGSM training in novice cadets.INTRODUCTIONEffective execution of the anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) is essential for pilots to maintain consciousness under high gravitational forces (+Gz). This study evaluated whether electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback enhances muscle activation patterns during AGSM training in novice cadets.There were 58 Brazilian Air Force cadets (age: 25 ± 1 yr) who performed two AGSM sessions involving sustained submaximal isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, and rectus abdominis muscles, synchronized with rhythmic breathing every 3 s. Subjects completed trials under counterbalanced visual EMG feedback conditions (real-time visualization vs. no visualization) and were randomly assigned to verbal feedback conditions (instructor guidance vs. no guidance). EMG signals were recorded at 1500 Hz and normalized to each subject's peak amplitude during the AGSM trials.METHODSThere were 58 Brazilian Air Force cadets (age: 25 ± 1 yr) who performed two AGSM sessions involving sustained submaximal isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, and rectus abdominis muscles, synchronized with rhythmic breathing every 3 s.

EMG signals were recorded at 1500 Hz and normalized to each subject's peak amplitude during the AGSM trials.Muscle-specific responses to feedback were observed. Verbal feedback enhanced gastrocnemius activation but reduced vastus medialis activation. Combined visual and verbal feedback produced the highest activation in the rectus abdominis. Visual feedback alone had minimal effect across all muscles. Despite submaximal instructions, brief peak activations were sufficient for normalization.RESULTSMuscle-specific responses to feedback were observed.

Visual feedback alone had minimal effect across all muscles. Despite submaximal instructions, brief peak activations were sufficient for normalization.EMG biofeedback facilitated motor learning of AGSM by selectively improving activation in targeted muscles. However, effects varied by muscle group, suggesting the need for tailored instructional strategies.

537,2025,"Cognition, Technology & Work",Startle and surprise in helicopter operations: reported prevalence and application of mitigation strategies,"Startle and surprise can impair pilot performance and affect flight safety. This study investigates the prevalence of different startle and surprise events among helicopter pilots, its impact on pilot stress and mental effort and the influence of training background. It also looks at currently used startle mitigation strategies and evaluates the usability of a previously proposed “Aviate, Breathe, Check (ABC)” startle management method (Piras et al. 2023). A survey among 234 helicopter pilots revealed that 96% had experienced impactful startle or surprise events during operations. Scenarios such as disorientation, tail rotor incidents, and flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) were considered particularly stressful. Reported levels of stress and mental effort during startle and surprise events did not differ between pilots with higher and lower experience levels or between pilots with a different training background (military or civilian). Only 38% of pilots indicated they were specifically trained to deal with startle and surprise and only 1% were trained to use a breathing technique. Most pilots (90%) expressed openness to implementing the ABC method and expected benefits from using it. Concerns regarding time constraints in critical situations emerged as the primary objection to adopting this technique. Overall, the findings indicate that the introduction of a startle management method tailored for helicopter operations could significantly enhance safety, especially given the higher accident rates compared to fixed-wing operations. Future research should focus on developing effective training protocols that account for the unique challenges of helicopter flying.Highlights96% percent of helicopter pilots have experienced impactful startle and/or surprise in flight.Although 59,3% stated using a startle management method or strategy, only 1% of helicopter pilots use a breathing-based startle management method.No statistical difference in experienced stress or mental effort between military and civilian training background, and for different experience levels.90% of helicopter pilots are open to using a startle management method such as the ABC method (Piras, 2023).A properly trained startle management technique could potentially have safety benefits for helicopter pilots.","Startle and surprise can impair pilot performance and affect flight safety.

538,2013,Science and Engineering Ethics,Introducing Survival Ethics into Engineering Education and Practice,"Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life. This crisis calls for an ethics that furnishes effective motives to take global action necessary for survival. We propose a research program for understanding why ethical principles change across time and culture. We also propose provisional motives and methods for reaching global consensus on engineering field ethics. Current interdisciplinary research in ethics, psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary theory grounds these proposals. Experimental ethics, the application of scientific principles to ethical studies, provides a model for developing policies to advance solutions. A growing literature proposes evolutionary explanations for moral development. Connecting these approaches necessitates an experimental or scientific ethics that deliberately examines theories of morality for reliability. To illustrate how such an approach works, we cover three areas. The first section analyzes cross-cultural ethical systems in light of evolutionary theory. While such research is in its early stages, its assumptions entail consequences for engineering education. The second section discusses Howard University and University of Puerto Rico/Mayagüez (UPRM) courses that bring ethicists together with scientists and engineers to unite ethical theory and practice. We include a syllabus for engineering and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) ethics courses and a checklist model for translating educational theory and practice into community action. The model is based on aviation, medicine and engineering practice. The third and concluding section illustrates Howard University and UPRM efforts to translate engineering educational theory into community action. Multidisciplinary teams of engineering students and instructors take their expertise from the classroom to global communities to examine further the ethicality of prospective technologies and the decision-making processes that lead to them.","Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life.

540,2020,Journal of Tourism and Leisure Studies,A Typology of Delinquent Behavior on the Aircraft,"Airplane delinquency is known to both professionals and passengers. However, the particularity of the airplane as an enclosed space where one cannot leave when and whenever they wish, the intense phobias associated with this space and the competition between companies operating in the field often prevents the wide publicity of the delinquent incidents that take place inside the plane. This study seeks to record and classify the incidents of delinquency occurring in the international arena by investigating similar incidents and studying relevant cases. The data are derived from interviews of people who have been working for years as flight attendants on airplanes managing similar incidents as well as recording, classifying, and studying incidents as reported by the international media. The results show the occurrence of all kinds of airplane delinquency, such as drunkenness, theft, drug abuse, obscene behavior, domestic violence, etc. occurring among all persons on board (passengers, crew members). Due to the lack of systematic aircraft surveys concerning the incidents of delinquent behavior and ways of managing them, in conjunction with the airline, the type of clientele, the seasonality, etc. it is suggested that targeted research should be carried out involving scientists from the fields of social, legal sciences, administration, and psychology so that there is a complete image of the problem and ways of dealing with it.","Airplane delinquency is known to both professionals and passengers.

545,2016,Career Planning and Adult Development Journal,MENTAL HEALTH or CAREER COUNSELING: A Forced Choice?

These workers used their personal and career adaptability to find new employment, move households, and re-establish support systems. The relationship between mental health and career counseling is not new. Betz and Corning (1993) argued that the division between career and personal counseling is in conflict with the overall philosophical position of the counseling profession. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the importance of conceptualizing career counseling as a process for mental health and optimal human functioning. A definition of optimal human functioning is offered as a framework for supporting individual human strengths. Then, by reviewing emerging literature that highlights relationships between career adaptability and markers of positive mental health, the authors advance the perspective that career counseling affects the whole person. Finally, they describe ways of incorporating the various dimensions and aspects of optimal human functioning and career adaptability into the practice of career counseling.","In 2011, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ended the US shuttle program and approximately 3500 workers found their jobs gone.

547,2025,Journal of Organization Design,Déjà vu all over again: what the past can teach us about the future,"The paper, titled ""Déjà vu All Over Again: What the Past Can Teach Us About the Future"" by William Mateer, Paul Tolchinsky, PhD, and Peter Turgoose, explores the contemporary challenges faced by today’s organizations as they respond to the increasing turbulence in the world. The authors advocate for a response capability that is rooted in the foundational principles that make each organization successful yet unique, applying the lessons that the past can teach us about the future. The paper draws inspiration from three seminal books published in the late 1970s and early 1980s, reflecting on the enduring relevance of their insights in the present. The authors focus on Classics in Organization Behavior, Classics in Organization Theory, and Classics of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. The central narrative centers around the case study of GE Aviation (formerly GE Aircraft Engines) facility in Bromont, Quebec, Canada, a maverick organization which has thrived for over 40 years as a self-organizing workplace. The socio-technical perspective applied at Bromont originated from the work at the Tavistock Institute in the 1950s, challenging the prevailing technological imperative in favor of a more holistic approach that considers people as integral to the system, rather than expendable spare parts. The paper details Bromont's evolution, success factors, and challenges, emphasizing the importance of continuous adaptation, employee involvement, and a flat organizational structure. The authors derive key lessons from Bromont, including the significance of leadership support, rigorous hiring processes, the benefits of smaller organizational sizes, the role of managers as enablers, and the need for a unique, contextualized approach rather than blindly copying models. The paper concludes by advocating for the ongoing optimization of socio-technical systems, aligning growth and learning within a flat organizational structure, and maintaining a balance between new business strategies and foundational principles.","The paper, titled ""Déjà vu All Over Again: What the Past Can Teach Us About the Future"" by William Mateer, Paul Tolchinsky, PhD, and Peter Turgoose, explores the contemporary challenges faced by today’s organizations as they respond to the increasing turbulence in the world.

557,2009,Advances in Cognitive Psychology,"Designing informative warning signals: Efects of indicator type, modality, and task demand on recognition speed and accuracy","An experiment investigated the assumption that natural indicators which exploit existing learned associations between a signal and an event make more effective warnings than previously unlearned symbolic indicators. Signal modality (visual, auditory) and task demand (low, high) were also manipulated. Warning effectiveness was indexed by accuracy and reaction time (RT) recorded during training and dual task test phases. Thirty-six participants were trained to recognize 4 natural and 4 symbolic indicators, either visual or auditory, paired with critical incidents from an aviation context. As hypothesized, accuracy was greater and RT was faster in response to natural indicators during the training phase. This pattern of responding was upheld in test phase conditions with respect to accuracy but observed in RT only in test phase conditions involving high demand and the auditory modality. Using the experiment as a specific example, we argue for the importance of considering the cognitive contribution of the user (viz., prior learned associations) in the warning design process. Drawing on semiotics and cognitive psychology, we highlight the indexical nature of so-called auditory icons or natural indicators and argue that the cogniser is an indispensable element in the tripartite nature of signification.","An experiment investigated the assumption that natural indicators which exploit existing learned associations between a signal and an event make more effective warnings than previously unlearned symbolic indicators.

562,2020,Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology,A Mixed Method Investigation of Past Trainees’ Perceptions of a Critical Incident Situational Awareness Training Program,"In the arena of skills training for acting in complex, high-stress environments, situation awareness has been identified as a key characteristic of successful operators. The definition of situation awareness has evolved over time to include psychophysiological state management, stress inoculation, and cognitive components. This paper utilizes a mixed methods design to examine a training program, which claims to combine the aforementioned situation awareness components in protocols developed for military, law enforcement, and private security personnel. Four past participants of the training program completed in-depth, semi-structured interviews about their experience with the training. Subsequently, a training-specific survey was developed to more thoroughly investigate trainees’ experiences. Survey responses of the program’s trainees (n = 32) were compared to non-program trainees from similar fields (n = 35) on quantitative measures. Open-ended responses of the program’s trainees were qualitatively analyzed. Overall, program trainees were found to perceive the training as positively impacting their situation awareness ability in stressful/threatening situations and non-stressful situations compared to the non-program trainees. Qualitative analyses conducted with the interviews and on open-response survey items provide descriptive explanations for how the training program is perceived to be influencing situation awareness abilities.","In the arena of skills training for acting in complex, high-stress environments, situation awareness has been identified as a key characteristic of successful operators.

However, parental overinvolvement may have negative consequences on development. This study examined the role of helicopter parenting and its effects on anxiety, depression, self-efficacy and adjustment to college among 294 college students. It was hypothesized that students with parents who are overly controlling will have higher levels of anxiety and depression and lower levels of self-efficacy, leading to poorer college adjustment, as evidenced by grade point average, academic adjustment, and social adjustment to college. The structural model was generally supported by the data, indicating an indirect effect of helicopter parenting on college adjustment, thus confirming the importance of the relationship between healthy parenting and college student mental health and, subsequently, student success. The study also examined student preferences for parental intervention, finding that students reporting more overparenting were less likely to desire parental intervention.","As the entry into adulthood has become delayed, parental involvement in young adults’ lives has increased.

566,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,The effect of conative and affective traits on the development of occupational expertise of civilian Department of Defense scientists and engineers,"One of the roles of an engineering manager is to manage and develop expertise within the workforce. To this end, effective knowledge worker management requires insight into psychology and how it relates to the development of expertise. Modern psychology theory identifies three modes of mental function: cognition, affect, and conation. This research examines the role of affect and conation in the development of expertise. Expert theorists have assembled a strong body of evidence which suggests that superior achievement depends on adaptation resulting from sustained purposeful engagement. A substantial amount of research is devoted to the role of cognition in enabling expert performance. However, conation and affect are also hypothesized to be influential factors, as they determine the motivation and approach of the individual towards continuous development. A survey instrument was compiled, consisting of a set of conative and affective traits hypothesized to influence expertise development and a construct representing expertise. The survey was distributed within a large, federally-funded research and development laboratory which operates in the aviation and aerospace industry, producing a total of 541 responses. The structural equation modeling (SEM) statistical method was utilized to model and analyze the relationship between conative and affective traits and the development of occupational expertise.The findings of this research support the hypothesis that conative and affective traits are influential during expertise development. The dissertation results indicate that positive achievement orientation holds a strong, positive influence on expertise development. The mastery goal type coupled with the approach goal posture is the only goal orientation which positively influences expertise development. Work engagement holds a positive influence on expertise development. Expertise theorists hypothesize that expert-level technical performance is achievable for any individual with normal cognitive ability. Unfortunately, the reality is that only a small segment of knowledge workers currently approach this performance threshold. If engineering managers can access even a fraction of the remaining untapped potential, the implications for society are tremendous. By understanding the role of conative and affective traits in expertise development, managers can enhance professional development infrastructure and training methods in order to better support expertise development.","One of the roles of an engineering manager is to manage and develop expertise within the workforce.

573,2004,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Develop a model flight safety program for small air carriers and operators,"The U.S. aviation industry is composed of thousands of aircraft operators. While the few, major air carriers are large companies, with well-developed management resources, the majority of carriers and corporate flight operating departments exist with the minimum management staffs allowable under the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For operators of large aircraft, or operators of medium-size aircraft in scheduled service, the FAA has, since 1994, required the position of Director of Safety. Smaller aircraft operators are not required to have a safety department. With small management staffs and the lack of a regulatory requirement, most of these operators exist without the benefit of a formal safety program. This project seeks to supplement the attributes of commonly observed airline safety programs with research in the fields of safety, education, psychology, and law to formulate safety sub-programs which are usable by small operators with minimal staffing. Then an internet-based system is established for the population of carriers, and the carriers are provided with a continuous flow of safety program management, similar to that provided by the safety staff of carriers with safety offices. After an introductory period of program operation, the users are sampled regarding the perceived usefulness of the various program elements. The program is modified to improve usefulness, and the users are polled again. Data from on-site audits of various carriers with and without safety programs is analyzed to match the overall operations and maintenance management strength with the degree of maturity of the carrier's safety program. The objective is to show that safety program management can be extended economically to the smaller carriers who would ordinarily not participate in such a program, to determine the usability of such a system, and to estimate whether the effectiveness of the safety program is related with overall performance. If successful, this model could provide the template for a nationwide, or even worldwide system of safety program management, elevating the level of safety awareness, training, and performance for the largest segment of the aviation industry. The model could also apply to other industries with a large number of small, fragmented safety-sensitive operators.","The U.S. aviation industry is composed of thousands of aircraft operators.

577,2025,Cognitive science,The Sustained Attention Paradox: A Critical Commentary on the Theoretical Impossibility of Perfect Vigilance,"The human capacity for sustained attention represents a critical cognitive paradox: while essential for numerous high-stakes tasks, perfect vigilance is fundamentally impossible. This commentary explores the theoretical impossibility of maintaining uninterrupted attention, drawing from extensive interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology. Multiple converging lines of evidence demonstrate that sustained attention is constrained by neural, biological, and cognitive limitations. Neural mechanisms reveal that attention operates through rhythmic oscillations, with inherent fluctuations in frontoparietal networks and default mode network interactions. Neurochemical systems and cellular adaptation effects further underscore the impossibility of continuous, perfect vigilance. Empirical research across domains-including aviation, healthcare, industrial safety, and security-consistently demonstrates rapid declines in attention performance over time, regardless of individual expertise or motivation. Even elite performers like military personnel and experienced meditators exhibit inevitable attention lapses. This paper presents an argument against traditional approaches that seek to overcome these limitations through training or willpower. Instead, it advocates for designing human-technology systems that work harmoniously with cognitive constraints. This requires developing adaptive automation, understanding individual and cultural attention variations, and creating frameworks that strategically balance human capabilities with technological support.The human capacity for sustained attention represents a critical cognitive paradox: while essential for numerous high-stakes tasks, perfect vigilance is fundamentally impossible.

581,2011,Journal of Engineering Education,Using Paper-and-Pencil Solutions to Assess Problem Solving Skill,"Problem solving practice involving paper-and-pencil solutions is a common activity in undergraduate engineering training. This paper addresses three questions: What indicators of problem-solving skill are available in paper-and-pencil solutions, beyond a simple accuracy measure? Can these indicators distinguish between problem solvers in terms of their skill level? How can these indicators be used to improve the effectiveness of instructor feedback to problem-solving exercises? Based on the published literature on cognition and problem solving, several indicators were hypothesized to signal knowledge and skill: an accurate free-body diagram, specification of assumptions, accurate expansion of key principles, strategic (forward) inferences, and checking equations and solutions. A mixed experimental methodology was applied that combined qualitative and quantitative analyses. The qualitative data was comprised of paper-and-pencil solutions and video recordings of participants while they solved problems. Frequency counts of skill indicators and grader-assigned scores comprised the quantitative data. Statistical tests confirmed that the hypothesized indicators were associated with individuals' level of skill. However, reliable evidence for these indicators was only partially found in the paper-and-pencil solutions and could only be firmly established by including data from the video recordings. The results show that paper-and-pencil solutions can be diagnostic of the strengths and weaknesses of problem-solvers. However, to provide useful and reliable feedback to students, these solutions must be supplemented with additional input, possibly through regular structured sampling throughout a course, or through more extensive use of computer resources.","Problem solving practice involving paper-and-pencil solutions is a common activity in undergraduate engineering training. This paper addresses three questions: What indicators of problem-solving skill are available in paper-and-pencil solutions, beyond a simple accuracy measure?

582,2005,PQDT - UK & Ireland,Christopher caudwell : a critical evaluation,"I aim to demonstrate that, while Caudwell had certain failings such as an occasional ultra-leftism, his works possess a relevance not only to his own era – the 1930s – but also to our own time. Indeed it might well be argued that, given the situation in the world at the beginning of the 21st century, his works are as worthy of attention as they ever were. I shall also demonstrate that his works and reputation were dealt a near-death blow in the early 1950s due, in good part, to Cold War politics and the cultural assault promulgated by the USSR under the auspices of A.A. Zhdanov in the latter’s attack on Bourgeois culture in 1984 combined with the Soviet Union’s official acceptance of Lysenkoism as the model of biological science.Caudwell wrote on a wide range of subjects in his short life, including physics, literature (in particular poetry) psychology, economics and politics. It should be noted that, with regard to the last, there is very little in the way of direct political commentary in any of Caudwell’s works and this may be a reason for the accusations of non-Marxist or politically heterodox thinking from a wide range of critics, both of the left and of the right. In this thesis I have concentrated on certain aspects of Caudwell’s work. Restrictions of length have forced me to leave some of Caudwell’s works virtually untouched, mainly his novels, published and unpublished; his works on engineering and aviation have also been omitted for this reason, although these works do bear witness to Caudwell’s enthusiasm for all things new.Therefore this thesis is an appraisal of Caudwell as a committed revolutionary thinker, a Marxist aesthetician and a scientifically-oriented dialectical materialist; a man deeply influenced by the great theorists of Marxism, especially Engels and Lenin, but also Freud, Jung and Jane Harrison and F.M. Cornford of the ‘Cambridge School’ of Anthropology and others not within the Marxist canon, giving strength to his exploration into the human condition and his quest for a unified Weltanshauung.","I aim to demonstrate that, while Caudwell had certain failings such as an occasional ultra-leftism, his works possess a relevance not only to his own era – the 1930s – but also to our own time.

583,2019,PQDT - UK & Ireland,The Pathless Sky : Violence and Culture in First World War Air Services,"The First World War has almost always been the impetus behind new developments in critical studies of violence, in fields as diverse as psychology, strategic studies, and cultural history. Western Front infantry soldiers remain central to cross-disciplinary interpretations of combatant experience, identity, and community. This thesis reframes these fundamental relationships between war violence and community by considering an under-explored First World War battlefield: the air. It explores French, British, and American fighter pilots as a transnational combat culture emerging in dialogue with a distinctive, new type of warfare. Though still largely relegated to popular history and one-dimensional stereotypes, First World War flyers vividly expose the wartime processes of navigating 'unprecedented' violence. Air services began the war affiliated with older military services and without a clear picture of what an aerial conflict entailed. As such, pilots themselves were disproportionately important to shaping the practices, rules, language, and uses of military aviation. The thesis follows fighter pilots through the process of learning to fly into informally organised combat, establishing their under-explored reliance on peacetime transnational aviation networks and elite flying 'aces' to share information and create communal practices. Pilots who flew in the three-dimensional battle space above the Western Front relied upon complex embodied relationships with their rapidly militarising aircraft to survive, a process that directly informed the ways in which they did, suffered, and survived aerial violence. The thesis explores the impact of these shared experiences, demonstrating First World War aerial violence's profound disruption of military and class hierarchies and its post-war commodification as a cultural tool. Allied aviators' transnational combat culture was shaped by what this thesis terms 'violent flight', or the embodied experience of flying in a dangerous combat zone. As pilots considered this to be work, the thesis establishes a materially informed, geographically specific interpretation of pilots as gendered labourers to elucidate the development of their wartime communities into a unified combat culture. This deliberately transnational, multi-disciplinary approach urges new, post-centenary conversations about the place of violence in First World War historiography and establishes a specific, complex symbiosis between violence and war cultures.","The First World War has almost always been the impetus behind new developments in critical studies of violence, in fields as diverse as psychology, strategic studies, and cultural history.

I also observed that those officers who performed well reminded me of successful athletes while those police officers who performed poorly exhibited characteristics of unsuccessful athletes. Because Olympic and professional athletes are always pushing the limit and trying to increase their peak performance in competition, I thought some of their training techniques, particularly the psychological ones, would have transferability to police work.I searched the literature of both Russian and American sports psychology, as well as that of the Japanese martial arts. This search was done for those techniques from these sources that might be used as training techniques by police officers to facilitate peak performance in crisis situations.Several factors were extracted from each. A slide presentation was developed to teach these factors, and a trial course was created to explore the effect of using these techniques in a classroom setting.The slide presentation was then presented to the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) Skymarshalls at the FAA base in Los Angeles, a Conference for the Emergency Care Workers of South Central Minnesota which was sponsored by the Medical Emergency Joint Powers Board, and the Bloomington Rescue Squad in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A very favourable reception was received at each presentation.I believe the slide presentation and lecture are now ready for marketing as an in-service training program for police officers and others whose work involves peak performance in crisis situations.","Initially, I observed that police officers in general were not well trained for, nor functioned well, in crisis situations.

589,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,A Novel Approach for AI Based Driver Behavior Analysis Model Using Visual and Cognitive Data,"In recent years there has been increasing research on incorporating intelligent driver assistance systems (IDAS) into vehicular platforms to help drivers make better driving decisions and to make the roadways safer. The percentage of highway accidents in United States is steadily increasing every year. Current IDAS such as collision detection and avoidance systems use models of human behavior to improve the reliability of these systems and to help decrease driver workload. Modeling driver behavior is not a simple task. It involves aspects of psychology, physiology, data analysis, signal processing and engineering, to name a few. In the case of lane changing events, early detection of a driver’s intent to change lanes can be beneficial to systems that involve vehicle- to- vehicle communications. Moreover, a lane change prediction system, could be integrated into automatic aviation of the turn signal. Most published studies of lane change events are based on large scale vehicle trajectory data i.e steering angle, velocity and accelerations. Using this approach, a lane change prediction event is typically detected as soon as the driver initiates a lane change maneuver. Most vehicular trajectory model fails when a driver forgets to enable a turn signal before making a lane change. Hence, irrespective of having many automatic features equipped in modern day cars, the accident rate is still not decreasing.  In such cases, biomedical signals may play an important role in detecting early driver intention. Besides vehicle dynamics (lane change, braking, acceleration), it is also important to understand the mental workload of the driver to maintain safety while travelling. Mental workload is directly related to distracted or non- distracted driving which varies with emotional changes. The mental workload can tremendously impact driving behavior and hence the detection of these factors will add driver safety on roadway.In this dissertation, we propose to utilize visual and cognitive information to detect a driver’s intent to change lanes and predict their mental distraction. Mental workload varies in different situations. For example, the amount of focus required during a lane change maneuver can be disrupted due to a secondary task like cell phone usage, talking to a co-passenger, a baby crying in the back seat or an unexpected news broadcasted on the car radio. Most of the research focuses on distracted driving using a cell phone, although more number of accidents are accounted on highways during talking to passengers.  In this research, conversational task with co –passengers are considered as a situation, for intent analysis and cognitive workload analysis of the driver.  A novel approach is developed that considers eye movements and cognitive attentiveness as distraction levels are increased during two different scenarios (i) single passenger driving and (ii) driving with passengers.  This involves aspects of statistical analysis, signal processing, software engineering and machine learning techniques. Different types of statistical analysis techniques like normalization, correlation models are used in this research. Software development with TCL scripting is utilized to design real time virtual scenario for data collection. Signal Processing techniques like power spectral analysis, cognitive engagement ratio etc. are utilized to analyze brain signals. Artificial Intelligence methods are applied to help make accurate predictions of driver intent. Finally, Artificial Intelligence is a broad field that uses deep learning and machine learning algorithms to mimic human cognition. This research utilizes innovative machine learning tools like sklearn and tensor flow, to automate the process of behavior analysis.This work will inform research on lane-change prediction, behavior prediction and vehicular feedback analysis using an IDAS environment. Furthermore, this work considers factors that may impact the lane change detection and prediction of differential drivers including elderly drivers. This work also contributes an individual database that records driving behaviors during conversational tasks that other researchers can use to conduct behavior analysis research associated with this driving scenario. To author’s knowledge this is the first database that will be made available publicly for use in conversational task scenario in driving.This dissertation is composed of five chapters. Chapter 1 presents the introduction and back ground of IDAS research. It highlights various factors that contribute to detrimental road crashes and describes the research gap in this field. Chapter 2 includes a detailed literature review of all the studies that has been conducted in this field and also includes essential biological and artificial intelligence methods that are important to know in order this field. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology that has been adopted in this project. It includes description of virtual reality development procedure for collecting data from driver simulator, data collection procedure for various parameter in this research and also describes the mathematical models of each concept. Chapter 4 consists of results, discussion and the importance of novel distraction recognition algorithm. Finally, conclusion, limitations and future work are discussed in chapter 5.",In recent years there has been increasing research on incorporating intelligent driver assistance systems (IDAS) into vehicular platforms to help drivers make better driving decisions and to make the roadways safer.

596,2018,PQDT - UK & Ireland,Team Effectiveness in Professional Cricket,"To produce superior team performances members must be able to work well together to exceed the sum of their parts. Despite an extensive body of research in healthcare, business, military, and aviation, there is limited understanding of what effective teams do in sport. In an attempt to address this gap in the literature the present doctoral thesis – commissioned by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - sought to uncover, measure, test, and improve the most important factors for team effectiveness in cricket. The thesis contains three empirical studies which address the following research questions: (i) what factors contribute to the effectiveness of cricket teams? (ii) How can team functioning and effectiveness be measured? (iii) Can factors of team functioning accurately predict effective cricket teams, and what is the relative importance of those factors? (iv) Can team functioning and effectiveness be improved in cricket teams? Chapter 1 of the thesis defines some of the key terms associated with the group-based literature, before critically reviewing the organisational and sport psychology literature on team effectiveness and group dynamics, highlighting limitations that need to be addressed. These include a lack of research attention on teamwork or team functioning in sport, the investigation of group-related variables in sport in isolation, an overreliance on deductive approaches to framework development, a lack of appropriate measures, and the exclusive focus upon the development of cohesion within team building interventions in sport. Chapter 2 is an abductive, qualitative investigation involving 21 cricket experts, which explores the factors most important for team effectiveness in cricket. Based on this elite samples’ construal, we propose a parsimonious and novel conceptualisation of team effectiveness in cricket (Essential Team Ingredients model; ETI). Chapter 3 contains two studies concerned with the development and validation of the Inventory of Essential Team Ingredients (IETI), designed to measure each sub-component of the ETI model. The first study adopted a new paradigm of measurement design to validate a multi-construct, single-item based inventory. The second study examined the extent to which factors within the ETI model could accurately predict effective teams in a sample of 32 high performing male and female cricket teams. Through the application of novel pattern recognition analyses, results suggested that certain features could accurately predict an effective team in nearly 90% of instances. Chapter 4 presents an intervention study, whereby a team building intervention based on the IETI was designed, delivered and evaluated, providing an indication that team functioning can be improved over a short period, and preliminary evidence for the utility of the IETI. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes the thesis by discussing some of the theoretical, conceptual, and applied implications of the findings, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the research and potential avenues of future research.","To produce superior team performances members must be able to work well together to exceed the sum of their parts.

The Isolated and Confined Environments Questionnaire results showed significant variation with no clear trend. Statistical significance was seen in social and emotional domains between sex and occupations. Positive and Negative Affect Scale scoring demonstrated higher positive affect (mean ± SD; 38.9 ± 1.5) to negative (13.1 ± 1.3). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significance for negative affect between sexes (one result skewed the data). The interviews highlighted that individuals found the routine and lack of personal space challenging.

599,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,Airport territory as interface: mobile work and travel in hybrid space,"Global mobility, wireless technology and networked society are transforming the airport territory. These changes (hard factors) have been analysed in airport planning and transportation studies (Koll-Schretzenmayr 2003; Banister 2003; Schaafsma 2003; Knippenberger &Wall 2010; Salewski & Michaelli 2011; Convenz & Thierstein ed. 2014 et al) and architecture and design (Edwards 1998; Blow 2005; Cuadra 2002; Uffelen 2012; Gensler 2013 et al). But design strategies focusing on the passenger experience (soft factors) have not yet been thoroughly assimilated by architecture and design. On the theoretical level this dissertation spans the analysis of current methodologies in social studies (e.g. Castells 1996; Gottdiener 2000; Cresswell 2006; Urry, 2007; Elliott & Urry 2010; Adey 2010 et al) and their relation to architectural and urban studies concepts for the airport. The latter includes the “Airport as City” (Güller & Güller 2000), “Aviopolis – A Book about Airports” (Fuller & Harley 2005) and “Aerotropolis” (Kassarda 2010). This dissertation also explores IT and aviation industry interests at the interface between technology and air travellers. In this light aviation industry research and solutions (Amadeus 2011, SITA 2013) are important to consider, as well the philosophy behind who travels and for what purpose (Sloterdijk 1998; Koolhaas 1998; Gottdiener 2000; Urry 2007; Birtchnell & Caletrio 2014 et al). Here, the author’s previous field research at Frankfurt International Airport is relevant. We live more mobile lifestyles, we work in hybrid spaces (Suoza 2006; Duffy 2010 et al), and we consequently need to share information and collaborate differently. Using constant travellers as a case study, the impact of physical and informational mobility on perceptions of and behavioural patterns in the airport can lead to a deeper understanding of mobile work and the air travel experience. New design strategies can be developed from research about constant travellers, and the results may improve their work and air travel experience. The author’s combination of design approaches from architecture and social science (sociology and psychology) methodologies can better address the real needs of constant travellers in hybrid workspaces. It is hoped that this dissertation will inspire airport architects and designers, interaction designers and the aviation industry to pay more attention to users’ needs in their design processes.","Global mobility, wireless technology and networked society are transforming the airport territory.

611,2024,"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Practice effects of a breathing technique on pilots' cognitive and stress associated heart rate variability during flight operations,"Commercial pilots endure multiple stressors in their daily and occupational lives which are detrimental to psychological well-being and cognitive functioning. The Quick coherence technique (QCT) is an effective intervention tool to improve stress resilience and psychophysiological balance based on a five-minute paced breathing exercise with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback. The current research reports on the application of QCT training within an international airline to improve commercial pilots' psychological health and support cognitive functions. Forty-four commercial pilots volunteered in a one-month training programme to practise self-regulated QCT in day-to-day life and flight operations. Pilots' stress index, HRV time-domain and frequency-domain parameters were collected to examine the influence of QCT practice on the stress resilience process. The results demonstrated that the QCT improved psychophysiological indicators associated with stress resilience and cognitive functions, in both day-to-day life and flight operation settings. HRV fluctuations, as measured through changes in RMSSD and LF/HF, revealed that the resilience processes were primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activities that are important in promoting pilots' energy mobilization and cognitive functions, thus QCT has huge potential in facilitating flight performance and aviation safety. These findings provide scientific evidence for implementing QCT as an effective mental support programme and controlled rest strategy to improve pilots' psychological health, stress management, and operational performance.Commercial pilots endure multiple stressors in their daily and occupational lives which are detrimental to psychological well-being and cognitive functioning.

613,1999,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Towards a stereoscopic plan position indicator display,"Within a 90° viewpoint-elevation, stereoscopic display, a series of experiments examined the effects on perceived object location of manipulations of three monocular depth cues: relative size, relative luminance and linear disparity. The early experiments required subjects to make 'closer/farther' depth discriminations between a central 'target' object and two flanking objects of constant size and luminance. The depth within the configuration was determined by the relative disparity between the target and flanking objects. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that when target size (visual angle), or luminance, was varied relative to the two flanking objects independently of the depth between them, two of the four subjects' closer/farther depth judgements were little affected. The other two subjects were influenced to a far larger extent by the manipulations of relative size and luminance. For these two subjects an increase/decrease in target size relative to the flankers of around 3 arc min equated to a depth shift of around 5 arc min of disparity. A doubling/halving of target luminance around the standard level of 20 cd/m2 equated to a depth shift of over 5 arc min of disparity. Experiments 4 and 5 showed this type of perceptual behaviour occurred in approximately 30% of a larger sample of 84 subjects and that for the original two subjects, the observed effects of size/luminance variations could be reduced by increasing stimulus presentation time from 500 msec to 1000 msec. It is concluded that for presentation times of around 500 msec, accurate relative depth judgements in a stereoscopic display are better supported by varying the size (visual angle) of a target object with its depth in a veridical manner. Experiments 8-16 employed a stereoscopic, radar-like display. Subjects were required to indicate the elevation angle of a target relative to the range-ring plane of the display. Results showed a cyclical effect of target azimuth on elevation judgements such that the maximum errors occurred at the 0° and 180° azimuths while the minimum errors occurred at the 90° and 270° azimuths. The use of a veridical perspective projection had two effects: the cyclical variation of target elevation error with target azimuth disappeared and the absolute error across all azimuths and elevations reduced. Manipulations of the GFOV of the perspective projection produced conflicting results. Comparing the mean absolute elevation judgement error across three separate experiments indicated reducing error with increasing GFOV. However, the results of a completely within-subjects design experiment showed an increase in distance judgement error with increasing GFOV. It is concluded that a perspective projection supports more accurate performance in a stereoscopic display than a parallel projection.","Within a 90° viewpoint-elevation, stereoscopic display, a series of experiments examined the effects on perceived object location of manipulations of three monocular depth cues: relative size, relative luminance and linear disparity.

Drones are proliferating rapidly, even before a consensus about their formal name has formed. Most of the attention on and concern about drone proliferation has focused on clandestine strikes by the US Central Intelligence Agency and US military outside the US. This boon in drone research, purchasing, and deployment far outpaces the incipient initiatives to enact rules and laws to regulate this new technology. Advances in communications, aviation, and surveillance technology have all accelerated the coming of UAVs to the home front. But drones are not just about technological advances -- politics and money are also important factors in drone proliferation, and the CCUS is at the forefront. CCUS cosponsors annual drone fete with the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, an industry group that brings together leading drone manufacturers.

He received his BS from Case Western Reserve University in 1948, his MS in psychometrics, working with Robert Thorndike in 1950, and his PhD in social psychology from Columbia University in 1952. After serving as a naval aviation psychologist during the Korean War, Ed began his academic career at Carnegie Mellon, initiating work on leadership that led to a 20-year research program at the State University of New York at Buffalo where he was also founding director of the doctoral program in social/organizational psychology and provost of social sciences. In 1989, he became the City University of New York Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Baruch College until his retirement in 1999. During his career, he had many visiting appointments, including the Tavistock Institute, Harvard, Oxford, the National Academy of Sciences, and Istanbul University. Hollander also served as president of the Eastern Psychological Association and American Psychological Association (APA) Division 1, APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP), and on the Governing Council of the International Society of Political Psychology. He received a distinguished career award from the International Association of Applied Psychology, the International Leadership Association, the Network of Leadership Scholars, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Center for Creative Leadership. His landmark books, including Leaders, Groups, and Influence (1964) and Leadership Dynamics (1978), positioned leadership as an influence process occurring at the nexus of leader, followers, and organizational context. Ed emphasized the importance of an engaged followership to the study of leadership, rather than focusing primarily on the leader. He is perhaps best known for the idiosyncrasy credit model, a framework that details how follower perceptions affect leader behavior.",Memorializes Edwin P. Hollander (1927-2020).

This highlights the critical role of human factors in mitigating such events. This article delves into the complex interplay of human factors contributing to unreliable airspeed incidents, analyzing common causes of crew response errors, such as situation awareness failures, automation complacency, cognitive biases, communication breakdowns, and inadequate training. Drawing upon established human factor models like SHELL, Dirty Dozen, Rasmussen's Model, Reason's Swiss Cheese Model, and GEMS, the article provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing crew performance. Furthermore, it examines contributing factors like workload, fatigue, and safety culture, while proposing mitigation strategies including optimized cockpit design, enhanced training programs, improved crew resource management, and robust safety culture development. Additionally, the article presents a comparative analysis of the Air France Flight 447 and AirAsia Flight 8501 accidents, highlighting critical lessons learned. Finally, it identifies avenues for future research, including exploring the application of artificial intelligence in mitigating unreliable airspeed events, understanding the impact of pilot physiological and psychological states, and investigating cross-cultural factors and the interaction of human factors with other safety elements. By addressing these multifaceted aspects, we can strive towards a safer aviation environment for both passengers and crew.","Conference Title: 2024 10th Asia Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering (MEAE)Conference Start Date: 2024 Oct. 18Conference End Date: 2024 Oct. 20Conference Location: Taichang, ChinaUnreliable airspeed events remain a persistent threat to aviation safety, often culminating in catastrophic accidents despite advancements in cockpit technology.","<title>Human Factors in Unreliable Airspeed Events</title> <excerpt>Conference Title: 2024 10th Asia Conference on Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering (MEAE)Conference Start Date: 2024 Oct. 18Conference End Date: 2024 Oct. 20Conference Location: Taichang, ChinaUnreliable airspeed events remain a persistent threat to aviation safety, often culminating in catastrophic accidents despite advancements in cockpit technology.</excerpt>"

Accident investigation reports continue to highlight the relationship between restricted sleep and poor safety outcomes. However, to date we have a limited understanding of how sleep and HEA interact. A total of 302 sectors of normal airline flight operations were observed by trained observers, and instances of heightened emotional activity were recorded. During the cruise phase of each of these sectors, crew members were asked to calculate the amount of sleep they had obtained in previous 24 and 48h. In the 302 sectors of normal flight operations, 535 instances of HEA were observed. Descriptive analyses of instances of HEA and sleep in the prior 24 and 48h showed a significant relationship between the occurrence of HEA and recent sleep. The relationship between restricted sleep and HEA suggests that there may well be further implications with respect to operational safety.","This study aims to investigate (1) the relationship between restricted sleep and Heightened Emotional Activity (HEA) during normal flight operations, and (2) whether sleep patterns influence the strength of the HEA as a response to threats.

One technique is observational learning, or backseating in aviation training, which can accelerate pilot training. This study aimed to analyze the factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation of backseating in flight schools. The perceptions of students, instructors, and managers were investigated using an ethnographic approach. The results show that recognizing the benefits of implementation and the need for change, no extra financial burden, exposure of instructors to different pedagogies, and involvement of instructors in the decision-making process would facilitate the implementation of backseating. Additionally, factors such as practicality issues for implementation, concern about students’ needs, instructors’ self-confidence and emotions, lack of follow-up by managers, and regulatory ambiguity hinder implementation. To implement backseating, legislative ambiguity, instructors’ confidence and emotions, and their concerns about students’ needs should be addressed.","Flight training is a lengthy and resource-intensive process with additional learning, and teaching techniques are often overlooked.

663,2020,The American Journal of Psychology,Parallel Development of James J. Gibson's Ecological and Paul M. Fitts's Information Processing Approaches to Perception and Performance,"James J. Gibson and Paul M. Fitts, two psychologists who had, and continue to have, a substantial influence on research in perception, action, and human performance, had remarkable, parallel careers with roots in the U.S. Army Air Forces Aviation Psychology program in World War II. Fitts is widely regarded as founder of the applied field of engineering psychology and the basic field of human performance, both based on a human information processing approach. Gibson founded ecological psychology, a school of thought that runs counter to the information processing approach and adopts a radical empiricist approach to perception and action in natural environments. Despite the origins of their disparate views in applied aviation psychology and each having had major impacts on the field of psychology, Gibson and Fitts seem to have had little contact with each other, and their research traditions have continued primarily along separate paths to this day. In this article, we review the arcs of Fitts's and Gibson's careers, emphasizing similarities and differences historically and theoretically. We end with a discussion of why their approaches differed widely, whether attempts to reconcile them can be meaningful, and the importance of experimental psychologists attending to applied research problems.","James J.

At first, the security is defined and the considerations of the air passenger security on the ground and in the air are discussed. Subsequently, current aspects shaping the European aviation security policy are introduced. The analysis of stakeholders and their roles in aviation security is presented. The passengers' perspective is of special focus. Next, security measures such as physical security measures and personnel are presented while specific issues such as technology deployment, standards and passenger acceptance are discussed in the European context. New concept for security is introduced. The analysis conducted leads us to the conclusions. The existing security system at European airports is rather reactive than proactive. The new concepts rely heavily on technological developments while it is crucial to increase the focus on intelligence gathering and passenger experience. Based on the identified gaps in the existing literature, further research should focus on CBA of European aviation security system as well as human drivers of (in)security.

666,2017,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Cognitive Evaluation of Israeli Air Force Pilot Cadets,"OBJECTIVE: In aviation psychology, there is a constant need for the cognitive evaluation of pilots as part of operational fitness and safety criteria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with comparison between the performance of Israeli Air Force pilot cadets (N = 318) and U.S. Air Force pilot training candidates (N = 512) as assessed by a cognitive battery was undertaken. The data of the comparison group was collected from Callister, King, and Retzlaff, as published in 1996. RESULTS: In general, the means in the three components composing the battery-speed, accuracy, and throughput variables-indicated that the Israeli Air Force pilot cadets' scores were higher than those of the U.S. Air Force pilot candidates' scores in 50 of 53 variables. Nonsignificant differences were found in Accuracy of shifting attention-arrow color (SATAC), pathfinder-combined (PFC), and pathfinder-letter (PFL). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in performance between the two groups may be due to differences in population characteristics. However, these results need to be considered cautiously, as the groups were sampled at a sizeable time gap (1996 for the U.S. Air Force vs. 2013 for the Israeli Air Force), with each time period characterized by different cultural and technological influences.

667,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Psychological Skills of Canadian Military Pilots,"For decades, elite athletes have used mental skills training to enhance their performance. The effectiveness of these skills and strategies have been measured, documented and supported in research (e.g., Feltz & Landers, 1983; Vealey, 1994). As the remarkable benefits of mental skills continue to reach an ever?-growing community of performers, it is surprising that many military organizations, known for their high standards for performance and little tolerance for error, have yet to take full advantage of this type of training. Canada's Air Force (CAF), home to a world?-renowned pilot training program, now finds itself seeking additional tools to empower pilots to achieve consistent, high quality performance under demanding, high stress conditions.The purpose of this research was to explore the psychological skills used by elite Canadian military pilots to perform successfully in this highly demanding occupation. Sixteen in?-depth interviews were conducted with elite Canadian pilots at a CAF base in Saskatchewan. Results indicated that pilots utilized all seven elements of Orlick?'s (2008) Wheel of Excellence over three phases of flight: pre?-flight preparation, mission execution, and post?-flight debriefs. Pilots also drew on elements of the Wheel of Excellence during deployments to combat zones. Effective stress management played an especially important role in this context. Recommendations for future research include mental skills usage and preparation specific to deployment contexts as well as the implementation of a specific, relevant mental skills training program within the existing CAF pilot training program.","For decades, elite athletes have used mental skills training to enhance their performance.

671,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,"Who is responsible? Communication, coordination, and collaboration in the future air traffic management system","International civil aviation has experienced a steady growth in the past decades that is foreseen to continue. To overcome capacity limits of the old Air Traffic Control systems, new technology is currently being developed and introduced. While the current way of conducting air traffic has evolved in a continuous manner, the new technologies are part of a new paradigm that has the potential to completely reform aviation. Under this paradigm, it is envisaged that pilots may engage in surveillance tasks, which poses new demands on coordination between controllers and pilots. This thesis describes basic properties of current and new technology and procedures within civil aviation and the relation to distribution of tasks and responsibilities between pilots and controllers. It is recognised that the current distribution is largely based on the development of technological tools. As new technology allows information in the aviation system to be shared to much greater extent than in the present operational environment, it implies that the basis for present task allocation between controllers and pilots may be challenged. For new technology to be viable, appropriate procedures must be developed to assure safety within the air traffic system. To gain wide insight into current aviation, a multitude of data-collection methods have been applied including interviews, observations, and simulations. Interviews have been performed with controllers from several European countries. Observations have been performed in operational Air Traffic Control as well as operational flight. Observations have also been performed in simulations where some applications of the new technology have been investigated. Questionnaires were distributed to both pilots and controllers in a real-time simulation investigating Free Flight issues. Results show that operational activity is characterised by a large degree of flexibility. In some applications of new technology, certain tools and procedures have been identified that have been regarded inflexible. It is emphasised that continued development should be performed in international cooperation and introduced into operation gradually to minimise shortfalls of training.","International civil aviation has experienced a steady growth in the past decades that is foreseen to continue.

Some countries have taken it as a necessary condition for obtaining airline flight licenses, and it is also a key research topic of civil aviation in China in recent years. Piloting resource management is an important branch of human factors in flight. It is the specific application of aviation psychology, management psychology, social psychology and other disciplines in the piloting ship. At present, the flight crew has carried out CRM and route flight training (Loft), and has integrated the concept of CRM into flight technical training. However, the research on the level of pilots' situational awareness lacks quantitative analysis of all technical requirements of each type of aircraft training.

The field of aviation provides a unique opportunity to investigate how perception, action and cognition interact in complex yet controlled ecologically valid environments. We suggest a novel cross-domain approach that combines insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition with a neurophysiological framework to explain patterns of human performance across a variety of aviation contexts. Specifically, we argue that studying the interaction between an agent and the environment, as manifest in the Mirror Neuron system as a neural correlate, is key to understanding complex behavior. We can describe the experience and skills involved with task-relevant actions - like flying an airplane - using brain mechanisms of motor simulation of the observed action. With this direct coupling between perception and action, the automatic implicit nature of the Mirror Neuron system can be harnessed to improve human factor and ergonomics. This analysis offers three areas for future study and application: (1) enhancing flight training by isolating specific agent-environment relations; (2) tracking training progression based on brain signatures of flight expertise; and (3) neuroscientific-inspired ecological design of next-generation human-machine interfaces in flight decks.","A great challenge for cognitive neuroscience is studying human behavior in its complexity as it manifests in the real world.

Drawing upon self-determination theory, this study examines whether, how, and when the sense of calling influences pilot safety behavior from the perspective of occupational psychology. Using a sample of 321 Chinese commercial airline pilots, we tested a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between sense of calling and pilot safety behavior was mediated by harmonious safety passion and moderated by safety climate. The results indicated that the sense of calling had a positive direct effect on pilot safety behavior and that this relationship was partially mediated by harmonious safety passion. Moreover, safety climate negatively moderates the positive relationship between sense of calling and harmonious safety passion as well as the indirect effect of sense of calling on safety behavior via harmonious safety passion. In particular, sense of calling had a stronger effect on harmonious safety passion and a stronger indirect effect on safety behavior when the safety climate was lower. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for aviation safety management practices are discussed.","Pilot safety behavior plays a crucial role in airlines safety performance and aviation safety, so it is vital to identify factors that may enhance pilot safety behavior and explore their mechanisms.

Below-average scores on tests designed to measure facial expression recognition (FER) accuracies are associated with inappropriate behavioral responses and are often linked to mental or neurological disorders. Head-down bed rest microgravity analog studies show changes in facial emotion processing that may indicate a behavioral health risk during spaceflight.During short-duration space analog missions at two separate facilities, 15 subjects took daily FER tests before, during, and after the mission. Each test was accompanied by questionnaires measuring either potential causal or impacted variables: stress, depression, loneliness, irritability, risk-taking, empathy, and intrinsic motivation.METHODSDuring short-duration space analog missions at two separate facilities, 15 subjects took daily FER tests before, during, and after the mission. Each test was accompanied by questionnaires measuring either potential causal or impacted variables: stress, depression, loneliness, irritability, risk-taking, empathy, and intrinsic motivation.Analysis of variance and post hoc t-tests showed that during the mission, the subjects were less likely to identify angry, sad, or fearful faces as disgusted compared to the baseline. Also, interest/enjoyment and perceived competence increased throughout the mission lifecycle. Multiple regression analyses were able to account for greater than 20% of the variance for depression and health/safety risk-taking using the FER data.RESULTSAnalysis of variance and post hoc t-tests showed that during the mission, the subjects were less likely to identify angry, sad, or fearful faces as disgusted compared to the baseline. Also, interest/enjoyment and perceived competence increased throughout the mission lifecycle. Multiple regression analyses were able to account for greater than 20% of the variance for depression and health/safety risk-taking using the FER data.Changes in FER during space mission simulations show that perception changes are not limited to microgravity analogs. A perceptual change was observed during the short-duration missions, but there is not sufficient evidence to show behavioral health impacts. However, associations between FER and the questionnaires show a potential to develop predictive models, countermeasures, or psychological monitoring tools using FER. Additional research is required to determine the efficacy of such tools during long-duration spaceflight. Van Hoy S. Facial expression perception and psychological changes during space analogs.

It is imperative to develop an effective fatigue risk management system to improve aviation safety based upon scientific approaches.Two empirical studies were conducted to address this issue. Study 1 investigated the mixed effect of circadian rhythm disorders and resource depletion on controllers’ accumulated fatigue. Then, study 2 proposed a potential biofeedback solution of quick coherence technique which can mitigate air traffic controllers’ (ATCOs’) fatigue while on controller working position and improve ATCOs’ mental/physical health.The current two‐studies demonstrated a scientific approach to fatigue analysis and fatigue risk mitigation in the air traffic services domain. This research offers insights into the fluctuation of ATCO fatigue levels and the influence of a numbers of factors related to circadian rhythm and resource depletion impact on fatigue levels on study 1; and provides psychophysiological coherence training to increase ATCOs’ fatigue resilience to mitigate negative impacts of fatigue on study 2.Based on these two studies, the authors recommended that an extra short break for air traffic controllers to permit practicing the quick coherence breathing technique for 5 min at the sixth working hour could substantially recharge cognitive resources and increase fatigue resilience. Application: Present studies highlight an effective fatigue intervention based on objective biofeedback to moderate controllers’ accumulated fatigue as a result of rotating shift work. Accordingly, air navigation services providers and regulators can develop fatigue risk management systems based on scientific approaches to improve aviation safety and air traffic controller's wellbeing.","The nature of the current rotating roster, providing 24‐h air traffic services over five irregular shifts, leads to accumulated fatigue which impairs air traffic controllers’ cognitive function and task performance.

Because helicopter parenting could undermine empathic and prosocial outcomes by negatively impacting self-regulatory behaviors and promoting narcissistic tendencies (Padilla-Walker, 2014; Segrin, Woszidlo, Givertz, Bauer, & Murphy, 2012; Segrin, Woszidlo, Givertz, & Montgomery, 2013), the author sought to examine potential relationships among these constructs. A battery of self-report measures was administered to an emerging adult sample (N = 187 college students; 49% women; M age = 18.81 years; 71% White). Hierarchical multiple regression model results indicated that both maternal and paternal helicopter parenting predicted fewer positive prosocial and empathic outcomes, and these relations depended on parental attachment, gender, and specific outcome assessed. Helicopter parenting appears to be a distinct type of parental overcontrol that especially contributes to moral development.","While previous research has established links among multiple aspects of parenting, empathy, and prosocial behaviors in youth, little is known regarding the relations between helicopter parenting, a particular type of parental over control, and empathy and prosocial behaviors (Padilla-Walker, 2014).

But little is known about how the processes of categorization stand up to visual complexity. The authors filled this research gap with screening tasks in which participants searched for members of target categories in visual displays. The authors found that when targets were sampled with replacement and repetition, participant screeners relied on recognizing familiar targets and had great difficulty using category-general knowledge. The authors observed a heartbeat in detection performance it improved while test images repeated but dropped sharply when unfamiliar targets from the same categories appeared. This reliance on familiarity illuminates the processes of categorization under conditions of visual complexity and suggests limits on those processes. This reliance also has implications for the training and evaluation of screeners in the field.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",Screeners at airport security checkpoints perform an important categorization task in which they search for threat items in complex x-ray images.

We conducted 2 experiments in which novices and expert pilots viewed simulated aircraft landing scenes. The scenes were interrupted by the display of a black screen and then started again after a forward or backward shift. The participant's task was to determine whether the moving scene had been shifted forward or backward. A forward misjudgment of the final position of the moving scene was interpreted as a representational momentum (RM) effect. Experiment 1 showed that an RM effect was detected only for experts. The lack of motion anticipation on the part of novices is a surprising result for the RM literature. It could be related to scene unfamiliarity, encoding time, or shift size. Experiment 2 was run with novices only. It was aimed at testing the potential impact of 2 factors on the RM effect: scene encoding time and shift size. As a whole, the results showed that encoding time and shift size are important factors in anticipation processes in realistic dynamic situations.

In both experiments, the concurrent chains were presented on a microcomputer in the form of an air-defense game in which subjects used two radar systems to detect and subsequently destroy enemy aircraft. Access to one of two radar systems was controlled by a pair of independent concurrent variable-interval 60-s schedules with a 4-s changeover delay always in effect. In the terminal link, the appearance of an enemy aircraft was determined by a pair of differentially segmented fixed-time schedules (Experiment 1) or fixed-interval schedules (Experiment 2) of equal overall duration. In Experiment 1, the terminal-link duration was either 20 s or 40 s, and subjects preferred the unsegmented to the segmented intervals. In Experiment 2, the duration was either 10 s or 60 s, and the reinforcement contingencies required responding during the terminal link. Prior to the reinstatement of the initial link, subjects estimated the duration of the terminal-link schedule. Segmentation affected choice in the 60-s conditions but not in the 10-s ones. Preference for the unsegmented schedule was correlated with an overestimation of the durations for the segmented schedules. These results replicated those found in animal experiments and support the notion of increasing the psychological distance to reward by segmenting a time-based schedule of reinforcement.","Choice behavior in college students was examined in two experiments using the concurrent-chains procedure.

This study’s primary purpose is to determine how UAVs that operate in controlled airspace would influence air traffic controllers’ occupational stress and performance. In a within-subject experimental research design, 24 participants sampled from a university’s undergraduate Air Traffic Management (ATM) program completed three different air traffic control (ATC) scenarios on an en route ATC simulation system. The degree of UAV automation and control were varied in each scenario. The participants’ stress levels, performance, and workload were measured with both objective and subjective measurements. Within-subjects ANOVA tests showed significant effects on the participants’ stress level, performance, and workload when automated UAVs were present in the scenario. Participants experienced increased workload, the highest level of stress, and carried out the worst performance when with controllable UAVs in the airspace. These findings can inform UAV integration into controlled airspace and future research into UAV automation and control and ATC management.","As demand for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations increases, it is vital to understand its effects on air traffic controllers and the safety of the national airspace system.

711,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",AEROSPACE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY AND ADVANCEMENTS IN AVIATION SELECTION,"INTRODUCTION: Since the boom of naval aviation sparked by WWII, aviation psychologists have examined a variety of measures for inclusion in the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), the primary tool for selecting pilots and flight officers into naval aviation training. The current version of the ASTB, which predicts performance and attrition in the early stages of aviation training, contains subtests focused on candidates' cognitive abilities, to include math skills, reading skills, mechanical compression, spatial apperception, and aviation and nautical knowledge. Cognitive ability tests are common components of personnel selection systems as they rank among the strongest predictors of future performance in nearly any job. However, numerous other personal and psychological characteristics can add value to a selection system when based on a proper job analysis. To this end, Aerospace Experimental Psychologists are preparing to release an updated version of the ASTB featuring three new non-cognitive subtests designed to provide a whole person assessment of candidates' flight aptitude. These subtests include: (a) the performance-based measures battery, which assesses psychomotor aptitude, auditory information processing, ability to visualize three-dimensional relationships, and ability to divide attention among competing tasks; (b) the naval aviation trait facet inventory, which assesses aviation-relevant personality traits using an adaptive forced-choice format designed to reduce faking; and (c) the biographical inventory with response verification, which assesses factors in candidates' personal history related to success in aviation training. Preliminary results indicate that the addition of these measures should improve the prediction of performance and attrition in aviation training as well as reduce subgroup differences during the selection process, thereby resulting in a more qualified and diversified aviation training pool.","INTRODUCTION: Since the boom of naval aviation sparked by WWII, aviation psychologists have examined a variety of measures for inclusion in the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), the primary tool for selecting pilots and flight officers into naval aviation training.

713,2020,Heliyon,Recommendations for emerging air taxi network operations based on online review analysis of helicopter services,"The effects of traffic congestion are adverse, primarily including air pollution, commuter stress, an increase in vehicle operating costs, and accidents on road. In efforts to alleviate these problems in metropolitan cities, logistics companies plan to introduce a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service called air taxis. These are electric-powered vehicles that would be tested and operated in the forthcoming years by international transportation companies like Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk. Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4. The insights obtained in this paper could assist any air taxi company in providing better customer service when they venture into the market.","The effects of traffic congestion are adverse, primarily including air pollution, commuter stress, an increase in vehicle operating costs, and accidents on road.

715,2022,Safety Science,Engineering maintenance decision-making with unsupported judgement under operational constraints,"In operational engineering maintenance situations, limitations on time, resource or the information available often inhibit rigorous analysis on complex decision problems. Decision-makers who are compelled to act in such circumstances, may be informed by some level of analysis if available, or else may have to rely on their unsupported judgement. This paper presents three engineering risk decision-making case studies across a 20 year span from the rail, aerospace, and military aviation contexts, highlighting the fallibilities of using unsupported judgements in an unstructured manner. To help situate this type of decision situation, we provide a descriptive model of the decision space which extends an existing description from the discipline of decision analysis. Furthermore, to help make and describe the distinction between unsupported and supported thinking, we provide another descriptive model, this time drawing parallels with the distinction made between Type 1 and Type 2 reasoning. This model is an extension of the default-interventionist model from cognitive psychology. The paper concludes that there is a pressing need to provide some form of support to engineering decision-makers facing operational decisions under severe time pressure. While the ultimate aim must be to improve the quality of decision-making, improved transparency is an important additional benefit. Increased emphasis on decision justification and self-awareness are suggested as potential ways of improving this situation. A further contribution of this paper is to identify and strengthen linkages between safety science and two other relevant disciplines, decision analysis and psychology. Such linkages make it easier to communicate across traditional disciplinary boundaries and may provide opportunities for interdisciplinary learning or suggest future directions for collaborative research.","In operational engineering maintenance situations, limitations on time, resource or the information available often inhibit rigorous analysis on complex decision problems.

720,1993,Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior,Psychological distance to reward: Segmentation of aperiodic schedules of reinforcement,"College students responded for monetary rewards in two experiments on choice between differentially segmented aperiodic schedules of reinforcement. On a microcomputer, the concurrent chains were simulated as an air-defense video game in which subjects used two radars for detecting and destroying enemy aircraft. To earn more cash-exchangeable points, subjects had to shoot down as many planes as possible within a given period of time. For both experiments, access to one of two radar systems (terminal link) was controlled by a pair of independent concurrent variable-interval 60-s schedules (initial link) with a 4-s changeover delay always in effect. In Experiment 1, the appearance of an enemy aircraft in the terminal link was determined by a variable-interval (15 s or 60 s) schedule or a two-component chained variable-interval schedule of equal duration. Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1 except for the segmented schedule, which had three components. Subjects preferred the unsegmented schedule over its segmented counterpart in the conditions with variable-interval 60 s, and preference tended to be more pronounced with more components in the segmented schedule. These findings are compatible with those from previous studies of periodic and aperiodic schedules with pigeons or humans as subjects.","College students responded for monetary rewards in two experiments on choice between differentially segmented aperiodic schedules of reinforcement.

Prominent examples are the programs directed by Yerkes in World War I to develop the Army Alpha test and several programs in World War II, including ""The American Soldier"" that assessed soldiers' attitudes during the war; a program for selecting agents for the Office of Strategic Services; and the Aviation Psychology Program to select and classify applicants for flight training in the Army Air Forces. Highlights of these programs are presented here, with special attention given to by far the largest, the Air Forces program. After World War II, many of the hundreds of psychologist veterans became prominent research psychologists. Most became university professors. Among those who continued to work in applied settings was John Flanagan who had served as Chief of the Army Air Forces Psychology Branch. (After the war, Saul Sells succeeded Flanagan as Head of the Aviation Psychology program.) Flanagan founded the American Institutes for Research (AIR), the earliest mission of which was to select flight personnel for civilian airlines. Another part of the AIR mission was to enhance civilian air safety by assuring the widespread use of Flanagan's critical-incident procedures (or near-accident reports) that now serve to reduce accident rates in a variety of industries as well as in aviation.

723,2020,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,Unmanned Passenger Aircraft Technology: A Quantitative Analysis of Acceptance Within the Aviation Pilot Population,"The proposed use of unmanned passenger aircraft (UPA) to mitigate the looming pilot shortage continues to attract attention from the transportation sector and media outlets. Cost savings and flight safety are also key factors in UPA implementation considerations. It is important to understand aviation pilot perceptions and intentions towards this emerging technology. The public will look to pilots, as subject matter experts, for guidance as to the safety and value of UPA technology. As such, pilot acceptance is a strong indicator as to the viability of successful introduction of unmanned passenger flight systems. To date, no study was found that has examined how the relationship between aviation pilots and acceptance of this emerging technology might be affected by factors such as experience, media influence, and the perceived usefulness of the technology. Utilizing the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology constructs, this paper describes a quantitative experiment in which aviation pilots were questioned via electronic survey as to their acceptance of unmanned passenger aircraft (UPA). Acceptance of the technology was based on their perceptions and intentions around this technology. Data were collected from aviation pilot respondents in the United States. The results were definitive; there was a significant difference in intention to use UPA technology based on demographic variables including experience and perceived usefulness. By determining which variables affect pilots’ perceptions and intentions around UPA technology, aviation interests can address pilot concerns more effectively and well in advance of UPA implementation.",The proposed use of unmanned passenger aircraft (UPA) to mitigate the looming pilot shortage continues to attract attention from the transportation sector and media outlets.

Spatial filtering had opposite effects on faces and airplanes that were modulated by categorization level. The absence of low frequencies impaired the categorization of faces similarly at both levels, whereas the absence of high frequencies was inconsequential throughout. In contrast, basic-level categorization of airplanes was equally impaired by the absence of either low or high frequencies, whereas at the subordinate level, the absence of high frequencies had more deleterious effects. These data suggest that categorization of faces either at the basic level or by race is based primarily on their global shape but also on the configuration of details. By contrast, basic-level categorization of objects is based on their global shape, whereas category-specific diagnostic details determine the information needed for their subordinate categorization. The authors conclude that the entry point in visual recognition is flexible and determined conjointly by the stimulus category and the level of categorization, which reflects the observer's recognition goal.

Eighteen commercial pilots voluntarily participated in a 2-day training course on QCT followed by 2 months of self-regulated QCT practicing during controlled rest in the flight deck and day-to day life. There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots’ psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots’ psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots’ mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique.

This calls for a methodology to predict the flight traffic to provide strategic planning on flight schedules operational, route structuring, and flight navigation service cost determination. However, current developments mainly focus on flight traffic forecasting based on historical data without considering external factors. In this study, we propose the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique to forecast flight traffic in Indonesia involving external variables such as macroeconomic variables and Google Trends. LSTM is proposed because of its flexibility to model non-linear time series data and has a good reputation for predictive accuracy. We first select a few among Google Trends and macroeconomic variables using nonlinearity analysis and cross-correlation function (CCF). We then employ the selected variables to forecast the flight traffic and compare it to the one using only historical flight traffic data. Our results concluded, based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), that the model involving google trend outperforms the other three models, i.e., the model with only historical data, the model with macroeconomics, and the model with both macroeconomic and Google Trends. It is because, in this digital era, Google Trends can reflect population psychology in an up-to-date manner.","Conference Title: 2022 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA)Conference Start Date:  2022,  July  6 Conference End Date:  2022,  July  7 Conference Location: Bandung, IndonesiaThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many sectors.

733,2016,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Screening and Mitigation of Layperson Anxiety in Aerospace Environments,"INTRODUCTION: Anxiety may present challenges for commercial spaceflight operations, as little is known regarding the psychological effects of spaceflight on laypersons. A recent investigation evaluated measures of anxiety during centrifuge-simulated suborbital commercial spaceflight, highlighting the potential for severe anxiousness to interrupt spaceflight operations. METHODS: To pave the way for future research, an extensive literature review identified existing knowledge that may contribute to formation of interventions for anxiety in commercial spaceflight. Useful literature was identified regarding anxiety from a variety of fields, including centrifugation, fear of flying, motion sickness, and military operations. RESULTS: Fear of flying is the most extensively studied area, with some supportive evidence from centrifugation studies. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) is as effective as actual training flight exposure (or analog exposure) in mitigation of flight-related anxiety. The addition of other modalities, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback, to VRE improves desensitization compared to VRE alone. Motion sickness-susceptible individuals demonstrate higher trait anxiety than nonsusceptible individuals; for this reason, motion sickness susceptibility questionnaires may be useful measures to identify at-risk individuals. Some military studies indicate that psychiatric history and personality classification may have predictive value in future research. Medication countermeasures consisting of benzodiazepines may quell in-flight anxiety, but do not likely improve anxiety on repeat exposure. DISCUSSION: The scarce available literature addressing anxiety in unique environments indicates that training/repeated exposure may mitigate anxiety. Anxiety and personality indices may be helpful screening tools, while pharmaceuticals may be useful countermeasures when needed. Mulcahy RA, Blue RS, Vardiman JL, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

734,2021,International Journal of Training & Development,Predicting aviation training performance with multimodal affective inferences,"Affect influences learning and training through various cognitive, psychomotor and motivational processes. This research aims to examine the role of affect in aviation training. Participants’ (N = 19) affect and performance were examined in simulated aviation training while they performed ten tasks. Affective states were inferred from electrodermal activity, facial expression and NASA Taskload Index. Performance accuracy was graded with the rubrics provided by pilot instructors in CAE Inc. We found that arousal (inferred from electrodermal activity) positively predicted performance in the level 2 (easy) task (F(1, 17) = 7.408, p < 0.05, std β = 0.55).

735,2016,Applied ergonomics,Effects of mild hypoxia in aviation on mood and complex cognition,"Thirty six volunteer air force personnel were sequentially exposed in a randomized balanced order in a hypobaric chamber to 30 min of baseline (sea level) and mild hypoxia induced by a specified altitude (sea level, 8000 ft and 12,000 ft), followed immediately by breathing 100% oxygen from an oro-nasal mask. Mood and complex cognition were assessed. Analysis of variance indicated that mood (fatigue and vigour) remained the same at 8000 ft but fatigue was increased (p = 0.001) and vigour reduced (p = 0.035) at 12,000 ft and was restored by supplementary oxygen. Complex cognition was not significantly altered by the test conditions. The results of this study do not support prior evidence that mild hypoxia equivalent to either 8000 or 12,000 ft, impairs complex cognition, but suggests that some aspects of mood may be affected at 12,000 ft and can be restored by breathing 100% oxygen.Thirty six volunteer air force personnel were sequentially exposed in a randomized balanced order in a hypobaric chamber to 30 min of baseline (sea level) and mild hypoxia induced by a specified altitude (sea level, 8000 ft and 12,000 ft), followed immediately by breathing 100% oxygen from an oro-nasal mask.

Despite this, significant under-reporting of safety concerns occurs. One possible explanation is that because concerns cannot always be reported immediately, the outcome of the concern may influence whether reports are made. In Study 1, participants judged six vignettes in which unsafe acts were described: bad outcomes were judged as more likely to be reported than identical acts with innocuous outcomes. Informing participants that luck may determine whether an outcome is innocuous or bad could increase the reporting of unsafe acts with innocuous outcomes. Although implicit prompts did not increase the likelihood of reporting innocuous outcomes (Study 2), there was evidence that explicit prompts to report safety issues with innocuous outcomes increased the likelihood of reporting. Suggestions for further research and a means to reduce the effect of outcome bias on under-reporting are presented.

The aim of the present article is to confirm the usability of a modified Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) in the Norwegian child protection services CPS by checking a number of its psychometric properties. The SAQ is an instrument that has been widely applied and understood as valid and trustworthy for mapping employees’ views of their organisation’s safety culture. A confirmative factor analysis of data from a national survey of Norwegian CPSs demonstrated that the modified questionnaire has a factor structure which is internally consistent and matches the structure of the widely used SAQ health care questionnaire. The results indicate that the CPS-modified SAQ questionnaire could help understanding and mapping safety culture in the child protection services.","The concept of a safety culture is crucial to improving organisational risk management in several sectors, including health and aviation.

742,2023,ProQuest LLC,Understanding United States Collegiate Flight Students' Perceptions and Realities of Anxiety and Depression,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that all pilots hold a medical certificate granted by an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME), or an equivalent exemption standard. Over the years, these aeromedical examinations have grown to include aspects related to mental health, as well as a number of other factors. There are several mental health related conditions which are of concern to the FAA, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. These and other conditions can be grounds for medical disqualification, or additional testing or requirements. As a result, pilots are often wary of reporting their mental health issues. In recent years, aspects related to mental health and flying have become a topic of conversation at collegiate aviation programs across the country. This study highlights collegiate flight students' perceptions and realities associated with anxiety and depression. Results of the survey are examined in the context of four research questions, which guided the researcher's conclusions surrounding mental health within collegiate flight programs. These conclusions centered around the perceived benefit of not disclosing or ignoring mental health related conditions, whether admitting mental health related struggles has a negative impact upon flying careers, what strategies are effective to manage one's mental health, and whether flight students feel the current aeromedical process should be reviewed for possible revision.

The current study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and leadership on organizational excellence. The study attempted to identify underlying results that improved student success outcomes. The evaluation of the EI Professional Development Program was delivered in a strategic emotional learning system. The program was delivered to all students, faculty and staff through workshops and specialized training. The study was conducted through a mixed methods design, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data collection. The Emotional Skills Assessment Process (ESAP) is a 213 item instrument yielding scores on ten EI skills structured around four dimensions and three problematic score indicators (Nelson & Low, 1998). Qualitative and quantitative data were examined to determine the EI skill area scores across five academic program areas: business, medical, networking, electronics, and aviation. Student success rates and employee morale were improved, further, the EI-centric processional development program helped identify benchmarks for continuous programs and organizational improvements. Pre-and post-intervention academic statistics were assessed utilizing Hallmark College's CLASS reporting system. The findings of the study may improve educational instruction and service delivery.

In Study 1, we find parenting attitudes strongly predict paternalistic policy attitudes-more than ideology, party identity, or any other measured demographic variables. In Study 2, we attempt to establish a causal link, but find manipulating preferences for helicopter parenting does not influence policy preferences as Lakoff's model would suggest. In Study 3, we identify a latent variable that predicts preferences for paternalism in parenting, policy, and a host of other domains such as business, medicine, and education. We discuss implications for Lakoff's theory, the political psychology of libertarianism/paternalism, and society at large.","Lakoff's model of political ideology proposes people's beliefs about how government should operate are grounded in beliefs about how families should operate.

750,2012,Journal of Transportation Security,Assessing the security benefits of a trusted traveler program in the presence of attempted attacker exploitation and compromise,"Current aviation security procedures screen all passengers uniformly. Varying the amount of screening individuals receive based on an assessment of their relative risk has the potential to reduce the security burdens on some travelers, while improving security overall. In this paper we examine the security costs and benefits of a trusted traveler program, in which individuals who have been identified as posting less risk than others are allowed to pass through security with reduced security screening. This allows security resources to be shifted from travelers who have been identified as low risk, to the remaining unknown-risk population. However, fears that terrorists may exploit trusted traveler programs have dissuaded adoption of such programs. Our analysis estimates the security performance of a trusted traveler program in the presence of attacker attempts to compromise it. We found that, although these attempts would reduce the maximum potential security benefits of a program, they would not eliminate those benefits in all circumstances.

751,2019,Biological conservation,Learning from published project failures in conservation,"Conservation professionals need to know what has worked and what has not when designing, implementing, evaluating and refining conservation projects. Project failure reporting is an important, but largely unexploited, source of learning that capitalizes on the learning opportunity of failure provided through the experience of navigating research-implementation ‘spaces’. Learning from others through reading available literature is one way to supplement learning gained through direct experience. Learning vicariously is especially effective when presenting failure as opposed to success experiences. We reviewed the peer-reviewed conservation science literature to identify the extent and characteristics of failed project reporting, focusing our analysis upon social dimensions as opposed to biological causes, which have been comparatively well addressed. We quantified the degree to which articles reported activities commonly applied to learn from failure in business, medicine, the military and commercial aviation. These included activities for identifying, analyzing, correcting and sharing project failures. We used qualitative thematic analysis to identify the social causes of project failure. Reports of failed project experiences are rare and lack standardization. Human dimensions of project failure, such as stakeholder relationships, are more commonly reported than other causes of failure. The peer-reviewed literature has the potential to become a useful repository of lessons learned from failed projects. However, practical challenges such as identifying individuals' cognitive biases, cultivating psychological safety in teams, mainstreaming systemic team learning behaviors, addressing varied leadership styles, and confronting fear of failure in organizational culture must be overcome if conservation professionals are to effectively navigate research-implementation ‘spaces’.","Conservation professionals need to know what has worked and what has not when designing, implementing, evaluating and refining conservation projects.

755,2012,ProQuest LLC,Factors of Non-Persistence in Civilian Helicopter Flight Training: A Narrative Inquiry of Pilot Attrition,"Previous literature on retention of student helicopter pilots shows a gap in research of civilian schools and qualitative studies. To address this gap in the literature and to help helicopter flight schools better understand the incidents of attrition from flight training, this qualitative study investigated student and school-based factors leading to attrition of helicopter pilot students from civilian training programs and how schools can intervene to help raise retention. The researcher interviewed four former helicopter pilot students of one Colorado flight school. Participants were chosen based on holding a private pilot certificate, having stated a goal of an aviation career, and having taken no training flights in the previous six months. Emergent themes from interview data include several linked to retention literature: motivation and interest, financial concerns, family care issues, need for remediation and learning style, social connections, and belonging. Also discussed are themes unique to study participants: safety, depression, responsibility, privilege, and disillusionment. Restoried interview data were scripted as a focus group. Recommendations to school leaders include continuing to research funding opportunities for students, addressing child-care needs, creating social and quasi-social student opportunities, contacting stop out students, creating an inclusive school environment, listening to students, creating individual student timelines, and helping instructors address students' learning styles. This research supports sub-baccalaureate retention research and articulates the individual nature of causes of attrition.

To help identify potential measures of anxiousness and indicators of flight-related stress, the psychiatric histories and anxiousness responses of volunteers exposed to G forces in centrifuge-simulated spaceflight acceleration profiles were examined. Methods: Over 2 d, 86 individuals (63 men, 23 women), 20-78 yr old, underwent up to 7 centrifuge runs. Day 1 consisted of two +G sub(z) runs (peak = +3.5 G sub(z)) and two +G sub(x) runs (peak = +6.0 G sub(x)). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G sub(x) and +G sub(z)). Hemodynamic data were collected during the profiles. Subjects completed a retrospective self-report anxiety questionnaire. Medical monitors identified individuals exhibiting varying degrees of anxiousness during centrifuge exposure, medical histories of psychiatric disease, and other potential indicators of psychological intolerance of spaceflight. Results: The retrospective survey identified 18 individuals self-reporting anxiousness, commonly related to unfamiliarity with centrifuge acceleration and concerns regarding medical history. There were 12 individuals (5 men, 7 women, average age 46.2 yr) who were observed to have anxiety that interfered with their ability to complete training; of these, 4 reported anxiousness on their questionnaire and 9 ultimately completed the centrifuge profiles. Psychiatric history was not significantly associated with anxious symptoms. Discussion: Anxiety is likely to be a relevant and potentially disabling problem for commercial spaceflight participants; however, positive psychiatric history and self-reported symptoms did not predict anxiety during centrifuge performance. Symptoms of anxiousness can often be ameliorated through training and coaching. Even highly anxious individuals are likely capable of tolerating commercial spaceflight.","Introduction: Anxiety and psychological concerns may pose a challenge to future commercial spaceflight.

As a result, pilots' competency input models for Smart City UAM have been proposed for the first time: a model for evaluating the mindset and decision making of a pilot in Smart City; model of knowledge of pilot theory knowledge in Smart City; a model for assessing flight training knowledge and flight competence for Smart City UAM; model of knowledge assessment in theory of pedagogy, psychology and communicative competence. Competence models can use a different number of rating indicators and different scale scores. A six-step general algorithm for evaluating and selecting instructor pilots for Smart City UAM has been developed for the first time, integrating different pilot competency models and taking into account the ""desired values"" of the decision-maker.

The first research was carried out before the First World War and has gained importance, especially in the last 20 years, due to the dynamic growth of civil air transport. The selection of military pilots in the Czech Air Force environment takes place within the framework of the admission procedure for study at the University of Defence (UoD) in the specialization of military pilot (MP). The selection includes medical tests, psychological tests, and knowledge tests. This paper aims to verify the suitability of using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) test battery in a shortened form to design and implement a new objective system for selecting candidates for the military pilot specialization. Current MP specialization students (n=51) and candidates in the 2022/2023 academic year (n=35) were tested. The results showed that most students tested (82%) scored low on the Neuroticism scale, and 16% are in the broader average range. On the Conscientiousness scale, a majority of the students (63%) scored high, 37% of the students were in the normal range, and none of the respondents were in the below-average range. The analysis shows that 55% of the subjects have low Neuroticism scores and high Conscientiousness scores. The pilot testing has fulfilled its purpose; there has been a validation of the tools that can be used to define the prerequisites to achieve the desired abilities and skills for the MP specialization. This form may be used to select suitable candidates for the MP specialization in the future.","Conference Title: 2023 New Trends in Aviation Development (NTAD)Conference Start Date:  2023,  Nov. 23 Conference End Date:  2023,  Nov. 24 Conference Location: Stary Smokovec, SlovakiaPilot selection has been a topic since the beginning of aviation, both in civil and military aviation.","<title>New Personality Evaluation of Pilot Candidates in Czech Air Force</title> <excerpt>Conference Title: 2023 New Trends in Aviation Development (NTAD)Conference Start Date:  2023,  Nov. 23 Conference End Date:  2023,  Nov. 24 Conference Location: Stary Smokovec, SlovakiaPilot selection has been a topic since the beginning of aviation, both in civil and military aviation.</excerpt>"

762,2012,Applied Cognitive Psychology,Confirmation Bias in General Aviation Lost Procedures,"Pilots, students and orienteers completed three tasks in which they imagined that they were lost. For each task, participants were provided with a map and instructed to select one of three provided features to help them decide if they were at a certain (incorrect) location. One feature was unique to the correct location; the other two features were consistent with locations in both the incorrect location and the correct location. The unique feature was therefore the 'correct' choice to make. Only orienteers chose the unique feature at a rate significantly higher than chance; all other groups performed either at or worse than expected by chance. Attempts to increase the rate of disconfirming choices were largely ineffective. Findings suggest that when they are lost, both pilots and psychology students, but not orienteers, adopt a confirmatory approach to ascertain their location, which may put pilots who are already lost at even greater risk.

Pilots were directly affected by these events though it is too early to comprehend the specific psychological and occupational repercussions. While psychologists have written much on the selection of commercial and military aircrew, surprisingly little has been published on the mental health of pilots. They are a unique occupational group in terms of their selection, training, lifestyle, frequent competency and medical checks, as well as the nature and changing demands placed on them. Their 'office' is normally a cramped flight deck on board an aircraft at altitudes of thousands of feet. While some aspects of their job and lifestyle appear attractive to some, their working conditions are, at worst, inhospitable and unpleasant. This paper provides an overview of current research on the mental health of pilots, gathered from a number of different fields and specialities within commercial and military aviation. The review covers their lifestyle, psychological requirements for medical certification, psychological problems amongst air crew, personality factors, disruption to personal relationships, reactions to incidents and accidents, alcohol and drug misuse, suicide by aircraft and environmental challenges. Flight crew should have easy access to psychological support; however, many pilots are distrusting of mental health professionals. Further research is needed to improve an understanding of mental health issues among pilots, especially in order to better understand the psychological impact of the terrorist attacks upon them.

773,2014,The Journal of Management Studies,Dreaming of Flying When Grounded: Occupational Identity and Occupational Fantasies of Furloughed Airline Pilots,"This article analyses the effects of job loss on the occupational identities of a group of United States pilots, laid off (or 'furloughed') twice by their employer in the decade following 9/11. Using a narrative methodology, the paper examines how the childhood dream of flying, referred to as the Phaethon dream, serves as an identity anchor that sustained their occupational identities. When the circumstances of the aviation industry (restructuring, outsourcing, and downsizing) led to extensive lay-offs, this identity anchor functioned in two contrasting ways. Some pilots moved on to retrain and start new careers, without abandoning their occupational identities or relinquishing the dream of flying. Another group of pilots, however, were stuck in occupational limbo waiting to be recalled by their employer, unwilling to forsake this dream and refusing to contemplate a move that would decisively take them out of their pilot seats. The paper's contribution lies in theorizing how a dream originating in childhood, linked to a long-standing archetype of flying and subsequently hardened into a shared occupational fantasy, acts as an identity anchor and how this shapes responses to the trauma of job loss. The paper concludes by linking the Phaethon dream to its mythological counterpart in order to highlight its enduring, shared, and unconscious character.","This article analyses the effects of job loss on the occupational identities of a group of United States pilots, laid off (or 'furloughed') twice by their employer in the decade following 9/11.

776,2004,International Journal of Human - Computer Interaction,Overview of the DARPA augmented cognition technical integration experiment,"The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency Augmented Cognition program is developing innovative technologies that will transform human-computer interactions by making information systems adapt to the changing capabilities and limitations of the user. The first phase of the Augmented Cognition program was to empirically assess the ability of various psychophysiological measures to identify changes in human cognitive activity during task performance in real time. This overview describes the empirical results of a Technical Integration Experiment involving the evaluation of 20 psychophysiological measures from 11 different research groups, including functional Near Infrared imaging, continuous and event-related electrical encephalography, pupil dilation, mouse pressure, body posture, heart rate, and galvanic skin response. These ""cognitive state gauges"" were evaluated on a common, quasi-realistic, military command and control task called the Warship Commander Task. Participants monitored aircraft on a geographical display for their levels of threat and responded to the threatening ones, as they simultaneously monitored ship communications for ship status information. The task involves a combination of perceptual, motor, spatial, auditory, verbal, memory, and decision-making processing. Task load was manipulated by changing the quantity and types of aircraft appearing throughout the primary task and by varying the presence or absence of the secondary verbal-memory task.

779,2022,Ergonomics,Psychological distress in Spanish airline pilots during the aviation crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and psychometric analysis of the 12-item general health questionnaire,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress of Spanish airline pilots, a group of professionals undergoing an unprecedented work situation as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. To do so, we administered the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). A total of 342 questionnaires were obtained, with the largest respondent age group being 41–50 years. The psychometric properties of the instrument were also evaluated, with an exploratory factor analysis revealing a unidimensional structure that explained 59.23% of the variance. The total score on the standard GHQ-12 was 4.54 ± 3.31 very close to the cut-off point established to determine psychological distress. The score increased among those unemployed and was also higher among pilots on furlough compared to those whose work situation was relatively normal. Furthermore, the reliability measured by the total Cronbach's alpha was above 0.8 of each across all employment status considered. These results show the desirability of conducting periodic psychological distress assessments of pilots so that effective measures can be implemented to ensure their psychological and socio-emotional well-being. Practitioner summary: This article evaluates psychological distress in a group of professionals that has received scant attention in the field. Moreover, it does so against the background of an atypical situation, evaluating the psychological distress suffered by pilots in different employment categories during the current severe crisis in the aviation sector.Abbreviations: CFI: comparative fit index; COPAC: Official College of Commercial Aviation Pilots; ECA: European Cockpit Association; EFA: exploratory factor analysis; GHQ-12: general health questionnaire-12; IATA: International Air Transport Association; KMO: Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test; PA: optimal implementation of parallel analysis; ULS: unweighted least squares","The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress of Spanish airline pilots, a group of professionals undergoing an unprecedented work situation as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

780,2004,"Gender, Work and Organization",The Impact of Human Factors on Ab Initio Pilot Training,"This article examines critically the power effects of a branch of psychology called Human Factors within the context of commercial aviation. A review of the aviation literature highlights the significance of Human Factors and its relevance to the recruitment and training of ab initio pilots. However, research in the field is criticized for failing to account for existing power relations and the potential effects of a new discursive format. This article uses the concept of discourse associated with Michel Foucault to analyse empirical data from interviews with individuals involved in ab initio pilot training at a European flying college. The analysis illustrates how staff at the training college use the rhetoric of Human Factors to enhance their own contribution and status, without fundamentally changing existing practices. Although this reinforces existing power relations, the Human Factors discourse also potentially empowers a different set of management employees. By illustrating the conflicting values and interests of two sets of managers and trainers at the college, the article is able to demonstrate the negative effects of the new discursive format on male ab initio pilots. It also discusses attitudes to female pilots, contributing to the debate about the ability of management discourses to promote gender equality within commercial organizations.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the institutional data collected by the airline on their pilots related to this training in automated flight control. A 30-item knowledge assessment instrument was developed for this descriptive study. In addition, data were gathered on the learning strategy preferences of the pilots using ATLAS. Responses from 321 were secured through a random sampling of the airline's pilots.  This was not a study about the competency of the pilots. Rather, it was an assessment of the current knowledge level of the pilots related to their needs for training related to AFC. For the 30 items in the knowledge assessment, the median number of correct responses was 22 (72%). The 30 items in the knowledge assessment instrument formed five factors:  Interpreting Information from the AFS, Managing the AFS, If-Then Situations, Declarative Knowledge, and Display Indicators. The distribution of learning strategy preferences was significantly different from the norm group for ATLAS with the groups that initiate learning activities in the cognitive domain over-represented. On both the knowledge assessment and learning strategy preferences, almost no meaningful relationships were found with selected demographic and professional variables.  Cluster analysis revealed that four distinct groups of pilots exist related to knowledge of automated flight control. Discriminant analysis indicated that the groups differed in their ability to deal with Observed Change. Those poor at dealing with Observed Change were also weak in the Need to Take Action. Those good at dealing with Observed Change were strong in either declarative knowledge or procedural knowledge.  Conclusions were drawn that: (1) the training for AFC was inadequate; (2) AFC consists of five separate factors; (3) the field of airline pilots  attracts people who initiate learning in the cognitive domain; (4) personal and professional variables do not influence learning about AFC; and (5) four distinct pilot groups exist related to learning about AFC.

786,2023,Ergonomics,Quick coherence technique facilitating commercial pilots' psychophysiological resilience to the impact of COVID-19,"This study investigates the effect of quick coherence technique (QCT) on commercial pilots' resilience to the unprecedented impact of a pandemic. Eighteen commercial pilots voluntarily participated in a 2-day training course on QCT followed by 2 months of self-regulated QCT practicing during controlled rest in the flight deck and day-to day life. There are subjective and objective assessments to evaluate the effects of QCT on commercial pilots' psychophysiological resilience. Results demonstrated that QCT training can significantly increase pilots' psychophysiological resilience thereby improving their mental/physical health, cognitive functions, emotional stability and wellness on both subjective (PSS & AWSA) and objective measures (coherence scores). Moreover, pilots who continued practicing self-regulated QCT gained the maximum benefits. Current research has identified great potential to enhance pilots' mental/physical health via QCT training. Operators can develop peer support programs for pilots to increase resilience and maintain mental and physical health using the QCT technique.

This article consequently has a starting point in the notion of 'path dependency' (Schwanen et al., 2011) and an observed 'implementation gap' (Banister and Hickman, 2013), suggesting that significant mitigation policies for transport do not emerge in the European Union because of various interlinked 'transport taboos', i.e. barriers to the design, acceptance and implementation of such transport policies that remain unaddressed as they constitute political risk. The paper argues that without addressing transport taboos, such as highly unequal individual contributions to transport volumes and emissions, social inequality of planned market-based measures, the role of lobbyism, and the various social and psychological functions of mobility, it will remain difficult to achieve significant emission reductions in passenger transport. Yet, transport taboos remain largely ignored among EU policy makers because their discussion would violate 'order', i.e. harm specific interests within neoliberal governance structures and the societal foundations and structures of transport systems built on these.","There is widespread consensus that current climate policy for passenger transportation is insufficient to achieve significant emission reductions in line with global climate stabilization goals.

789,2003,Memory & Cognition,Roles of working memory capacity and long-term working memory skill in complex task performance,"In the present research, we examined the relative roles of domain-general and domain-specific individual difference characteristics in complex cognitive task performance. Specifically, we examined the impact both of working memory (WM) capacity and of acquired skills used to encode presented information in an accessible form in long-term working memory (LTWM) on performance in a complex aviation task environment. Measures of WM capacity and LTWM skill served as performance predictors. A criterion measure of task performance was related to the predictor measures. The results indicated that an increase in LTWM skill decreases the role of WM capacity as the determinant of complex task performance, although both measures are important performance predictors. We discuss how the two distinct WM constructs coexist and interact to support complex task performance.

793,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY FORMATION IN AVIATION: INSIGHTS FROM MORAL PSYCHOLOGY,"INTRODUCTION: Current instruction and mishap diagnosis regarding vehicle operation generally overlooks the moral psychology of professional ethical development. Yet, higher scores on measures of ethical development correlate positively to mishap reduction in fields such as medicine. ""Mitigating Mishaps"" (abbreviated ""M2"") research seeks to establish the feasibility of applying professional ethics education to the transportation domain prior to development of a long-term loss-mitigation campaign designed for adoption by the training and operational cultures. METHODS: Initially, a Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) is administered and validated with experienced aviation practitioners. In conjunction with the mishap record and case-based methodology from other professions, BARS results are incorporated into simulator-scenarios. After a brief screening flight to eliminate participants unable to pass typical check rides, subjects encounter scenarios and scores are recorded on adapted measures of professional ethical development. Participants are divided into three groups: experimental group 1 (receiving educational intervention stressing professionalethical development); experimental group 2 (receiving a traditional Aeronautical Decision Making class) and control. Post-test scenario assesses differences in development. RESULTS: Unavailable at this time. Protocol has just passed IRB. Expect the survey results to be available by conference time. Some simulator results may be available as well. DISCUSSION: The project will use an adapted version of the University of MN's ""Four Component Model"" (FCM) of ethical development for diagnostics, gap analysis, and scoring. The social science fundamentals underlying the project are well established. Work from the Center for the Study of Ethical Development at the University of MN, professional ethics education in other fields, the principal investigator's foregoing research and original research with active pilots form the basis for part of the research. Research will be used to inform development of a theory of professional ethics for aviation.","INTRODUCTION: Current instruction and mishap diagnosis regarding vehicle operation generally overlooks the moral psychology of professional ethical development.

795,2008,Applied Cognitive Psychology,Finding the right case: the role of predictive features in memory for aviation accidents,"Three experiments examined the role of story structure in memory for written aviation accident reports by both pilots and nonpilots. Accident reports follow a standard format providing setting, complication, decision and outcome information. Following the 'predictive features' model, it was hypothesized that expertise would facilitate recall, and that pilots would recall most effectively with the complication feature. Pilot and nonpilot participants read and recalled 4 (Experiment 1) or 8 (Experiment 2) accident reports. With four cases, pilots recalled more than nonpilots, but no difference was found with eight cases. A primacy effect for pattern of recall was found in Experiment 1 with the setting and complication features most effective in triggering case recall. When task difficulty was increased (Experiment 2), the complication feature alone was the most effective. In Experiment 3, we manipulated text structure and found that complication and decision features were better recognized than setting or outcome features by nonpilots. The finding across three studies that the complication feature was consistently the most effective for retrieving aviation accident reports supports the 'predictive features' model.

796,2017,International Emergency Nursing,The helicopter as a caring context: Experiences of people suffering trauma,"Introduction: When emergency medical services (EMS) are needed, the choice of transport depends on several factors. These may include the patient's medical condition, transport accessibility to the accident site and the receiving hospital's resources. Emergency care research is advancing, but little is known about the patient's perspective of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS). Aim: The aim of this study was to describe trauma patients' experiences of HEMS. Method: Thirteen persons (ages 21-76) were interviewed using an interview guide. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Findings: The analysis resulted in three themes: Being distraught and dazed by the event - patients experienced shock and tension, as well as feelings of curiosity and excitement. Being comforted by the caregivers - as the caregivers were present and attentive, they had no need for relatives in the helicopter. Being safe in a restricted environment - the participants' injuries were taken seriously and the caregivers displayed effective teamwork. Conclusion: For trauma patients to be taken seriously and treated as 4worst cases' enables them to trust their caregivers and 'hand themselves over' to their care. HEMS provide additional advantageous circumstances, such as being the sole patient and having proximity to a small, professional team.","Introduction: When emergency medical services (EMS) are needed, the choice of transport depends on several factors.

This paper presents a qualitative study of airline flight safety investigators. The interpretive processes, knowledge, and assumptions underlying risk identification in this setting were examined. The findings suggest that risks were initially identified through an interpretive process of finding gaps or inadequacies in investigators' current knowledge. Investigators engaged in interpretive processes that aimed to construct small moments of doubt, where current knowledge was found to be questionable or suspect in some way. These interpretive processes were underpinned by assumptions that organizational knowledge was inherently limited, partial, and fallible. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to theories of organizational sensemaking, decision-making, and expertise, and practices of risk management.

In the supine position (subject's yaw plane coinciding with the plane of gondola displacement) the indicated displacement was negligible (-0.3±4.8°).Since the canal system is most responsive to stimuli in yaw, these findings are difficult to explain by bottom-up models. Rather, the motion pattern during acceleration would be recognized as a familiar or meaningful whole (entering a co-ordinated turn) only when the subject is upright. Presumably, the degree of familiarity is reflected in the subject's ability to discern and estimate a single stimulus component. Findings are discussed in connection with human factors in aviation and the principles of Gestalt psychology.CONCLUSIONSince the canal system is most responsive to stimuli in yaw, these findings are difficult to explain by bottom-up models.

799,2012,"Dissertation Abstracts International, B: Sciences and Engineering",The effect of conative and affective traits on the development of occupational expertise of civilian Department of Defense scientists and engineers,"One of the roles of an engineering manager is to manage and develop expertise within the workforce. To this end, effective knowledge worker management requires insight into psychology and how it relates to the development of expertise. Modern psychology theory identifies three modes of mental function: cognition, affect, and conation. This research examines the role of affect and conation in the development of expertise. Expert theorists have assembled a strong body of evidence which suggests that superior achievement depends on adaptation resulting from sustained purposeful engagement. A substantial amount of research is devoted to the role of cognition in enabling expert performance. However, conation and affect are also hypothesized to be influential factors, as they determine the motivation and approach of the individual towards continuous development. A survey instrument was compiled, consisting of a set of conative and affective traits hypothesized to influence expertise development and a construct representing expertise. The survey was distributed within a large, federally-funded research and development laboratory which operates in the aviation and aerospace industry, producing a total of 541 responses. The structural equation modeling (SEM) statistical method was utilized to model and analyze the relationship between conative and affective traits and the development of occupational expertise. The findings of this research support the hypothesis that conative and affective traits are influential during expertise development. The dissertation results indicate that positive achievement orientation holds a strong, positive influence on expertise development. The mastery goal type coupled with the approach goal posture is the only goal orientation which positively influences expertise development. Work engagement holds a positive influence on expertise development. Expertise theorists hypothesize that expert-level technical performance is achievable for any individual with normal cognitive ability. Unfortunately, the reality is that only a small segment of knowledge workers currently approach this performance threshold. If engineering managers can access even a fraction of the remaining untapped potential, the implications for society are tremendous. By understanding the role of conative and affective traits in expertise development, managers can enhance professional development infrastructure and training methods in order to better support expertise development.

803,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) IN A UNITED STATES AIR FORCE (USAF) MQ-1 PREDATOR SENSOR OPERATOR - A CASE STUDY,"INTRODUCTION: Following direct involvement in the deployment of weapons as lethal force in support of a counter-terrorism mission, an MQ-1 Predator sensor operator reported experiencing emotional distress. He was referred to a clinical psychologist for an evaluation, and subsequently received a diagnosis and treatment for PTSD. However, concerns remained regarding his suitability for further participation in operations involving lethal force. He was referred to the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine for an aeromedical evaluation to assess his overall suitability for return to his duties as a sensor operator. METHODS: The aeromedical psychiatric/clinical psychological evaluation included: approximately 8 hours of clinical interviewing, 4 hours of comprehensive computer based psychological testing of his intellectual, neuropsychological, and emotional-social disposition, as well as review of medical and mental health treatment records. His case was further reviewed by a panel of flight medicine physicians for final recommendations. RESULTS: The results of the evaluation validated the resolution of PTSD symptoms. However, it was evident the resolution of his symptoms were, in large part, due to his removal from flying status and weapons deploying RPA operations. He continued to harbor distress over his potential participation in operations that might involve lethal force. The concluding diagnosis was unsatisfactory ARMA for weapon's deploying aircrew duties, and he was recommended he return to his prior aircrew position with a non-weapon's deploying role. DISCUSSION: The psychiatric/psychological aeromedical evaluation of PTSD and suitability for returning to fly among RPA operators is a complicated issue. The results of this case study help flight medicine providers consider aeromedically relevant issues when tasked with evaluating the suitability of enlisted airmen who have internal conflicts over engaging in weapons deploying RPA operations.","INTRODUCTION: Following direct involvement in the deployment of weapons as lethal force in support of a counter-terrorism mission, an MQ-1 Predator sensor operator reported experiencing emotional distress.

At first there may be a feeling of well-being, as in the case of alcoholism, but this stage gradually and unwittingly passes into sensory and mental dullness. When the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced one third, i.e., from 160 to 110 mm. or approximately 12,500 feet, the aviator may be conscious of alterations in breathing, and a little higher muscular effort in moving, headache and Cheynes-Stokes breathing. The cyanosis may be noticeable due to the diminished arterial oxygen saturation, which at 12,500 feet may be approximately 86 per cent. Many experience a desire to sleep, and fainting is not uncommon if one continues to ascend. The upper limit of consciousness in unacclimatized man appears to be between 23,000 and 25,000 feet within short periods of exposure. ""The present study is concerned with the effects of a four-hour sojourn in a simulated high altitude of approximately 12,000 feet (low oxygen chamber) on a complex mental function, as solving problems on a slide rule. Such an investigation seemed relevent [sic] to the possible effects of oxygen want on reasoning and judgment... ""1. Three out of four subjects showed a decrease in the number of problems solved on a slide rule and an increase in errors while working in a chamber containing oxygen percentages corresponding approximately to 12,000 feet for four hours. The impairment was completely significant for one subject (Sei), only fairly reliable for two (Sha and Kne); the fourth (Mey) showed reliable improvement in work output and a decrease in errors. ""2. The increases in efficiency in solving the problems, i.e., the improvement due to practice, tended to conceal the effects of the oxygen deprivation. In view of this fact, the meaning of the decrease under anoxemia compared to the control conditions both in the number of problems completed and in frequency of errors, takes on added significance. ""3. The pulse rates were, on the average, higher during the experimental periods compared with the control ones. ""4. The differences in the blood pressure records in low oxygen compared with the control series were not marked. Two of the four subjects, however, showed a lowering in systolic blood pressure during the four-hour session similar to the drop in systolic pressure frequently observed in pilots during a long flight at high altitude. ""5. There were perceptible differences in behavior and a greater frequency of subjective ailments in the low oxygen series compared with air. The two subjects who were physically unfit experienced numerous ailments such as headaches and dizziness and they had greater difficulty in concentrating. They worked very quietly throughout all of the series. The other two subjects, who were in good physical condition, were more boisterous and talkative in the low oxygen series compared with air. ""6. The results of these experiments and the others reviewed above suggest that airmen would be benefited by inhaling oxygen at 12,000 feet or over in maintaining a higher degree of mental efficiency.

We will first discuss current issues in forecasting, making the point that we are certainly not alone having to face those issues. We will introduce some of the current factors of change through the presentation of a few examples dealing with extreme health and safety issues (volcanic ash and aviation safety), policy development and assessment (air quality prediction systems), national security issues (CBRN terrorism) and the role of Canada on the international scene (modelling used as a forensic tool to identify and possibly geolocate illegal nuclear explosions or proliferation activities). We will then discuss the added value, and the fundamental necessity, of having insight from current research in scientific fields outside of meteorology such as cognitive psychology (Doswell, J. Weather and Forecasting, vol 19, December 2004), decision-making in complex non-linear environment, man-machine interactions through synthetic environment and others in order to improve the role of human in meteorological and environmental prediction. Nowadays, we have an unprecedent capability to monitor the state of our environment, the GEOSS initiative opens the door to orders of magnitude increase in the volume of data and, thanks to supercomputing technologies, an unprecedent capability to predict its future condition. The broad range of applications of meteorological modelling tools is paving the way toward exciting synergies with other scientific disciplines. Forecasting will change and forecasters will play a critical role, different but critical. Meteorological modelling will be demystified by explaining that numerical weather prediction attempts to forecast future states of the atmosphere by concentrating on the factors that make it change. The scope of application is quite broad, but includes nuclear accidents or volcanic eruptions that could have serious and dangerous impacts on our environment and on the health and safety of Canadians at home or abroad. We will also explore how meteorological banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was ratified by Canada in 1998. The treaty is a landmark international agreement prohibiting all types of nuclear explosions for the purpose of weapons testing and requiring the state parties to prevent all such explosions at locations under their jurisdiction. Meteorological modelling tools benefit all Canadians by maintaining state-of-the-art technical expertise in Canada, providing daily predictions of the state of the canadien environment and ensuring a state of operational readiness for emergencies. Other benefits include easier monitoring of forest fires and potential increases in agricultural production by predicting the arrival of airborne pests.","Predicting the weather accurately, in the traditional sense, has been one of the factors associated with the development of safe transportation systems, of increased agricultural and silvicultural productivity and of warning systems to alert and protect citizens from extreme weather events.

The face of naval aviation is very different today than it was in 1942. Modern aviation capabilities have redefined concepts of power production, battlespace management, and the nature and speed of intelligence gathering and utilization. These changes have created new challenges and opportunities and the AEP community has evolved in response. While aviator selection remains a critical focus area, the role of the AEP community has expanded to include science and technology program management, human factors, operational neuroscience, aviation training design, system acquisition, and safety research. Experts in the AEP community have also been tapped to lead efforts in areas such as virtual environment research, biometrics, and PTSD /TBI research and development. Today's group of panelists will highlight some of the work that the AEP community is doing in these areas. A key focus of the panelists today will be on how the AEP community is actively engaged in supporting the various Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) communities meet their program and mission objectives by addressing manning considerations, designing appropriate selection tools for UAS personnel, building effective and efficient training devices, and developing common control interfaces. Panelists will also discuss how selection in the area of manned aviation has recently undergone an evolutionary change in how it is conducted and describe how advances in the area of network analysis has enabled AEPs to redefine how aviation training curriculum are evaluated and reworked. The topics discussed today highlight the essential nature of the work done by AEPs and only represent a small subset of the work done by AEPs in support of naval aviation.","The AEP community was established in October 1942 with an initial focus on aviation personnel selection. The face of naval aviation is very different today than it was in 1942. Modern aviation capabilities have redefined concepts of power production, battlespace management, and the nature and speed of intelligence gathering and utilization.","<title>AEROSPACE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE FUTURE OF NAVAL AVIATION</title> <excerpt>The AEP community was established in October 1942 with an initial focus on aviation personnel selection.

These personnel provide medical care to patients during transit to definitive care facilities and often function in austere occupational environments. In-flight and operational conditions associated with these specialties may exasperate common stresses of providing ground-based medical care, thus optimizing human performance in these providers is crucial. METHODS: Numerous mixed-method studies have been conducted by the AE/CCAT research team at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine to investigate the physical, physiological, and psychological conditions in which these providers perform. RESULTS: Medical record reviews have identified both physical and psychological risk commonalities for subsets of these populations. Survey techniques have highlighted psychological risk factors. Field-based prospective data collection techniques have been used to investigate both physical and physiological risk factors for these populations. DISCUSSION: Study findings have been briefed to key stakeholders including major command and unit leadership to inform policy.

812,2015,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,THE PSYCHOLOGY OF KILLING WITH REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT,"INTRODUCTION: Throughout history, humankind has continually moved itself further and further away from the point of physical engagement during battle, lessening the mental involvement in the act of killing. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) seem a logical ""next evolution"" of this process. However, anecdotal evidence indicates RPA aircrew are experiencing unanticipated cognitive, social, and emotional responses to killing others in combat, highlighting a lack of clear understanding regarding the actual psychological responses RPA aircrew are having to weapons engagements. The purpose of this study is to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the psychological responses RPA aircrew experience from killing. METHODS: RPA aircrew who have killed in combat will be anonymously interviewed to document their experiences and resulting social, cognitive, and emotional responses.This study analyzes human, machine, and mission independent variables for differences in psychological response. Additionally, case studies are used to provide heuristic identification of new variables and causal mechanisms. RESULTS: Ongoing-scheduled for completion in spring '15. DISCUSSION: This study begins with a hypothesis that despite the thousands of miles separating RPA aircrew from their combat engagements, RPA technology is inducing a strong psychological response. If this hypothesis is correct, the level of psychological involvement among the RPA aircrew becomes an important consideration for both the operational and medical community as the USAF continues to engage in modern warfare using this technology. If the hypothesis is proven incorrect, we must then ask if the United States is creating a generation of cold-blooded killers who have no understanding of the reality their weapon system imparts on the world.","INTRODUCTION: Throughout history, humankind has continually moved itself further and further away from the point of physical engagement during battle, lessening the mental involvement in the act of killing.

813,2017,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,A Psychiatric Formulary for Long-Duration Spaceflight,"INTRODUCTION: Behavioral health is essential for the safety, well-being, and performance of crewmembers in both human spaceflight and Antarctic exploration. Over the past five decades, psychiatric issues have been documented in orbital spaceflight. In Antarctica, literature suggests up to 5% of wintering crewmembers could meet criteria for a psychiatric illness, including mood disorders, stressor-related disorders, sleep-wake disorders, and substance-related disorders. Experience from these settings indicates that psychiatric disorders on deep space missions must be anticipated. An important part of planning for the psychological health of crewmembers is the onboard provision of psychotropic drugs. These medications have been available on orbital missions. A greater variety and supply of these drugs exist at Antarctic facilities. The size and diversity of a deep space psychiatric formulary will be greater than that provided on orbital missions. Drugs to be provisioned include anxiolytics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and hypnotics. Each drug category should include different medications, providing diverse pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and side effect profiles. The formulary itself should be rigorously controlled, given the abuse potential of some medications. In-flight treatment strategies could include psychological monitoring of well-being and early intervention for significant symptoms. Psychiatric emergencies would be treated aggressively with behavioral and pharmacological interventions to de-escalate potentially hazardous situations. On long-duration space missions, a robust psychiatric formulary could provide crewmembers autonomy and flexibility in treating a range of behavioral issues from depression to acute psychosis. This will contribute to the safety, health, and performance of crewmembers, and to mission success.Friedman E, Bui B. A psychiatric formulary for long-duration spaceflight.

It was further hypothesized, however, that environmental and cultural factors would produce differences among the groups and that these would be greater between the Asian and the two ""Western"" cultures than between the two earlier samples studied. Results showed that the two Western cultures share 56% common variance in their perceptions of stressfulness, but this changes to 35% between the New Zealand and Singapore groups and only 21% between Canada and Singapore. Although comparison of the factor structure of the stress ratings of the Singapore and New Zealand samples again confirmed a general pattern of underlying stressors related to air traffic control (which fits general occupational models of stress), it also revealed culturally specific components. The nature of these suggests that they are embedded in the context of Asian environments and cultures.

The second measure, the MicroCog: Assessment of Cognitive Functioning (MicroCog), is a neurocognitive screening device that assesses attention/mental control, memory, reasoning/calculation, spatial processing, reaction time, information processing speed, information processing accuracy, general cognitive functioning, and general cognitive proficiency. RESULTS: Using a 2-tailed Student'sT-test with Sidak adjustment, no difference was found between the U-2 (n=87) and control pilot group (n=83) on any scales on the MAB-II. However, on the MicroCog, U-2 pilots (n=93) scored significantly lower (p<.05) than the pilot control group (n=80) on scales measuring reasoning/calculation, memory, information processing accuracy, and general cognitive functioning. Even so, U-2 pilot performance on these measures was in the average range using age- and education-corrected norms. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that U-2 pilots had significantly lower scores on several cognitive measures when compared to USAF pilots who did not have hypobaric exposure, consistent with previous research on cerebral aging.

820,1995,International Journal of Aviation Psychology,Effects of jet engine noise and performance feedback on perceived workload in a monitoring task,"This study examined the effects of exposure to intermittent jet aircraft noise (70 dBA or 95 dBA maximum intensity) and knowledge of results concerning signal detections (hit-KR) on performance efficiency and perceived workload in a 40-min visual vigilance task. The noise featured a Doppler-like quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d') was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a ""floor effect"" rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload. The results provide the initial experimental demonstration that perceived workload is a sensitive measure of the effects of aircraft noise in monitoring tasks.",This study examined the effects of exposure to intermittent jet aircraft noise (70 dBA or 95 dBA maximum intensity) and knowledge of results concerning signal detections (hit-KR) on performance efficiency and perceived workload in a 40-min visual vigilance task.

In this survey of 477 pilots, it was found that a large proportion could not determine when their BAC was likely to fall below this level after drinking alcohol and could, therefore, potentially inadvertently infringe the proposed regulation. Another large proportion of pilots felt that they were safe to fly before their BAC had dropped below 0.02%, which may be indicative of a willingness to infringe the regulations. Estimates of when it was safe to fly also became more inaccurate as the amount drunk increased and varied with the type of alcoholic beverage consumed. It was also found that the conclusions drawn were heavily dependent upon the formula used to estimate BAC. This methodological problem identified has considerable implications for the study of alcohol consumption when flying.","The U.K. Civil Aviation Authority is currently proposing that a maximum BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration) limit of just 0.02% should be imposed on United Kingdom pilots.

A comparison of Antarctic medical guidelines with the selection criteria from other organizations may be instructive. Current standards and recommendations and overall philosophical approach for the screening and selection of personnel for the U.S. Antarctic Program, NASA astronauts, commercial spaceflight participants (SFP), and commercial aviation were compared. Polar deployment is long-duration with limited medical capabilities and MEDEVAC options, and participants have significant daily responsibilities. NASA selections operate under a similar paradigm. Commercial airline flights are short-duration with easier MEDEVAC/diversion, but pilots have significant responsibility. Commercial SFPs have limited responsibility during short-duration flights, although the physiologic challenge of certain suborbital flights will be taxing, and MEDEVAC from remote launch facilities will not be trivial.","Careful medical and dental screening is carried out for roughly 2,000 U.S. Antarctic participants each austral summer (October-February), with additional medical and psychological assessments for another 250 hoping to stay through the winter, when aeromedical evacuation (MEDEVAC) is all but impossible.

METHODS: The information on civil aircraft accidents that occurred during a 25-yr (1982-2006) period, including flight category, the probable cause and contributing factors of those accidents, as determined and reported by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was retrieved from the NTSB Aviation Accident Database. RESULTS: Of 61883 aviation accidents occurred from 1982 to 2006, 51086 were general aviation accidents, 3026 air taxi and commuter, 1798 air carrier, 3659 agricultural. The remaining 2314 accidents were from other flight categories. Physiological/medical factors were determined by the National Transportation Safety Board to be the cause/finding 2704 times in 2367 accidents. Some accidents have been related with more than one physiological/medical factor. Of 2367 accidents, 2135 were general aviation accidents, 105 air taxi and commuter, 47 air carrier, and 48 agricultural flight accidents.

In this study, we examined the relationships of anger experience and expression to stress indices during daily living and in response to military survival training in 45 men. Methods: Prior to participation in survival training, subjects completed self-report measures of perceived stress and anger. The revised Impact of Event Scale was then administered 24 h after the conclusion of training. Results: As expected, outward anger expression was positively associated with perceived stress during free living (P < 0.0125). Outward anger expression, inward anger expression, and angry temperament then combined to account for 25% of the variance in psychological impact of a stressful mock-captivity challenge. Conclusion: Anger characteristics are associated with human stress endpoints, both during daily living and in response to an ecologically valid stressor. These findings may assist in the prevention and treatment of operational stress reactions.","A better understanding of individual differences in the human stress response may enhance prevention and treatment of operational stress reactions.

Idaho youth (middle/high school students) participated in four twoday drone workshops in locations across Idaho. Although drone applications are prevalent in many civil operations, including emergency response, hazard monitoring, delivery services, transportation, precision agriculture, public safety, and more, STEM workforce development programs are limited. The iDrone program, an informal STEM activity, was developed to introduce and apply STEM concepts packaged in a large dose of imagination, excitement, and teamwork sprit to inspire the future Idaho STEM workforce. The hands-on drone workshops integrated computer science, technology, engineering, and STEM career education. Students worked in groups to build, program, and fly drones and learned federal regulations and safety guidelines. The students also interacted with local professionals who use drones in their work and were introduced to a variety of drone research applications. Throughout the workshops, the students also shared and explored their own creative ideas for future drone applications and technologies. The preliminary results from student surveys demonstrate that iDrone can improve the preparedness of Idaho youth for college and careers in STEM fields. The developed iDrone curriculum module can be easily transferred and employed to promote a STEM pipeline broadly for K-12 education as well as for continuing education units (CEU) programs, undergraduate curriculums (iDrone X), and for graduate students and professionals (iDrone Pro) in years to come.","The Idaho Drone League (iDrone) was launched to inspire the next generation's workforce through engagement with STEM research and education.

Flight diversion due to medical emergency transport incurs a significant financial and legal cost. An aging population combined with the increasing mobility of people with acute and chronic illnesses could make an increase in the frequency of in-flight medical events aboard commercial aircraft likely. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of each type of in-flight medical illness, the appropriateness of medical equipment in flight, which factors lead to aircraft diversion, and which factors affect the suitability of the decision to divert. METHODS: A review of in-flight medical emergencies reported by six airline s from 2006 to 2013 including (8 years) was done. The frequency of aircraft diversion was related to finding fault and medical assistance provided. The suitability of the decision to divert was determined as a function of hospital admission rates. RESULTS: Over the 8 years, 186.3 million passengers traveled domestic and international and there were 525 medical emergencies and 35 (6.7%) diversions. During this period there were 6 deaths recorded, which is a rate of 1 per 30,550,000 passengers and 0.032 deaths per 1 million passengers DISCUSSION: Medical conditions most commonly leading to diversion were cardiac, chest pain, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal, faint, neurological and psychological..

In addition t0 loss of consciousness and amnesia for approximately 30 minutes, he complained of mental slowing, attention and memory deficits. After he witnessed the killing of his troops, he began to experience irritability, frustration, grief, sleep disturbance, increased drinking, and guilt. Additional problems included chronic pain and untreated moderate sleep apnea. This officer was subsequently treated for adjustment reaction and/or posttraumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing was generally in the average or above range. However, subtle cognitive deficits were suggestive of mild post-concussive problems that did not impact his daily functioning. Emotionally, the commander was judged to be highly resilient and benefitted from counseling and rehabilitation.

833,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO PHOBIC ANXIETY IN PEOPLE WITH AVIOPHOBIA,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between physiological and subjective responses in phobic subjects remains unclear. Phobics are often considered to have a heightened physiological response or a heightened perception of a normal physiological response. In this study, we examined both subjective measures of anxiety and autonomic responses (heart rate [HR] and cardiac vagal activity) to stimulated flight stimuli in a cohort (127 individuals) who presented for fear-of-flying therapy at a specialized treatment centre. The control group comprised 36 individuals without Aviophobia. We found a large increase in subjective distress during exposure to simulated flight stimuli in the Phobics but no change in this parameter in the controls. In contrast, the physiological responses of both groups were indistinguishable. However, for the phobic cohort, increases in subjective fear during exposure were coupled to heart rate [HR] and cardiac vagal reactivity. In contrast to predictions from the psychological perspective, anxiety sensitivity did not modulate this coupling. We conclude that subjective fear and objective (i.e. autonomic) responses are only modestly correlated during exposure to simulated flight conditions. However, one limitation of our study is the use of flight simulation as a means of generating phobic stimuli.","INTRODUCTION: The relationship between physiological and subjective responses in phobic subjects remains unclear.

Testing was accomplished during the evening and early morning hours, between 1630 hours and 0230 hours. Therefore, fatigue stemming from an extended work period and a disrupted work/rest cycle was also part of the study design. Data were collected on the following: cognitive and psychomotor effects, affective state changes, temperature, serum drug levels, and side effects. The drugs of interest, granisetron and ondansetron, were extremely well tolerated, with no obvious side effects when compared to the placebo condition. Two of five cognitive tests detected a positive control effect and nearly all of the measurement instruments demonstrated a general fatigue effect, independent of the drug. There was no evidence of any cognitive, psychomotor or subjective state changes caused by either granisetron or ondansetron.

The interview covered the effect of grounding for more than 30 d, motivation to fly, health decrements due to aircraft design, teamwork difficulties and blocks to success, career demands, combat and prisoner of war (POW) concerns, stress and coping styles, flying goals, and family/health concerns. There were 114 (64 male and 50 female) pilots who participated in the study. Results: The majority of male pilots interviewed asserted that they would be more protective of a woman in combat than a man and were concerned about their reaction to a female POW. Many women were concerned about being used to exploit men in a POW camp. The majority of pilots believed women were well integrated into their squadrons. Those interviewed reported that the squadron members with the most difficulty dealing with women were older males, including enlisted crew and some commanders.","Background: Identification of stresses of mixed-gender squadrons, attention to the psychological concerns of pilots in combat, and recognition of the difficulties of balancing a career and family are important in today's United States Air Force (USAF).

The current study examined associations between several types of environmental risk factors and PLEs in school-age children, whether these associations were specific to PLEs or generalized to other psychopathology, and examined possible neural mechanisms for significant associations.MethodThe current study used cross-sectional data from 10,328 children 9–10 years old from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Hierarchical linear models examined associations between PLEs and geocoded environmental risk factors and whether associations generalized to internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Mediation models examined evidence of structural magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities (eg, intracranial volume) potentially mediating associations between PLEs and environmental risk factors.ResultsSpecific types of environmental risk factors, namely, measures of urbanicity (eg, drug offense exposure, less perception of neighborhood safety), deprivation (eg, overall deprivation, poverty rate), and lead exposure risk, were associated with PLEs. These associations showed evidence of stronger associations with PLEs than internalizing/externalizing symptoms (especially overall deprivation, poverty, drug offense exposure, and lead exposure risk). There was evidence that brain volume mediated between 11% and 25% of associations of poverty, perception of neighborhood safety, and lead exposure risk with PLEs.ConclusionAlthough in the context of cross-sectional analyses, this evidence is consistent with neural measures partially mediating the association between PLEs and environmental exposures. This study also replicated and extended recent findings of associations between PLEs and environmental exposures, finding evidence for specific associations with correlates of urbanicity, deprivation, and lead exposure risk.","ObjectiveResearch implicates environmental risk factors, including correlates of urbanicity, deprivation, and environmental toxins, in psychotic-like experiences (PLEs).

841,2002,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,Using model checking to help discover mode confusions and other automation surprises,"Automation surprises occur when an automated system behaves differently than its operator expects. If the actual system behavior and the operator's 'mental model' are both described as finite state transition systems, then mechanized techniques known as 'model checking' can be used automatically to discover any scenarios that cause the behaviors of the two descriptions to diverge from one another. These scenarios identify potential surprises and pinpoint areas where design changes, or revisions to training materials or procedures, should be considered. The mental models can be suggested by human factors experts, or can be derived from training materials, or can express simple requirements for 'consistent' behavior. The approach is demonstrated by applying the Muroe state exploration system to a 'kill-the-capture' surprise in the MD-88 autopilot. This approach does not supplant the contributions of those working in human factors and aviation psychology, but rather provides them with a tool to examine properties of their models using mechanized calculation. These calculations can be used to explore the consequences of alternative designs and cues, and of systematic operator error, and to assess the cognitive complexity of designs. The description of model checking is tutorial and is hoped to be accessible to those from the human factors community to whom this technology may be new.","Automation surprises occur when an automated system behaves differently than its operator expects.

A thin stomach, devoid of fat, and lower limbs which are just like the upper ones in character. In the average values for the measurements in males, the way the weight of the body lags behind the length, and the chest measurement behind the hip measurements, stands out clearly. ""The athletic type is recognized by the strong development of the skeleton, the musculature and also the skin; a middle sized to tall man, with particularly wide projecting shoulders, a superb chest, a firm stomach and a trunk which tapers in its lower region, so that the pelvis and the magnificent legs sometimes seem almost graceful compared with the size of the upper limbs and particularly the hypertrophied shoulders. ""The pyknic type, in the height of its perfection in middle age, is characterized by the pronounced peripheral development of the body cavities (head, breast and stomach), and a tendency to a distribution of fat about the trunk, with a more graceful construction of the motor apparatus (shoulders and extremities). The rough impression in well developed cases is very distinctive: middle height, rounded figure, a soft, broad face on a short, massive neck, sitting between the shoulders; the magnificent fat paunch protrudes from the deep vaulted chest which broadens out towards the lower part of the body. The limbs are soft, rather short and wide, while the joints of the hands are often slim and almost elegantly formed. ""The dysplastics are not one particular type but a series of small groups differing very much among themselves, of which any one group contains only a few members. In this group we place such forms of growth as vary markedly from the average and commonest form of the type in question and which impress the laity as rare, surprising, and ugly... ""No knowledge of those who failed physically can be had, but of a group of 540 who entered training [at the U.S. Army Primary Flying School (Randolph Field)] we find them divided as follows: Athletic 58.88 per cent, asthenic type 32.96 per cent, pyknic type 6.66 per cent and dysplastic types 1.48 per cent. ""Physical standards for entrance are high and that will account for the preponderance of the athletic type. Dysplastics and pyknics not only fall under the physical requirements but it must be remembered that they are relatively fewer in number as we check on any large group of individuals... ""The most prevalent alloy, or mixtures of body types, in our pilots is of the asthenic and athletic groups and somewhere in these two types and their mixtures can be found the ideal pilot. His special adaptability, however, will not depend so much upon depth of chest and muscular development as it will upon coordination and other neurological and psychological elements contained within his particular body type, be it athletic, asthenic, pyknic or dysplastic"" (3).","Seventy-Five Years Ago in July 1938 Picking the ideal aviator by body type (U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Field, TX): ""Kretschmer, in his study of 'Physique and Character,' has found four ever recurring principal types of physique in his clinical material which he has designated 'asthenic,' 'pyknic,' 'athletic' and 'dysplastic' ""The asthenic is described as a lean, narrowly built man, who looks taller than he really is, with a skin poor in secretion and blood, with narrow shoulders, from which hang lean arms with thin muscles, and delicately boned hands; a long, narrow flat chest, on which we can count the ribs, with a sharp rib-angle.

Participants listened to, repeated, and responded to simulated air-traffic controller messages (in English) under conditions of low and high workload. In the high workload condition, participants performed a concurrent arithmetic task while repeating the messages. The dependent variables were message repetition accuracy and speech production (accentedness, comprehensibility, fluency, as perceived by 10 native-English-speaking raters). The native English speaker group repeated messages more accurately than both L2 groups, and the low-proficiency group repeated messages less accurately in the high workload condition than in the low workload condition. The native speaker and the low-proficiency groups were perceived as less fluent in the high than in the low workload condition, and only the low-proficiency group's speech was perceived as more accented in the high than in the low workload condition.

First, the concept of “risky pilots” is discussed, and the existence of “risky pilots” is verified using a percentage analysis of flight exceedance events. Second, three psychological risk elements for pilots are investigated using an implementation of psychological scales, and the exceedance behaviors of risky pilots are analyzed based on real flight data. Finally, correlation and cluster analyses are used to study the influence of psychological risk elements on the exceedance behaviors of airline transport pilots and their operational performance. The results indicate that approximately one‐third of pilots are more prone to exceedance events than other pilots. A moderate positive linear correlation (R [44] = 0.400; p < .05) existed between hazardous attitudes and severe exceedance rates. For pilots with a high level of risk psychology, 86%of their flights were considered “poor” operational performance level. Finally, it is concluded that hazardous attitude is a psychological risk element that has significant negative effects on severe exceedance behaviors of pilots. In addition, the flight operation performance levels of pilots were also affected by the psychological risk level. Furthermore, it is suggested that special training to improve risky hazardous attitudes of pilots should be conducted for the purpose of reducing exceedance behaviors and improving flight performance.

The participants were 171 active duty F-15 A/C pilots who completed a test battery representative of various psychological constructs proposed or demonstrated to be valid for the prediction of performance in a wide variety of military and civilian jobs. These predictors encompassed measures of cognitive ability, psychomotor ability, and personality. Supervisor and peer ratings of SA were collected. Supervisors and peers showed substantial agreement on the SA ratings of the pilots. The first unrotated principle component extracted from the supervisor and peer ratings accounted for 92.5% of the variability of ratings. The unrotated first principal component served as the SA criterion. Flying experience measured in number of F-15 hours was the best predictor of SA. After controlling for the effects of F-15 flying hours, the measures of general cognitive ability based on working memory, spatial reasoning, and divided attention were found to be predictive of SA.

The herein presented methodology and measurement equipment were developed and tested in numerous terrestrial and space experiments using a simulation of a spacecraft docking on a space station. However, in this study the method was applied to a comparable terrestrial task-the flight simulator test (FST) used in the DLR selection procedure for ab initio pilot applicants for passenger airlines. This provided a large amount of data for a statistical verification of the space methodology. For the evaluation of the strain level of applicants during the FST psychophysiological measurements were used to construct a ''psychophysiological arousal vector'' (PAV) which is sensitive to various individual reaction patterns of the autonomic nervous system to mental load. Its changes and increases will be interpreted as ''strain''. In the first evaluation study, 614 subjects were analyzed. The subjects first underwent a calibration procedure for the assessment of their autonomic outlet type (AOT) and on the following day they performed the FST, which included three tasks and was evaluated by instructors applying well-established and standardized rating scales. This new method will possibly promote a wide range of other future applications in aviation and space psychology.","For the evaluation of an operator's skill reliability indicators of work quality as well as of psychophysiological states during the work have to be considered.

856,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",AEROSPACE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY IN A COIN CONTEXT,"INTRODUCTION: Over the last decade, as a result of US engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States Military has had to relearn how to conduct counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. Rather than fight conventional state on state wars, the US military has found itself transitioning to a focus on conducting irregular warfare. The conduct of COIN operations puts coalition personnel in close contact with the local population. In Iraq and Afghanistan, coalition forces have constantly found themselves interacting closely with the Iraqi and Afghan population. In such a context, a deep understanding of the dynamics of the local population is key to success of any COIN operation. In response to the needs of COIN practitioners, the Office of Naval Research has created a Social, Cultural and Behavioral Sciences Program that is designed to help coalition personnel function more effectively. This program helps coalition forces by developing approaches to help forces better understand the culturally, ethnically, and historically, diverse societies they operate within. The Aerospace Experimental Psychology (AEP) community contributes to the Social, Cultural, and Behavioral Sciences Program in a number of ways. For example, the US Military's COIN manual notes that development of trust between coalition forces and the local populace is critical and that practitioners of COIN should work hard to establish trust between forces and the populace. Recent research by AEPs is examining techniques designed to enhance the trustworthiness of COIN practitioners. This research has examined how trustworthiness can be enhanced across ingroup-outgroup lines, even when certain outgroups are seriously disliked by an ingroup. Future research is planned which will examine whether the techniques examined by AEP researchers are effective at repairing trust lost as a result of betrayal.","INTRODUCTION: Over the last decade, as a result of US engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States Military has had to relearn how to conduct counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.

857,2009,Human Factors,Predicting Pilots' Risk-Taking Behavior Through an Implicit Association Test,"Objective: The Implicit Association Test (IAT), in combination with a battery of additional psychometric tests, was employed to examine the accuracy with which it predicts pilots' risk-taking behavior. Background: Risk management is an integral part of piloting. Many factors affect pilots' risk management, including individual differences. Therefore, employing a unique methodology from social cognition, the present study examined the influence of attitude, as measured implicitly through the IAT, personality, and flight experience variables on pilots' risk-taking behavior. Method: In addition to a simulated flight on a computer-based flight simulator, 35 pilots completed a battery of psychometric tests. Results: Among the 6 risk perception variables, 10 risk attitude variables, and 2 experience variables, only 2 variables were found to be significantly related with in-flight risk-taking behavior: everyday risk (risk perception) and the IAT effect (attitude). Of these, the IAT effect was the strongest predictor of flight behavior. Conclusion: The results indicate that implicit attitudinal measures, such as the IAT, provide a more accurate forecast of pilot behavior than do the more traditional explicit attitudinal or personality measures. Application: An implicit attitudinal measure can be proactively employed to identify pilots who are potentially more likely to engage in high-risk activities, hence permitting a more strategic approach to pilot training.","Objective: The Implicit Association Test (IAT), in combination with a battery of additional psychometric tests, was employed to examine the accuracy with which it predicts pilots' risk-taking behavior.

858,2007,Applied Ergonomics,Cognitive mismatches in the cockpit: Will they ever be a thing of the past?,"Changes in aviation over the last 30 years have dramatically affected the way that flight crews fly aircraft. The implementation and evolution of the glass cockpit, however, has happened in an almost ad hoc fashion, meaning that it does not always properly support the flight crew in carrying out their tasks. In such situations, the crew's mental model of what is happening does not always match the real state of affairs. In other words, there is a cognitive mismatch. An initial taxonomy of cognitive mismatches is defined, and the problem illustrated using an example from an aviation accident. Consideration is then given to how cognitive mismatches can be managed. A call is made for the development of an integrated cockpit architecture that takes better account of human capabilities and allows for new developments to be added to the cockpit in a more seamless manner.

In such cases, the pilot is in a high state of psychological and physiological arousal and tends to focus on one problem, while ignoring more critical information.

Seventeen pilots were assigned to the treatment and control groups matched for accumulated flight hours. The treatment group contained 4 pilots from HC-130 Hercules aircraft and 4 HH-65 Dolphin helicopter pilots; the control group contained 3 pilots of HC-130s and 6 helicopter pilots. During an initial flight, physiological data were recorded on each crewmember and an instructor pilot rated individual crew performance. Eight crewmembers were then taught to regulate their own physiological response levels using Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE). The remaining participants received no training. During a second flight, treatment participants showed significant improvement in performance (rated by the same instructor pilot as in pretests) while controls did not improve. The results indicate that AFTE management of high states of physiological arousal may improve pilot performance during emergency flying conditions.Studies have shown that autonomous mode behavior is one cause of aircraft fatalities due to pilot error.

868,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Cognitive Function During Lower Body Water Immersion and Post-Immersion Afterdrop,"Introduction: The physiological effects of immersion hypothermia and afterdrop are well-characterized, hut the psychological effects are less clear. The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in cognitive function during and after lower body water immersion. Methods: On separate mornings, nine young healthy men participated in both neutral (35 (plus-or-minus sign) 1 degree C) and cold (13 (plus-or-minus sign) 1 degree C) water immersion. Subjects rested in neutral air for 30 min followed by 60 min water immersion to the iliac crest and 1 5 min of recovery in neutral air. Rectal temperature and mean skin temperature were continuously monitored. Metabolic rate, the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) were quantified at predetermined intervals. Results: During immersion in cold water, rectal temperature was reduced, but SCWT and POMS scores were unchanged relative to baseline. Despite the reduced rectal temperature, little to no shivering was observed during immersion and metabolic rate did not change. During recovery from cold immersion, rectal temperature was further reduced by ~0.5 degree C, shivering was noted, and metabolic rate increased. Coincident with this acute afterdrop, SCWT Color-Word performance (DELTA = -4 (plus-or-minus sign) 8 vs. 7 (plus-or-minus sign) 6 correct responses) and Interference score (DELTA = -2 (plus-or-minus sign) 7 vs. 4 (plus-or-minus sign) 8) was impaired relative to recovery from neutral immersion (i.e., when core temperature and metabolic rate did not change). Conclusion: These results suggest that recovery from lower body cold water immersion elicits the afterdrop phenomenon and shivering, which together impair selective attention as measured by the SCWT.","Introduction: The physiological effects of immersion hypothermia and afterdrop are well-characterized, hut the psychological effects are less clear.

869,2009,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Cognitive function and mood during acute cold stress after extended military training and recovery,"Introduction: Acute cold stress is often accompanied by exposure to other adverse factors, such as sleep loss, under-nutrition, and psychological stress that singly and together may affect cognitive function. Methods: The effect of moderate cold stress on cognitive function was investigated in 15 male volunteers exposed to cold air (10DGC) for 4 h after they had completed an intense, 61-d regimen (U.S. Army Ranger training). The single cohort of volunteers was tested on three separate occasions: 1) immediately after completing Ranger training; 2) 2 d later when they had partially recovered from training; 3) 108 d later after full recovery. Documented training stressors included limited sleep (~4 h sleep/night), caloric deficit (~850 kcal d(-1)), intense physical activity, and psychological stress. Results: Baseline rectal temperature fell significantly due to training alone (from 36.6DG C 0.1 to 36.3DGC 0.1) and was lower still with acute cold exposure (35.9DGC 0.2). Cognitive function was affected by training alone, as indicated by significant decreases in vigilance, four-choice reaction time, pattern recognition, symbol-digit substitution, word-list learning, grammatical reasoning, and mood prior to exposure to acute cold stress. Mood states were also adversely affected, including tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion, and vigor. Acute cold exposure itself significantly degraded vigilance, overall mood, and increased tension. Discussion: Chronic multifactorial stress impaired cognitive function and mood; the addition of moderate, acute cold stress further degraded vigilance and mood. When such circumstances occur, such as during disasters or military operations, measures to prevent adverse cognitive and physiological outcomes are recommended.","Introduction: Acute cold stress is often accompanied by exposure to other adverse factors, such as sleep loss, under-nutrition, and psychological stress that singly and together may affect cognitive function.

The passengers are afraid of two different and often complementary fears: The fear of the airplane itself: turbulence, crash, engine failure. The ""fear of myself"": panic attack, heart attack, claustrophobia. From a survey of more than 2000 persons, 28.74% fly regularly, 41.26% fly occasionally, 14.45% avoid flights and 1 5.55% have never flown due to these fears. It may touch people who have been involved in an air crash (very few) or in ""accidents of life"" not related to aerial activities (avalanche, earthquake, carjacking), people who thought they were exposed to a major threat in the air (turbulence, go-around, failure of the landing gear), or people who never encountered any particular situation at all. Our purpose at the Aeronautical Anti-Stress Center at Air France is to have both general (small groups) and individualized answers. METHODS: We mix aeronautics (knowledge of the flight environment, meetings with a flight attendant and a pilot, full-flight simulator session) and psychology (individual session with a psychologist long before the course, knowledge of the human thinking, stress management, relaxation). RESULTS: Efficiency of the method gained 15 points (from 80% to 95%) by standardizing the aeronautical part, and by giving more emphasis to the psychological approach. DISCUSSION: As the demand is increasing, we have created and/or plan on creating new options: special courses for kids and teenagers, sessions in English on demand, refresh sessions (mainly about relaxation), individual coaching on-board, web-site dedicated to phobic passengers, and ""phobic flights"" for validation of cognitive behavioral therapy.","INTRODUCTION: The Aeronautical Anti-Stress Center at Air France has treated more than 3500 persons in the past 6 years.

The relationship between auditory warning sound parameters and perceived urgency is, therefore, an important topic of enquiry in aviation psychology. The present investigation examined the relationship among subjective assessments of urgency, reaction time, and brainwave activity with three auditory warning signals. Subjects performed a tracking task involving automated and manual conditions, and were presented with auditory warnings having various levels of perceived and situational urgency. Subjective assessments revealed that subjects were able to rank warnings on an urgency scale, but rankings were altered after warnings were mapped to a situational urgency scale. Reaction times differed between automated and manual tracking task conditions, and physiological data showed attentional differences in response to perceived and situational warning urgency levels. This study shows that the use of physiological measures sensitive to attention and arousal, in conjunction with behavioural and subjective measures, may lead to the design of auditory warnings that produce a sense of urgency in an operator that matches the urgency of the situation.One significant concern that pilots have about cockpit auditory warnings is that the signals presently used lack a sense of priority.

Workload conditions were created by varying time pressure and external communications requirements. Our interest was in how the pilots strategically managed or adapted to the increasing workload. We independently assessed the pilot's ranking of the priority of different discrete tasks during the approach and landing. Pilots were found to sacrifice some aspects of primary flight control as workload increased. For discrete tasks, increasing workload increased the amount of time in performing the high priority tasks, decreased the time in performing those of lowest priority, and did not affect duration of performance episodes or optimality of scheduling of tasks of any priority level. Individual differences analysis revealed that high-performing subjects scheduled discrete tasks earlier in the flight and shifted more often between different activities.","Thirty pilots flew three simulated landing approaches under conditions of low, medium, and high workload.

For airlines, the delivery of the pre-flight safety briefing prior to a commercial flight is not only an opportunity to inform passengers about the safety features on-board the aircraft they are flying, but an opportunity to positively influence their mood, and hence performance in the unlikely event of an emergency. The present research examined whether indeed the pre-flight safety briefing could be used to positively impact passengers' mood. In addition, the present research examined whether the recall of key safety messages contained within the pre-flight safety briefing was influenced by the style of briefing. Eighty-two participants were recruited for the research and divided into three groups; each group exposed to a different pre-flight cabin safety briefing video (standard, humorous, movie theme). Mood was measured prior and post safety briefing. The results revealed that pre-flight safety briefing videos can be used to manipulate passengers' mood.

There are only four humans who have flown in space for a year or longer, continuously- a significant lack of long duration mission experience. As a species, Homo sapiens have spent over 99 percent of their evolutionary history in the sensory rich natural world. During the transit portions of a NEA mission, there will be few or no planned EVAs or casual egress to break the monotony. The limited volume will curtail the amount of science performed, the primary activities will be maintenance, performance of countermeasures, and activities of daily living, resulting in low levels of stimulation. Current evidence reveals that a long term reduction in sensory input across the senses has negative consequences on neural processing, cognition and psychological well being. A NEA crew will experience a prolonged and continuous absence of social connections. Humans are a social species, and such a lack of human contact will cause profound emotional deprivation which negatively impacts cognitive and behavioral performance. Individuals experiencing prolonged isolation are higher in negative state affect, perform worse on cognitive tasks, and engage in maladaptive behaviors. Crew members will require regular and frequent contact with Earth-bound family, friends, and colleagues via transmitted audio-visual messages, and regular asynchronous private psychological conferences with mission psychologists. Temporary withdrawal is the primary means that individuals can interrupt the stress-strain cycle; thus, privacy and personal crew quarters are essential, offering one of the few opportunities crew members have to escape the monotony of their daily routine. Finally, selection of individuals with prior experience in isolated and confined environments, and those who possess the requisite personality traits, will be better able to adapt to the NEA mission environment characterized by sensory deprivation and social isolation.","INTRODUCTION: Future NEA missions will be up to 13 months in duration and occur well beyond LEO.

Use of NextGen tools requires air traffic controllers (ATCos) to use different procedures than those required to manage NextGen-unequipped aircraft, and ATCos will need to integrate the 2 skill sets when managing a sector consisting of NextGen-equipped and unequipped aircraft. The goal of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of 2 procedures in the training of student controllers to manage both equipage types. We applied a variant of the part- whole training paradigm in the present study. Using a quasi-experimental design, we trained students from 2 different labs of an internship course to manage air traffic with potential Next- Gen tools concurrent with their traditional training (whole-task group) or after they had time to learn traditional air traffic management skills (part-whole group). Participants were then tested in their ability to manage a simulated sector consisting of different percentages of NextGenequipped and unequipped aircraft at the midterm and after the final week of their internship. Results showed that it is better to train students in manual ATCo skills before introducing Next- Gen tools, unless the students are of higher aptitude. For more skilled students, simultaneously introducing NextGen and manual tools into their curriculum had little negative impact.","The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) will use advanced technologies and new concepts of operation to accommodate projected increases in air travel over the next few decades.

Fifteen male firefighters, wearing standard turnout gear which resulted in full encapsulation, performed two firefighting tasks (advancing fire hose, chopping wood) while inside the training structure. Measurements of heart rate, tympanic membrane temperature, blood lactate, perceptions of respiration, mood, perceived exertion, and thermal sensation were obtained after 8 min of advancing fire hose, and again after 8 min of chopping. Heart rate and temperature increased significantly from baseline and from advancing hose to wood chopping, whereas blood lactate increased initially after advancing the hose and remained elevated at the end of the chopping task. At the completion of the test (both tasks), mean heart rate, temperature, and blood lactate suggested that the firefighting tasks used in this study impose considerable physiological strain on firefighters. Psychophysical and psychological data mirrored the greater physiological strain following firefighting tasks performed in a hot environment while wearing full turnout gear.","This study was designed to describe the physiological, psychophysical, and psychological responses of firefighters to firefighting drills in a training structure containing live fires.

METHODS: With the objective of try to understand this phenomenon in the Portuguese airline pilots community a self-report questionnaire developed. This questionnaire was composed by socio-economic and labor questions as also psychological assessment scales: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Jenkins Sleep Scale OSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Were calculated prevalence values for fatigue (89.3%), sleep disorders (35.1%), daytime sleepiness (57.7%), anxiety (38.6%) and depression (49.6%). Splitting sample in medium and long haul pilots, the ones flying short haul presented higher levels of fatigue (p < 0.01). In medium haul pilots daytime sleepiness (p < 0.01), anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.01) came associated with fatigue and for long haul pilots was observed an association with fatigue and sleep disorders (p < 0.01), daytime sleepiness (p < 0.05), anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.01). Analyzing labor variables and possible associations with fatigue, to long haul pilots were achieved in duty hours (p < 0.05), sectors flown (p < 0.05) and night periods (p < 0.01), values corresponding to last 30 days flown. To short haul pilots the variables associated with fatigue were night of continuous work (p < 0.05) and early mornings (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Trying to comprehend the perception of fatigue due to Portuguese pilots, it was possible to realize that the majority of pilots has a good perception to his own fatigue. However, when they have the opportunity to report, they don't do it. Fatigue among pilots is one of the most pressing issues of today's aviation industry.

But information seeking occupies a central place in the pilots' work. And this activity is undergoing an important development: the transition from paper to electronic documents. A contribution to the assessment of this transition is presented here. The assessment is focused on deterioration of information access, understanding and exploitation, and their possible negative consequences in terms of reliability. The exploitation of the documentation by pilots, and particularly the information seeking activity, are described and linked to their contexts (i.e. the main tasks of flying that require information seeking). Then an users test is presented where some information-seeking tasks are evaluated in terms of cost and errors, by comparing electronic and paper documents. The results show that electronic documents provide new functions that seem useful but also that too many new functions generate difficulties. Then it seems that pilots need some time to learn how to use these new documents. Reducing attention needed to perform a task such as calculation is risky.

Human performance, endurance and resilience of the individual are still important prerequisites in a modern operational army to be successful in missions and that despite all technological progress. Fitness is a well-balanced degree of optimal but not maximum performance in all performance components, the lack of diseases, psychological and social well-being, which the individual is aware of and enables him/her to perform in a way that equals his/her best personal intentions. METHODS: From 01/2011 to 08/2012, the physical fitness of 502 asymptomatic male applicants and male candidates for flying assignments within the was examined and analyzed at the GAF IAM with the following methods: anthropometry, body composition analysis, determination of the relative and absolute maximum power of the trunk flexion and extension as well as the relationship between trunk flexors and trunk extensors and the endurance capacity. The results of applicants and candidates were compared. RESULTS: On average, the applicants were normal in weight: BMI 23.0, the body fat mass (BFM in %) was 13.4. The power ratio of the maximum power of the trunk flexors and trunk extensors was balanced with 0.7. The relative endurance capacity was at 3.1 watts/kg body weight, which corresponds to a performance capacity in the upper target range (according to Prof. Simon). The results of the ""older"" candidates were comparable to those of the applicants. DISCUSSION: The determination of the physical performance capacity in the ""pre-flying phase"" and of general strength and general endurance in particular, supplemented by the determination of the body composition, is important for a necessary basic training in case of existing deficits (candidates) and for the creation of a specific training plan adapted to strain typical in aircraft (applicants and pilots).","INTRODUCTION: Pilots of military aircraft are subject to high psychological and physical loads.

893,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY (SDT) PRINCIPLES IN AIRCRAFT MISHAP INVESTIGATION,"INTRODUCTION: A fatal USMC F/A-18C Hornet mishap resulted from controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) during night bombing practice in the Australian Outback. The pilot had recently returned to flight after over a year's absence to attend Amphibious Warfare School, followed by over six months of limited duty for recovery of a serious head injury from a traffic mishap. The squadron mishap board concluded he had been medically returned to flight status prematurely. During the usual chain of command reviews of the report, the Navy Aeromedical Medical Institute (NAMI) interjected their non-concurrence. A higher reviewing command struck the causal finding in its endorsement, leaving no identified cause of the mishap when NAMI rejected medical causes. METHODS: After an analysis of the Mishap Report, it was not clear what factors contributed to this experienced pilot's collision with the ground. Signal Detection Theory (SDT) principles were applied to the information in the report to identify a sequence of events which explained all the findings of the mishap board and identified a series of human factors which led to the fatal CFIT. RESULTS: Multiple human factors, environmental conditions, aircraft instrument deficiencies together led to compromise of the pilot's ability to discriminate critical signals for timely decision-making in the face of extreme darkness, leading to channelized attention, vestibular illusion, and visual illusion, ground proximity warning system anomaly, and instrument display deficiency unfortunately considered safe for night flight. This chain of events led to the fatal CFIT mishap and explain the mishap sequence of events. DISCUSSION: SDT is a flexible, powerful analytical tool not previously used in mishap causal determination. However, is has been used in medical testing and analysis, epidemiology, psychology, radio and radar signal detection and interpretation by humans, and by the author in safety issues and mishap investigations. A brief primer in SDT will be presented.","INTRODUCTION: A fatal USMC F/A-18C Hornet mishap resulted from controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) during night bombing practice in the Australian Outback.

Levels of plasma cortisol, norepinephrine, total protein, total lipid, lactate, and the haematocrit changed significantly across the test conditions. Plasma epinephrine, osmolality and glucose levels did not change significantly across the test conditions. Captains and copilots differed significantly in the profiles obtained for the state anxiety scores. The variables measured in this study demonstrated different profiles in response to the stressor. Conceptual and methodological problems need to be solved before an integrated psychophysiological approach to the reactions of pilots to stressors can be developed.","Seventeen Boeing 737 pilots were exposed to an acute stressor in a flight simulator: a birdstrike between V1 (velocity of aircraft on take-off run at which crew is committed to take-off regardless of any incidents occurring) and VR (velocity of aircraft at take-off).

898,2010,The American Journal of Psychology,Compatibility of motion information in two aircraft attitude displays for a tracking task,"In a conventional aircraft attitude indicator, the artificial horizon moves in the direction opposite to the pilot’s hands and the movement of the aircraft. This horizon-moving format is believed to be response–effect (R–E) incompatible. An alternative format, aircraft-moving, presents movement of the aircraft symbol that is compatible with both the pilot’s hand movements and the movement of the aircraft. In the present study, nonpilot participants performed an attitude tracking task with a horizon-moving or aircraft-moving display for 6 training sessions and 1 transfer session in which the display was switched to the other format. The participants performed the task equally well and showed similar rates of improvement with the 2 displays. However, a switch of display format degraded tracking performance, indicating that learned skills did not transfer between formats. The results of a secondary choice reaction task, performed concurrently during tracking, suggested that attention can be divided between visual and auditory modalities better with the horizon-moving display than with the aircraft-moving display. We argue that the horizon-moving format is R–E compatible, as far as the tracking task is concerned, and that the effects of display format on the secondary task may be due to different modes of spatial representation being used to monitor the formats.","In a conventional aircraft attitude indicator, the artificial horizon moves in the direction opposite to the pilot’s hands and the movement of the aircraft.

However, the application and analysis of success of these new methodologies are as yet unknown.METHODS: The military adapted the civil reverse periodization training system, composed of 6 wk and five sessions per week. For the first 3 wk soldiers performed two sessions with the objective of increasing the maximal strength of the upper and lower body muscles, and three sessions of short high-intensity interval training (HIIT). In the following 3 wk they combined two endurance HIIT and two resistance HIIT sessions with military equipment while conducting a military task.RESULTS: After the training a significant body mass index decrease was found, along with an increase in lower limb muscular strength, aerobic and anaerobic performance, resilience, stress tolerance, and psychological flexibility. Regarding the ratio of acceptance there was an increased ratio compared to previous years of 7%. In addition, married soldiers with children presented greater resilience, stress tolerance, psychological flexibility, and a higher ratio of success.DISCUSSION: Accepted soldiers presented greater psychological status and stress tolerance, highlighting the importance of the work of the unit psychologists to reinforce and monitor the psychometric profile of the soldiers as well as their intrinsic characteristics of personality and emotionality. The greater baseline physical condition and higher performance in all physical tests proves how reverse periodization training models are a great stimuli and training approach in soldiers.Tornero-Aguilera JF, Gregório Pelarigo J, Clemente-Suarez VJ.

Twenty-four pilots from the Madison County, Alabama, area performed tracking and monitoring tasks from the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (Parasuraman & Mouloua, 1987) while being presented with alarms, 75% of which were true. Pilots reacted to the alarms during one session using key presses and during another session using voice-activated responses. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to compare speed, accuracy, and frequency of primary and secondary task performances between vocal and manual alarm reactions. Results indicated that participants reacted to alarms more quickly in the manual mode than in the vocal mode; however, participants responded to a greater number of alarms vocally than manually.

Reviews of the medical-cause MORs have been previously presented for 1980-2000 and 2000-2006. METHODS: The UK CAA database of Worldwide Fatal Accidents was searched for the analysis codes indicating ""Flight Crew Human Performance - Incapacitation, medical, or ""other factors reducing crew performance"" and ""Flight Crew Human Performance -state of mind"" as a causal factor for the accident for the period 01/01/1980 to 31/12/2011. RESULTS: 31 medical-cause accidents (MCFAs) were returned for the 32-year period. There were fewer MCFAs in the last 5 years of the study period despite an increasing number of flights worldwide. The figures approximates to an average rate of one medical-cause accident per year or 1 per 100 million hours at current activity rates. Approximately half (15/31) of the accident occurred in aircraft carrying fewer than 15 passengers & crew. The commonest (24/31 =77%) causes were those related to psychiatric conditions including illicit/psychotropic drugs & alcohol. DISCUSSION: Whilst risk due to non-psychiatric conditions has been successfully reduced over the years, undeclared and undetected psychiatric conditions continue to pose a policy/regulatory challenge. Where there is performance decrement due to a psychiatric/psychological problem, or alcohol or drugs misuse in one or both of the pilots, there is a much greater threat to flight safety as it is likely that these conditions pose a safety threat throughout the flight.","INTRODUCTION: As part of an Authority Safety Management System (SMS) approach to flight safety oversight, the UK CAA has 2 multidisciplinary review groups; the Accident Analysis Group (AAG) meets to review fatal accident reports from around the world; and The High-Risk Event Analysis Team (THREAT) review all the UK's Mandatory Occurrence Reports (MORs) classified as high-risk.

The increasing need for sustaining 24-hour operations has led military and medical leaders to assess the prevalence of burnout, clinical levels of distress, and PTSD in the virtual warrior community. The 2010 study provided preliminary insights into the extent of problems among operators and prompted operational and medical interventions. This 2012 study assesses occupational health trends and seeks to identify changes that may be attributable to the interventions. Understanding the current rates of burnout, clinical distress, and PTSD is critical to strategies to maximize human performance. METHODS: This study obtained sample responses from USAF RPA (n = 1276) operators across various USAF/ANG units on standardized measures of psychological distress. Responses are compared with those from a previous RPA study (2010) and a Distributed Ground Control Station Intelligence study (2011). Analysis was performed to evaluate differences in sources and rates of stress. RESULTS: Between-group similarities and differences regarding operational stressors associated with sustaining around-the-clock operations were identified; rates of emotional exhaustion (17%-33%), clinical distress (10%-15%), and PTSD (1%-2%) were lower than expected and in comparison to previous study results from 2010. Analysis revealed various operational and demographic variables (hours worked per week, shift work, age, etc.) as factors elevating the risk for distress. DISCUSSION: This study examines the psychological health of RPA operators to assess for negative changes in their emotional disposition related to stressors in their work environment. The descriptive data regarding the emotional distress provide medical and line leadership with valuable insight into potential strategies for improving health and performance among USAF airmen supporting 24-hour intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and combat operations.","INTRODUCTION: United States Air Force (USAF) and Air National Guard (ANC) remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) operators work in a highly demanding and stressful environment containing risk factors for developing operationally significant psychological issues ie, burnout, clinical distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Although some jurisdictions require these workers to wear flotation clothing, there are concerns that, following an underwater exit in fast-moving water, increased clothing buoyancy may reduce ability to swim against the current to safely return to the ice opening. Methods: Using a simulator in a swimming pool (3.7 m deep, 28 degree C), 11 volunteers (5 women) were submersed 8 times each to test the effects from both an Upright and an Inverted position of a normal nonflotation winter jacket (Control), a flotation Jacket, a flotation Overall, and a personal inflatable vest which was inflated (Inflated Vest) on underwater horizontal swim distance. Subjects also rated exit difficulty and impedance, psychological stress, and thermal comfort. Results: Compared to Control, Jacket, and Overall, the Inflated Vest generally increased exit difficulty, escape impedance, and psychological stress, while greatly decreasing the ability to swim horizontally underwater before reaching the surface (Control, 6.1 m; Jacket, 5.0 m; Overall, 3.4 m; and Inflated Vest only 1.4 m). Swim distance with the Overall was also significantly shorter than Control, but not Jacket. Discussion: Flotation clothing (either Jackets or Overalls) is recommended for vehicle travel on ice because they do not impede underwater exit from a vehicle and allow significant horizontal underwater swim distance. An inflatable vest is not recommended because inappropriate premature inflation could increase exit impedance and decreased underwater swim distance.","Background: Winter road workers, who drive heavy vehicles over ice-covered waterways, are at risk for ice failure, vehicle submersion, and subsequent drowning in frigid water.

908,1993,"Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine","Mission challenge, mental workload and performance in military aviation","In modern military aircraft, complexity of information combined with time stress creates difficulties for the pilot under combat conditions. The first step to mitigate this problem is to measure mental workload. Several methods for doing so have been proposed. In this paper we develop an analysis of mental workload as distinguished from its prior flight mission parameters (risk, challenge) and subsequent effects (mission performance). A model is developed on the basis of extensive mission data, both ground attack and fighter missions, which exhibits a dual coping process as a response to challenge and risk: emotion coping, leading to tension and decreased performance, and problem solving, leading to increased mental energy and improved performance. The model implies a selection of optimal measures for constructing an index of mental workload which is demonstrated to yield a sensitive measure of the pilot's changing mental status over the course of a period of training.","In modern military aircraft, complexity of information combined with time stress creates difficulties for the pilot under combat conditions.

909,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",DEVELOPING AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF PARTICIPANT PERFORMANCE IN LONG-DURATION BED REST STUDIES,"INTRODUCTION: Head-Down Bed Rest (HDBR) methodology has been used for over 20 years to study the effects of microgravity (Traon, Heer, Narici, Rittweger, & Vernikos, 2007). Although used primarily as an analog for studying physiological effects of spaceflight, HDBR produces psychological effects as well. Compared to the pre- and post- phases of HDBR, participants have exhibited increased levels of depression (Ishizaki et al., 2002; Styf, Hutchinson, Carlsson, & Hargens, 2001) and stress (Chouker et al., 2001) during the head-down phase. Thus, selecting participants who are capable of performing under the psychologically demanding conditions of HDBR is essential. METHODS: Candidates for participation in a NASA HDBR study are screened by a licensed clinical psychologist for the presence of psychological disorders or traits that could interfere with their successful completion of the study, and for positive characteristics that make them well-qualified to participate in a HDBR study (Seaton, Bowie, & Sipes, 2009). To validate and further improve the selection process, a standardized measure of participant performance that could be used by multiple raters was needed. Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS; Smith & Kendall, 1963) were developed through the use of the critical incident technique (CIT; Flanagan, 1954), along with traditional BARS development procedures, and the use of focus groups. These methodologies yielded 86 usable critical incidents, which were used as anchors for the scales. DISCUSSION: The scale developed, the HDBR-BARS, is the first objective outcome measure designed to assess the performance of NASA HDBR participants. Current and future bed rest participants will be rated using the HDBR-BARS, and results of the analyses will help to validate and refine the selection process. In addition, the HDBR-BARS could serve as a model for the development of outcome measures for other spaceflight analogs.","INTRODUCTION: Head-Down Bed Rest (HDBR) methodology has been used for over 20 years to study the effects of microgravity (Traon, Heer, Narici, Rittweger, & Vernikos, 2007). Although used primarily as an analog for studying physiological effects of spaceflight, HDBR produces psychological effects as well. Compared to the pre- and post- phases of HDBR, participants have exhibited increased levels of depression (Ishizaki et al, 2002; Styf, Hutchinson, Carlsson, & Hargens, 2001) and stress (Chouker et al, 2001) during the head-down phase.","<title>DEVELOPING AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF PARTICIPANT PERFORMANCE IN LONG-DURATION BED REST STUDIES</title> <excerpt>INTRODUCTION: Head-Down Bed Rest (HDBR) methodology has been used for over 20 years to study the effects of microgravity (Traon, Heer, Narici, Rittweger, & Vernikos, 2007).

Therapeutic hyperbaric chambers have been in use from the mid-20 super(th) century, yet apparently their design: has not reached their full potential and they are not compatible with current healthcare facilities design. This paper will present therapeutic hyperbaric chambers from a human-environment-machine perspective in order to highlight their specific problems and requirements, and suggest design: concepts that may improve patient satisfaction, quality of treatment, and functionality of the staff. Data were collected from a literature review, a market survey, and personal observations. Main design solutions include personal space and privacy, stress- and anxiety-reducing environments, hazard mitigation, rearrangement of seating, and personalized (user-tailored) entertainment systems. It is suggested that adopting a user-centered design rather than an engineering focus will increase satisfaction and overall 'user experience' of the patients, alleviate psychological issues, and lessen workload and improve functionality of the staff. This study could be applicable and easily adapted to other confined therapeutic environments in which patients are restrained for several hours on a regular basis in receiving treatment, such as dialysis or chemotherapy rooms, and for confined nonmedical situations such as aircrafts and rapid trains.

914,2004,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Mixed-Gender Groups: Coping Strategies and Factors of Psychological Adaptation in a Polar Environment,"The polar environment is often seen as a good analog for long-term space missions in terms of isolation and confinement. This paper focuses on the psychological adaptation of both the men and women in mixed-gender groups in the French polar station Dumont d'Urville. The first 49 expeditions to this station were composed of men only in groups of 25-30. In 2000, two women were included in the first mixed-gender wintering group, followed by five women in 2001. This study on coping strategies and psychological adaptation was included in an end-of-mission debriefing performed by a psychologist. Data were collected using a few quantitative tools and a semi-structured interview, and focused on adaptation to wintering, coping strategies, and information on interpersonal relationships. Including women in a wintering group seems to have had positive effects on the general climate of the group by reducing men's rude behavior, but it also seems to be an important stressor for both men and women when the females' average age is close to the males' because seduction behaviors appear and rivalry, frustration, and sexual harassment frequently result. The use of problem-oriented strategies helps women to adapt. There are strong arguments indicating that living in an isolated and confined environment magnifies the usual difficulties that arise in mixed-gender relationships. Difficulties may be magnified in space since the group size is smaller and the confinement more extreme. This implies the need for rigorous select-in criteria for both men and women, especially for relational criteria, and for group training after selection.",The polar environment is often seen as a good analog for long-term space missions in terms of isolation and confinement.

Our objective was to investigate the circadian profile of heart rate variability (HRV) in the context of the MarsSOO study. Methods: Before, during, and after confinement, 24-h EKG records were obtained from the six crewmembers who participated in the mission. Autonomic activity was evaluated through time and frequency domain indexes of HRV analysis. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed both by averaging hourly HRV along wake and sleep scheduled periods and by fitting a 24-h harmonic to the hourly means. Results: During confinement, wake HRV showed (mean plus or minus SE) a progressive increase in mean RR interval (from 778 plus or minus 24 ms to 916 plus or minus 42 ms), and in the amplitude (values are wavelet power coefficients) of very low (from 13.3 plus or minus 0.3 to 14.1 plus or minus 0.2) and high (from 7.8 plus or minus 0.4 to 8.3 plus or minus 0.3) frequency components. During sleep, the relative amplitude of the high frequency component of HRV decreased (from 11.8 plus or minus 1.6 to 9.4 plus or minus 1.8 normalized units). Overall, sleep-wake differences of HRV showed a progressive decrease of the relative amplitude of the high frequency component. Also, circadian HRV rhythms were dampened during confinement. Discussion: Data revealed diminished amplitude of the rest-activity pattern of the autonomic nervous system parasympathetic function. Reduced daylight exposure and mood changes could account for this observation.","Introduction: The MarsSOO project was conceived to gather knowledge about the psychological and physiological effects of living in an enclosed environment during 520 d as would be required for a real mission to Mars.

In Experiment 1, an adaptive procedure measured the minimum viewing duration necessary for 75% performance in an aircraft classification task at various nonfoveal locations. Participants' critical tracking ability was also assessed using a central attitude display. Recognition deteriorated with eccentricity, and a wide distribution of recognition and tracking abilities was found. Experiment 2 combined the tasks; recognition was designated the primary task. Dual-task measures included the change in recognition accuracy and the increase in tracking error. Individuals' recognition thresholds (Experiment 1) failed to predict their dual-task tracking performance (Experiment 2). Notably, viewers' critical tracking ability predicted their success in preserving dual-task aircraft recognition. Recognition biases favoring the upper visual field were identified; this is consistent with a biased spatial attention system. Findings are potentially relevant to situation awareness assessment and to display design.","Two experiments tested near-threshold recognition performance throughout the visual field, examined the effect of the recognition task on a concurrent attitude tracking task, and tested whether individuals' near-threshold performance would predict their dual-task performance.

The overall task environment included tracking, resource management, and multiple monitoring subtasks. Slower, more accurate monitoring and better resource management were observed when the tracking subtask was automated. Although lower workload was reported when tracking was automated, fatigue increased equally during periods of manual and automatic tracking. When participants could control workload by shifting between manual and automatic tracking, participants with 7 hr of training switched between automatic and manual tracking. Their performance during optional automation periods was superior to their performance in conditions in which only manual control or only automated control was available. The findings argue for the utility of discretionary control of automated systems.","The experiments discussed in this article addressed the influence of part-task automation on operator performance, workload, and fatigue in a multitask environment.

919,2015,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Development and Validation of the Cognition Test Battery for Spaceflight,"BACKGROUND: Sustained high-level cognitive performance is of paramount importance for the success of space missions, which involve environmental, physiological, and psychological stressors that may affect brain functions. Despite subjective symptom reports of cognitive fluctuations in spaceflight, the nature of neurobehavioral functioning in space has not been clarified. METHODS: We developed a computerized cognitive test battery (Cognition) that has sensitivity to multiple cognitive domains and was specifically designed for the high-performing astronaut population. Cognition consists of 15 unique forms of 10 neuropsychological tests that cover a range of cognitive domains, including emotion processing, spatial orientation, and risk decision making. Cognition is based on tests known to engage specific brain regions as evidenced by functional neuroimaging. Here we describe the first normative and acute total sleep deprivation data on the Cognition test battery as well as several efforts underway to establish the validity, sensitivity, feasibility, and acceptability of Cognition. RESULTS: Practice effects and test-retest variability differed substantially between the 10 Cognition tests, illustrating the importance of normative data that both reflect practice effects and differences in stimulus set difficulty in the population of interest. After one night without sleep, medium to large effect sizes were observed for 3 of the 10 tests addressing vigilant attention (Cohen's d = 1.00), cognitive throughput (d = 0.68), and abstract reasoning (d = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to providing neuroimaging-based novel information on the effects of spaceflight on a range of cognitive functions, Cognition will facilitate comparing the effects of ground-based analogues to spaceflight, increase consistency across projects, and thus enable meta-analyses.","BACKGROUND: Sustained high-level cognitive performance is of paramount importance for the success of space missions, which involve environmental, physiological, and psychological stressors that may affect brain functions.

Phobic reactions presented earlier in training, whereas marital conflicts were more prominent later in training. All phobic students were eliminated from training; 45% of all others completed training.

These latter attacks were always precipitated by head turning, usually in combination with positive G sub(z) maneuvers, and were relieved by head straightening. The anxiety symptoms were consistent with a form of panic attack, but the neurological symptoms provoked further workup. Magnetic resonance cerebral angiogram demonstrated a dominant right vertebral artery and hypoplastic left vertebral artery. All symptoms resolved once the aviator was removed from flying the aircraft. After a year of follow-up with an aviation psychiatrist, he remained asymptomatic and was reassigned to maritime patrol aircraft.

The FOF clinic has filled a need in the San Francisco Bay Area for 35 years. Using a two pronged approach, the clinic provides information delivered first-hand by professionals from inside the commercial aviation industry, as well as the psychological structure through which to make that information useful. Volunteer pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers, and maintenance workers share insider knowledge about their training and procedures. Armed with this new information, as well as key cognitive-behavioral techniques to assist them in changing their old belief systems, clients are encouraged to confront their fears on an ""orientation"" flight with other fearful flyers. Each clinic enrolls between 10-25 participants. The group therapy structure, led by a behavioral therapist, provides a supportive environment for tackling the fear of flying.

In this study, the relationship of the picture to the concepts of mental models and situation awareness (SA) is discussed. A definition of SA is proposed that suggests it is the transient contents of awareness, as structured and supported by an underlying mental model. Research on SA in air traffic control is reviewed, and it appears that insufficient work has been done to demonstrate the importance of SA for successful task performance. An experiment with air traffic control trainees is described that relates their recall of basic aircraft data during a simulation to their scores in a final exam. The results showed that students prioritized aircraft information. Those who had accurate recall of aircraft altitude and heading had better outcomes. It is suggested that trainees, in retaining information about aircraft altitude and direction of flight, maintain a minimum but adequate set of data to help anticipate impending aircraft conflicts. It is recommended that further SA research be conducted to determine its salient components for a given task.","Air traffic controllers report that they form a mental picture of aircraft in airspace to assist in their work.

929,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",AN EXAMINATION OF CURRENT LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTS OF STRESS ON HUMAN PERFORMANCE,"INTRODUCTION: Military missions and objectives require aircrew to perform in a dynamic environment. The environment is compounded at times with critical time constraints and life/death stakes. The high operational tempo has had the added effect of increasing the stress levels of aircrew with the aircrew experiencing high workload and mental fatigue. Operational, environmental, physiological, and psychological stressors all contribute to stress on aircrew. While a certain level of stress may be beneficial and is expected, too many stressors can affect an individual's performance and can negatively affect the aircrew's ability to complete mission objectives. In these environmental conditions human performance becomes increasingly important. DISCUSSION: This presentation will examine the current literature regarding the effects stress has on human performance. Anything that can hinder human performance hinders mission accomplishment. The need to be successful has not decreased, if anything human performance capability has increased due to a change in the operational objectives. Many studies on both the concept of stress and the effects of stress on human physiology, psychology, and overall performance have been conducted. Influence, both positive and negative, that stress exerts on various performance capabilities has been examined.

930,2011,International Journal of Aviation Psychology,Conceptions of Cognition for Cognitive Engineering,"Cognitive processes, cognitive psychology tells us, unfold in our heads. In contrast, several approaches in cognitive engineering argue for a shift of unit of analysis from what is going on in the heads of operators to the workings of whole socio-technical systems. This shift is sometimes presented as part of the development of a new understanding of what cognition is and where the boundaries of cognitive systems are. Cognition, it is claimed, is not just situated or embedded, but extended and distributed in the world. My main question in this article is what the practical significance is of this framing of an expanded unit of analysis in a cognitive vocabulary. I focus on possible consequences for how cognitive engineering practitioners think about function allocation in system design, and on what the relative benefits and costs are of having a common framework and vocabulary for talking about both human and technical system components. I argue for what I call an expansive but deflated conception of cognition, primarily on pragmatic grounds. In addition, I claim that the important lesson of the ""boundaries of cognition"" debate in cognitive science is the negative claim that there is not anything special about the biological boundary of the skin and skull per se, rather than some positive claim about where the boundaries of extended or distributed cognitive systems really are. I also examine the role of the concept of cognition in the theoretical frameworks of distributed cognition, joint cognitive systems (also known as cognitive system engineering), and cognitive work analysis.","Cognitive processes, cognitive psychology tells us, unfold in our heads.

931,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",ONLINE OFFLINE VOICE STRESS ANALYZER,"INTRODUCTION: Human voice contains certain infrasonic components called as microtremor and not audible to the listeners. Microtremor is present in the vocal cord and vibrates around 10 Hz frequencies during an emotionally relaxed state of the person. Recent research has indicated that when the person is in the state of psychological stress, the microtremor increases in frequency and decreases in amplitude. There is need to develop a deception tool that should be non-invasive and require no physical contact with the body of speaker. METHODS: An attempt had been made to present data for supporting the validity of the hypothesis as a measure of shift in fundamental frequency (F0). The real time acquisition of speech achieved and processed using Data Acquisition Tool Box of MATLAB software. Acquired speech was analyzed to measure the presence or absence of microtremor with frequency range from 9 Hz to 11 Hz. Algorithm has been developed to acquire speech for every 3 seconds to estimate shift in F0. The simulator was also developed for generation of pure tone of extremely low frequencies applicable in the inaudible range 1-20Hz. RESULTS: Autocorrelation function resulted to estimate the fundamental frequency (F0) of acquired speech. The research also suggests a non-invasive and remotely accessible technique to detect speech under stress. General Questions asked did not show any signs of stress and represented in the green color. When the speaker was in neutral state, graph represented the blue color. In response to the questions directly asked to human volunteers for investigation of the issue, Stress reflected in the acquired speech pattern and appeared in the red color. DISCUSSION: It is low intensity conflicts, therefore voice stress analyzer (VSA) may be modified to the rest/ tiredness status of war fighters on prolong mission. The system can also be used in the field condition to investigate/ interrogate suspected terrorist or their sympathizer or accomplices.","INTRODUCTION: Human voice contains certain infrasonic components called as microtremor and not audible to the listeners.

932,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",EFFECTS OF PUPILLARY RESPONSE DURING ACUTE NORMOBARIC HYPOXIA AND RECOVERY,"INTRODUCTION: Two antagonistic iris smooth muscle systems are innervated continuously by varying activity of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium that is expressed as pupil diameter. During acute exposure to hypoxia, there is a complex interaction among central chemoreceptor/integrators, the carotid body, and central hypoxia sensors that change many autonomic functions, and the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to maintain oxygen delivery to tissues. Fluctuations in pupil size may provide insight into metabolic/functional changes of the central nervous system (CNS) that result from hypoxic exposure. This study examined the effects of acute hypoxic stress on pupillary response and the time required for these effects to recover post-exposure. METHODS: Active duty military between age of 20 and 35 participated in the study (n=23). Pupillary measurements included three 20-sec continuous measurements collected atTime-0, 10, and 20-min during six 30-minute experimental sessions. Baseline was established prior to hypoxic exposure. Subjects breathed an air mixture equivalent to 18,000 ft for a period of 30-min followed by recovery with sea-level air mixtures. Four 30-min recovery blocks were collected after exposure (immediate, 1, 2, and 24-hrs). RESULTS: Pupil dilation atTime-0 from psychological stress/anticipation prior to the hypoxia exposure initially masked the expected hypoxia-induced pupil constriction. However, pupil size decreased continuously and became significantly reduced from Time-0 at 20-min during the hypoxia exposure (p<.001). And following the hypoxia exposure pupil diameter remained constricted when compared to baseline for over 24 hours (p<.05). DISCUSSION: The results suggested that acute normobaric hypoxia reduced pupil size and the residual effect remained for hours after exposure. The pupil dynamics observed in response to acute hypoxia exposure may indicate a neuronal metabolic depression and generalized reduction in neuronal excitability that affect cortical (e.g., prefrontal cortex) functions. The residual effects of hypoxia exposure on the CNS remain unclear and require additional investigation.","INTRODUCTION: Two antagonistic iris smooth muscle systems are innervated continuously by varying activity of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium that is expressed as pupil diameter.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a descriptive theory of decision making could be applied to pilots' decisions about whether to continue a flight into deteriorating weather. Prospect theory predicts that when situations are viewed in terms of gains, people are risk averse, but when situations are viewed in terms of losses, people are risk seeking. Computer simulated scenarios of cross-country VFR flights were presented to participants who had to decide whether they would continue with the flight. The study investigated three questions. First, do pilots normally frame such decisions in terms of gains or losses? Second, what factors are considered relevant by pilots when making such decisions? Third, can a pilot's decisions about whether to continue a flight be manipulated by the framing of the problem? We hypothesized that pilots who were encouraged to make their decision in terms of anticipated gains from their current position would make more risk-averse or cautious decisions than pilots who were concerned about minimizing past costs. Results showed that participants tended to select the gains frame rather than the losses frame as the way they would naturally consider the decision of whether to continue with the flight.","One of the most significant factors in general aviation fatalities is the continuance of visual flight rules (VFR) flight into deteriorating weather.

This double blinded, randomized trial was designed to see if the use of EANx could effectively improve cognitive performance while diving.METHODS:Eight volunteers performed two no-decompression dry dives breathing air or EANx for 20 min at 0.4 MPa. Cognitive functions were assessed with a computerized test battery, including MathProc and Ptrail. Measurements were taken before the dive, upon arrival and after 15 min at depth, upon surfacing, and at 30 min postdive. After each dive subjects were asked to identify the gas they had just breathed.RESULTS: Identification of the breathing gas was not possible on subjective assessment alone, while cognitive assessments showed significantly better performance while breathing EANx. Before the dives, breathing air, mean time to complete the task was 1795 ms for MathProc and 1905 ms for Ptrail. When arriving at depth MathProc took 1616 ms on air and 1523 ms on EANx, and Ptrail took 1318 ms on air and and 1356 ms on EANx, followed 15 min later by significant performance inhibition while breathing air during the ascent and the postdive phase, supporting the concept of late dive/postdive impairment.DISCUSSION: The results suggest that EANx could protect against decreased neuro-cognitive performance induced by inert gas narcosis.

In addition, subjective workload and mood ratings were collected. A second group of four subjects served as a control group who performed the different tasks on the same 26-d time schedule without being exposed to confinement and elevated CO sub(2). Conclusions: The study indicates that at least visuomotor performance might be affected by CO sub(2) concentrations in the ambient atmosphere as small as 1.2% if subjects are chronically exposed to these concentrations in a confined environment.

941,2004,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Mental Workload in Air Traffic Control: An Index Constructed from Field Tests,"Background: Mental workload assessment is a recurrent issue in air traffic control (ATC). Studies of ATC have used either objective aspects, i.e., numbers and distribution of aircraft, or subjective factors, such as self-imposed performance and stress levels, with mixed results. This is partly due to the difficulty in bringing together comparable data pertaining to both air traffic, with its ever-changing distribution, and judgement or quickly fluctuating psychophysiological variables. Methods: We propose a method of mental load estimation devised to take into account both objective traffic variables and the additional load imposed by subjective effects, including the seriousness of conflicts and the time-pressure for their resolution. First, we developed a traffic load index (TLI) to identify time boundaries during which additional load may occur. Then we quantified the additional load according to the air traffic situation. Results: TLI was developed from analysis of 25 h of recordings of radar control sessions involving 25 professional air traffic controllers at a major airport. Results were then compared with a simple objective index (number of aircraft) and subjective workload ratings (NASA-TLX test). The whole population (intersubjects analysis) showed a better correlation between the TLI and the self-rated workload than for the number of aircraft alone. Among the controllers who rated more than one level of workload through the TLX-test, 77.8% showed better correlation between TLI and TLX than between N and TLX (intrasubjects analysis). Conclusion: Workload estimation should integrate both objective task variables and subjective evaluations associated with them.","Background: Mental workload assessment is a recurrent issue in air traffic control (ATC).

944,2014,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine","Mission, Physical, and War Stressors' Impact on Aircrew Psychological Strain","Background: Little is known about the relative impact of the organization of missions on aircrew well-being. Using an occupational stress model we investigate a previously little studied concept of mission stressors and determine its relative impact in comparison to physical and war stressors in the prediction of four strains in deployed aircrews. Method: Questionnaires were completed by 272 deployed in-aircraft crewmembers. Three new stressors were developed for this study: mission stressors, physical stressors, and war stressors. In addition, four strains were measured: PTSD, depression, sleepiness, and nervousness. Regression analyses were used to examine the relative impact of each stressor on the four strain measures while controlling for age and occupation. Results: All three stressors played a significant role in the prediction strains with the total explained variance in the analyses ranging from 15% and 39%. Interestingly, mission stressors played the most important role in the prediction of strains possessing the largest partial eta squared in each analysis. The second most important stressor was physical stressors followed by war stressors. Conclusion: The importance of mission stressors may be because current training is designed to inoculate crewmembers to stressors such as the physical/environmental conditions and violent war actions, but there is no training or acknowledgment of the importance of dealing with mission stressors. Our findings suggest it might be beneficial for commanders to address these stressors, as it may improve short-term psychological well-being, which may ultimately impact mission success and safety.",Background: Little is known about the relative impact of the organization of missions on aircrew well-being.

945,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",ACQUIRED COLOR DEFICIENCY IN VARIOUS DISEASES,"INTRODUCTION: Most color vision tests are designed to detect hereditary color vision deficiency (CVD), an X-chromosome linked condition present in 8% of males and 0.5% of females. Yet CVD can also occur as an early sign of ocular, systemic and/or neurologic disease, often at asymptomatic, subclinical levels. Acquired CVD can also manifest from physiological stressors including altitude and hypoxia, ischemic events, certain drugs, aging, brain injury and potentially from psychological stress and/or fatigue. Our purpose is to review differences between hereditary and acquired CVD, methods of diagnosis, as well as case analyses of acquired CVD. METHODS: Similarities and differences between hereditary and acquired CVD will be reviewed followed by brief description of color vision tests including PIP, hue arrangement tests, anomaloscope, and color contrast threshold tests. Various cases of acquired CVD will be described based on retrospective record analysis. RESULTS: Record analysis revealed cases of acquired CVD in numerous conditions including central serous retinopathy, optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, and in multiple sclerosis patients' who lacked optic neuritis and visual symptoms. Unique cases of tritan CVD and the prospect that hereditary tritan CVD may be a progressive condition will be discussed. DISCUSSION: Acquired CVD can present with symptoms or at subclinical levels in various diseases and conditions. It is incumbent upon us to fully utilize sensitive methods to detect CVD as an early sign of disease or adverse function, and as an adjunctive method to monitor progression over time.","INTRODUCTION: Most color vision tests are designed to detect hereditary color vision deficiency (CVD), an X-chromosome linked condition present in 8% of males and 0.5% of females.

949,1992,,"FEDERAL TRANSFER CENTER, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA.","PURPOSE: Construction and operation of a new federal transfer center (FTC) at the Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is proposed. The FTC would be a 1,000-unit, short-term facility designed to house sentenced inmates who were being transported through the U.S. Marshals Service's National Prisoner Transportation System (NPTS). The transported inmates would include those who were recently sentenced and in transit to a designated federal correctional facility or those who were being transferred between federal correctional facilities. Rogers Airport serves as the primary hub of the Marshals Service flight network for the NPTS. Inmates from incoming flights are required to wait for two to three weeks for outgoing transportation to the appropriate facilities. The new FTC would be staffed by 225 to 250 full-time employees who would provide 24-hour supervision; it would replace the inmate holdover operation at the El Reno, Oklahoma, federal correctional institution (FCI). The new FTC would be located on the west side of Rogers Airport at the southeast corner of MacArthur Avenue and Southwest 74th Street, directly south of the Federal Aviation Administration's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center. The FTC, which would be constructed by the Oklahoma City Department of Airports and leased and operated by the Bureau of Prisons, would consist of one eight-story structure designed to contain approximately 1,000 detention units within approximately 500,000 square feet. The structure would be connected by secure jetways to transport aircraft. It would be designed to be self-contained, and would include housing units, a health unit, a kitchen, a laundry, areas for inmate services, a library, and recreational facilities. Parking for approximately 180 vehicles would be provided. The project would also include the necessary aircraft aprons and runway connections. Perimeter security provisions would be incorporated within the structure itself and would not be obvious from the exterior. Operational services would include psychology services, chaplain services, recreation and other leisure time activities, educational services, staff training, medical services, administrative systems management, case management coordination, general facilities operations, correctional services, and visitation services. Construction costs are estimated at $50 million to $80 million, to be expended over a 24-month period; annual operating costs are estimated at $10 million to $12 million. POSITIVE IMPACTS: In combination with other actions, the operations of the FTC would contribute substantially to the implementation of national criminal justice initiatives. The El Reno FCI, which is overcrowded, would be relieved, and the distance that inmates have to travel from where they are held to the airport, which is currently some 30 miles, would be lessened significantly. Construction and operating expenditures and employment would generally benefit the local economy. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Facility construction and operation would result in less than significant impacts to the immediate project site and local community; slight impacts would affect utility services, traffic and transportation movements to and from the site, and ambient noise levels and air quality. Two crossings of the eastern tributary of Cow Creek would be necessary, and up to ten acres of wetlands could be disturbed by construction activities.

952,2004,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Stress and Coping in a Week-Long Disabled Submarine Exercise,"Background: Emotional stress could impair cognitive performance and decision-making in the initial period within a disabled submarine (SUBSUNK). The aim of the present study was to explore stress reactions over time in submarine crewmembers exposed to a simulated SUBSUNK trial. Methods: There were 18 Norwegian sailors who were confined within the front section of a conventional diesel-electric submarine for 6 d 18 h complying with emergency SUBSUNK procedures. Self-reported measures of habitual coping and personality hardiness were completed before the simulation, and measures of emotional stress symptoms and quality of life were assessed daily during the exercise and at 2 wk after the exercise. Results: A repeated measures analysis of variance showed that emotional stress symptoms declined [F (6,14) = 2.76, p < 0.05], while quality of life improved over time [F (6,14) = 4.00, p < 0.01] from the first day compared with subsequent days of the experiment. Personality hardiness was negatively associated with emotional stress (r = -0.52) and lower quality of life (r = -0.47), while avoidant coping was positively associated with lower quality of life (r = 0.53) in the first 24 h of the SUBSUNK situation (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the level of emotional stress was highest in the first 24-h period, and that the level of distress was related to scores on personality hardiness and personality traits. These data have possible implications for selection and healthcare of personnel, and also suggest that crews will benefit from external help especially in the first 24 h of emergency response techniques.",Background: Emotional stress could impair cognitive performance and decision-making in the initial period within a disabled submarine (SUBSUNK).

954,2020,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Promoting Tech Transfer Between Space and Global Mental Health,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous issues in mental health benefit from technological innovation. An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors, omics, and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space.METHODS: We prepared a systematic review of studies pertaining to mental health technological innovation and space medicine.RESULTS: For Earth mental health technologies translatable to long-duration space missions, we cite several example technologies, including device-based psychotherapy and social support, conversational agents aka chatbots, and nutritional and physical activity focused mental health. Space technologies translatable to Earth mental health include remote sensing devices, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, chronotherapies, and nutritional advances.DISCUSSION: There is a rich history of space technologies informing Earth technological trends, including general health care on Earth, and vice versa. To avoid the traditional happenstance approach that results in delays, missed opportunities, and increased cost, and to improve outcomes for both Earth and space utilization of these technologies, we propose increased dialogue and training opportunities to enhance innovation and outcomes.Chang DD, Storch EA, Black L, Berk M, Pellis N, Lavretsky H, Sutton J, Ternes K, Shepanek M, Smith E, Abbott R, Eyre HA.

This study investigated psychological, social, occupational, and cultural variables which are among the most important determinants in adaptation to a one-year wintering in Antarctica for 13 international subjects. RESULTS: Our findings confirm and give further insight into the role of social (Cohesiveness, Social Support) and occupational (Implementation/Preparedness, Counterproductive Activity, Decision Latitude, and Psychological Job Demands) dimensions of adaptation to ICEs. Relationships between various social and occupational dimensions studies reflected detrimental effects ranging from decrements in cohesiveness (ICE 1, M = 4.44; ICE 7, M = 3.33), social support (ICE 2, M = 4.93; ICE 7, M = 4.28), and work performance (ICE 1, M = 4.33; ICE 6, M = 3.5), which differed across professional status and multicultural factors.

961,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",SLEEP EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR SPACEFLIGHT OPERATIONS,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep Education and Training (SET) is an evidence-based practice commonly used to help treat insomnia, and is part of NASA's countermeasure regimen for Fatigue Management. SET addresses lifestyle and habits that are maladaptive to managing stress and fatigue. This training includes addressing learned behavioral responses that may cause stress and lead to an increased sense of fatigue. While the initial cause of onset of fatigue in the individual may be no longer present, the perception and engrained anticipation of fatigue persists, and this perception can cause an exaggerated state of tension. SET, combined with relaxation training, allows the individual to unlearn the maladaptive beliefs and behaviors and replace them with routines and techniques that allow cognitive restructuring and resultant relief from stress. SET allows for elimination of unwanted ruminating thoughts and anticipatory anxiety by, for example, training the individuals to practice responses to stressful situations while in a relaxed state. As a result of SET, relaxation can be accomplished in many ways, such as progressive muscle relaxation, meditation and guided imagery. SET is not therapy, but rather the synthesis of behavioral countermeasures. SET utilizes progressive relaxation as a means of reinforcing educational and cognitive countermeasures. These countermeasures include: masking, elimination of distracting thoughts, anxiety control, split attention, cognitive restructuring and other advanced psychological techniques. SET can serve as an effective countermeasure for sleep loss in spaceflight operations.","INTRODUCTION: Sleep Education and Training (SET) is an evidence-based practice commonly used to help treat insomnia, and is part of NASA's countermeasure regimen for Fatigue Management.

An air traffic control simulator was used to manipulate traffic loads and traffic complexity. A mature stage of free flight was simulated by having controllers monitor self-separating aircraft. Four 30-min scenarios were created to combine moderate (11 aircraft) and heavy traffic loads (17 aircraft) in a 50-mile radius sector with the presence or absence of self-separating and conflicting aircraft. Conflicts (defined as a loss of separation of 5 nm laterally and 1,000 ft vertically) were indicated to the controller by the appearance of a red circle around each of the aircraft involved. A self-separation event was defined as an evasive maneuver (either altitude or speed change) made by 1 aircraft to avoid a potential conflict with another aircraft. Performance and workload measurements indicated that controllers had difficulty both in detecting conflicts and in recognizing self-separating events in a timely manner in saturated airspace. Controller mental workload also increased, as indexed both by subjective and secondary task measures.

Energetic arousal (EA), tense arousal (TA), and hedonic tone (HT) assessments were conducted by the self-reported UWIST Mood Adjective Check List (UMACL). Results: Centrifugation explained 31.6% of EA and 56.9% of TA variance. EA level increased 2 min before centrifugation and remained so until the last measurement. TA was high 2 h prior to the centrifuge run, rose sharply 2 min before centrifugation, and lowered considerably after cessation of the run. The HT level was stable throughout all measurements.

968,2015,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Cognitive Workload and Psychophysiological Parameters During Multitask Activity in Helicopter Pilots,"BACKGROUND: Helicopter pilots are involved in a complex multitask activity, implying overuse of cognitive resources, which may result in piloting task impairment or in decision-making failure. Studies usually investigate this phenomenon in well-controlled, poorly ecological situations by focusing on the correlation between physiological values and either cognitive workload or emotional state. This study aimed at jointly exploring workload induced by a realistic simulated helicopter flight mission and emotional state, as well as physiological markers. METHOD: The experiment took place in the helicopter full flight dynamic simulator. Six participants had to fly on two missions. Workload level, skin conductance, RMS-EMG, and emotional state were assessed. RESULTS: Joint analysis of psychological and physiological parameters associated with workload estimation revealed particular dynamics in each of three profiles. 1) Expert pilots showed a slight increase of measured physiological parameters associated with the increase in difficulty level. Workload estimates never reached the highest level and the emotional state for this profile only referred to positive emotions with low emotional intensity. 2) Non-Expert pilots showed increasing physiological values as the perceived workload increased. However, their emotional state referred to either positive or negative emotions, with a greater variability in emotional intensity. 3) Intermediate pilots were similar to Expert pilots regarding emotional states and similar to Non-Expert pilots regarding physiological patterns. DISCUSSION: Overall, high interindividual variability of these results highlight the complex link between physiological and psychological parameters with workload, and question whether physiology alone could predict a pilot's inability to make the right decision at the right time.

METHODS: 30 experienced flight attendants (12 male, 18 female, age 35.6 +/- 8.3 years,) flew each 2 round trips Frankfurt -Tokyo - Frankfurt with 1 or 2 day layover in Tokyo. Physiological data (HRV, RR, HR, body temperature) and psychological data (Benton d2 test, Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), sleep log, NASA task load index) were measured before, during and after flights and during the layover. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were carried out for comparison. RESULTS: No differences were found between all outbound flights from Frankfurt to Tokyo. All tests (SSS, d2, NASATLX) showed increased fatigue and a decreased performance during the return flight with only 1 day layover in Tokyo compared to a 2 day lay over. Only at the end of the inbound flight to Frankfurt with 1 day layover most of the flight attendants showed severe to very severe fatigue. DISCUSSION: The results showed a significantly increased burden for all flight attendants during a 3 day rotation eastbound from Frankfurt to Tokyo compared to a 4 day rotation. The results are similar to previous westbound studies. Therefore not the flight direction (east- or westbound) but the workload and the recovery time during layover are responsible for critically increasing fatigue. Even if a relevant flight safety issue could not be found for the flight attendants, an extended layover time is recommended from the labor-physiological view. (Contains data from the thesis of B. Stoldt).","INTRODUCTION: A stress analysis has been performed to verify differences in burdens of flight attendants comparing 3 day round trips with 4 day rotations from Frankfurt to Tokyo.

Of the 400 randomly selected Canadian controllers, 217 returned questionnaires on Type A behavior pattern and health problems. In multiple regression analyses, the incidence of health problems was predicted by specific personality traits associated with Type A behavior pattern (e.g., time urgency, job dissatisfaction, and volatility). A global measure of Type A behavior pattern alone was not found to be a useful predictor in the regression analyses. Specific personality characteristics were also better predictors of the incidence of illness than well-known risk factors, such as diet, weight, and family history of illness. The interpretation of these results is qualified by noting that correlations between variables alone do not provide sufficient evidence for causation (but nonetheless are a necessary precondition).","A national postal survey was undertaken utilizing a highly stressed occupational group, air traffic controllers.

Additionally, the applicants were graded in a simulator checkflight. On the basis of training records, the pilots were classified as performing either at standard or below standard after about 3 years of employment in the hiring company. In a multiple-regression model, this dichotomous criterion for job success can be predicted with 73.8% accuracy through the simulator checkflight and flying experience prior to employment. By adding the personality questionnaire to the regression equation, the number of correct classifications increases to 79.3%.

Vection is commonly produced by an optokinetic drum (OKD). The purpose of this investigation was to build a low-cost OKD capable of producing motion sickness and sopite syndrome. METHODS: The OKD consists of a steel wire-frame cylinder (4' height, 4.75' diameter) covered by white ""blackout"" fabric. The inner walls are lined with randomly placed 3"" black fabric circles. The interior is illuminated, and lighting is controlled by a dimmer switch. The cylinder is suspended and driven by a rheostat-controlled ceiling fan motor. Rotation speed varies from 12 to 25.5 RPM. An adjustable pneumatic chair is positioned inside the OKD to standardize participant seated height. Three undergraduate psychology students at Old Dominion University were used to test the effectiveness of the design. Participants were exposed to vection at 12 RPM for up to 10 minutes. Subjective responses were assessed using the Mild Motion Questionnaire (MMQ) and the Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ) at three intervals: pre-exposure, immediate post-exposure, and 15-min post-exposure. RESULTS: All participants perceived vection after 2-3 minutes, once terminal velocity was achieved. One participant ceased participation after 9 minutes of exposure. On average, MSQ and MMQ scores increased 14 points and 7.5, respectively, from pre-exposure to immediate post-exposure. From immediate post-exposure to 15-min post-exposure, average MSQ and MMQ scores dropped 8 and 19 points, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our low-cost, low-technology OKD was effective for inducing vection and produced self-reported symptoms of motion sickness within a short duration. However, greater variability was observed for the production of sopite syndrome, possibly due to the strength of the stimulus. A potential method for producing sopite syndrome might be to expose participants to vection for intermittent intervals over a longer duration of time.","INTRODUCTION: Experimental investigations of motion sickness require devices to present gravitoinertial acceleration, induce vection, or produce visual rearrangement.

983,2004,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",The Joint Effects of Person and Situation Factors on Stress in Spaceflight,"Psychologists can play an important role in spaceflight and exploration. Indeed, their input at four specific stages in spaceflight can help to ensure successful missions. Psychologists have a role to play in: 1) Selection; 2) Training; 3) Real or Simulated Space Missions; and 4) Post-Flight Problems. During selection, psychologists can provide guidelines as to the appropriate coping styles for reacting to mission-related stressors. During training, psychologists can help astronauts to plan for, and cope with, problems (e.g., group conflict). Training in social sensitivity, or in specific coping styles (i.e., to be high in task-oriented coping), would be beneficial so that astronauts are able to deal with unforeseen problems. Task-oriented coping is related to control and efficiency, and reduces stress and anxiety. Emotion-oriented coping relates to anxiety for controllable situations, and task-oriented coping is most efficacious. A primary role for psychologists would be the investigation of what problems could arise from living with others in a limited space and for long periods of times. As such, investigations into group dynamics, physical and psychological stress caused by such an environment, and the lack of normal ways to deal with these problems should all be considered. It is also clear that the impact of spaceflight on an individual does not end with physical re-entry. On the contrary, the astronaut will also have to make a psychological post-flight ""re-entry"" readjustment to life on Earth. Psychologists have an important role to play during all four stages of the space program, especially in regards to person by situation interactions. That is, space is a novel environment for human beings, and we need to investigate how we can better improve the fit between astronauts and space situational stressors. Not only are person by situation interactions relevant for each of the four stages discussed above, but each of the stages interacts with one another bidirectionally and even multidirectionally.","Psychologists can play an important role in spaceflight and exploration.

985,2016,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,Sleep and Fatigue Differences in the Two Most Common Types of Commercial Flight Operations,"BACKGROUND: Sleep and fatigue management is one of the main challenges in airline operations scheduling. Our aim was to compare the differences regarding fatigue, sleep, and labor specificities between the two most common types of flight, short/medium haul (SM-H) and long haul (L-H), in a large sample of airline pilots. METHODS: A self-report questionnaire was developed, composed of socio-economic and labor questions, and psychological assessment scales for fatigue and sleep. Associations of these variables and type of flight were tested. RESULTS: Of the total sample of Portuguese airline pilots (N = 435), 313 (72%) were from SM-H and 122 (28%) were from L-H. For SM-H, the values obtained for sleep complaints were 34.2%, daytime sleepiness 61.6%, and fatigue 93.0%. For L-H, 36.9%, 53.3%, and 84.4%, respectively. Looking at labor variables, the differences between the two types of flights were evident, with SM-H pilots' having statistically significant higher mean values of duty and flight hours, numbers of sectors, and early mornings. Only the mean number of night periods was higher in L-H pilots. All values were reported for 28 consecutive scheduling days. CONCLUSION: Night periods and time-zone crossing may explain higher prevalence levels of sleep disturbances in L-H pilots. However, the values for daytime sleepiness were higher in SM-H pilots, which may be attributed to diminished sleep caused by a combination of frequent early starts and long duty periods. Taking into account the large differences between the two types of flights, different regulatory limits should be considered by aviation authorities. Reis C, Mestre C, Canhao H, Gradwell D, Paiva T.

986,2014,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Risk of Incident Mental Health Conditions Among Critical Care Air Transport Team Members,"This study investigated whether Critical Care AirTransport Team (CCATT) members are at increased risk for incident post-deployment mental health conditions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective co-hort study of 604 U.S. Air Force medical personnel without preexisting mental health conditions who had at least one deployment as a CCATT member during 2003-2012 as compared to a control group of 604 medical personnel, frequency matched based on job role, with at least one deployment during the same period, but without CCATT experience. Electronic health record data were used to ascertain the diagnosis of a mental health condition. Results: The incidence of post-deployment mental health conditions was 2.1 per 1000 mo for the CCATT group versus 2.2 per 1000 mo for the control group. The six most frequent diagnoses were the same in both groups: adjustment reaction not including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, major depressive disorder, specific disorders of sleep of nonorganic origin, PTSD, and depressive disorder not elsewhere classified. Women were at marginally increased risk and nurses and technicians were at twice the risk of physicians. The distribution of the time interval from end of the most recent deployment to diagnosis of incident mental health condition was positively skewed with a median greater than 6 mo. Conclusions: CCATT members were at no increased risk for incident post-deployment mental health conditions as compared to non-CCATT medical service members. Nearly two- thirds of incident post-deployment mental health conditions were diagnosed outside the standard 6-mo medical surveillance period, a finding warranting further study.","This study investigated whether Critical Care AirTransport Team (CCATT) members are at increased risk for incident post-deployment mental health conditions.

987,2012,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",DEVELOPING A LATENT TRAIT MODEL TO PREDICT SOPITE SYNDROME IN AEROSPACE SYSTEMS,"INTRODUCTION: Commonly cited sources of performance decrements in aerospace systems are fatigue, workload, and stress. An often overlooked contributor to performance decrements is sopite syndrome, a response to motion characterized by intense drowsiness, lethargy, and decreased concentration. Other than previous incidences, it is presently unknown what other factors predict sopite susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between potential predictors of self-reported sopite syndrome in order to improve assessment methods. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-six undergraduate psychology students at Old Dominion University participated in an online study that included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Mild Motion Questionnaire (MMQ), and Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ). Questionnaires were completed anonymously and administered simultaneously with medical history and demographic questionnaires. RESULTS: Multiple regression was used to predict MMQ composite scores based on ESS composite scores, MSQ composite scores, and participant sex. All variables were entered simultaneously because there was no theoretical basis for considering any trait prior to another. The model produced an R(2) of.51, F(3, 342)= 118.82, p<.001. However, the only significant predictor was MSQ composite scores, t = 18.22, p <.001. ESS composite scores (t = 1.29, p =.198) and gender (r =1.20, p =.231) were not statistically significant predictors. DISCUSSION: Based on this study, motion sickness trait scores are the best predictor of sopite-like symptoms, as indicated by MMQ composite scores. Trait sleepiness and sex did not account for a significant amount of variability among sopite-like symptoms. While other traits need to be measured and considered, this is the first study to consider a predictive model for sopite syndrome. A predictive model of sopite syndrome could be utilized to better screen individuals for susceptibility and eventually provide information for developing sopite syndrome countermeasures.","INTRODUCTION: Commonly cited sources of performance decrements in aerospace systems are fatigue, workload, and stress.

989,2013,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",Ejection in Hostile Environments: Medico-Psychological Aspects for the Fighter Pilot,"Introduction: In the French Air Force, commitment of fighter squadrons in Afghanistan revives the fear among pilots of being ejected in a hostile environment, along with the prospect of being captured. Clinical Observations: Although ejection in a hostile environment is an exceptional event, it is what flight crews fear most strongly over enemy territory. Since the widespread use of ejection seats in fighter aircraft in the 1950s, ejection has become a means of protecting the crews' lives. Ejection is a breaking point when the pilot suddenly passes from an intense activity to a passive position in which he (or she) is often helpless and sometimes exposed to the hostility of the environment where he lands. It is always important to analyze the circumstances surrounding an ejection. Some clinical observations allow us to understand the psycho-traumatic potential of this brutal experience. In a hostile environment, ejection quite rapidly becomes a question of survival. Discussion: The pilot is technically and physically prepared during training. He (or she) regularly trains for the use of the ejection seat and the equipment to protect himself, to report, and ensure his survival until his recovery. Because it is always a singular event, on a case-by-case basis, no psychological reaction to such a situation can be modeled with a view to predicting psycho-traumatic disorders. Conclusion: Since 2007, there has been a medico-psychological supporting device, organized by the French Air Force, to be used after this type of event.","Introduction: In the French Air Force, commitment of fighter squadrons in Afghanistan revives the fear among pilots of being ejected in a hostile environment, along with the prospect of being captured.

The key element of psychological monitoring and support during long duration missions required for all crew members are ""private psychological conferences"" (PPCs). METHODS: In a PPC a crew member and a psychological support person on ground have a ""private"" (i.e. protected) real-time conversation which can be audio or video-based. It is scheduled for a period of at least 10 minutes on a bi-weekly basis. The purpose of PPCs is first to monitor the behavior and performance state of the crew member and second to provide coaching if needed. A first survey of the experiences with PPCs during the first 7 years of ISS operation (Expedition 1-13) has been provided by Manzey et al. (2007). However that data set included only one European astronaut. RESULTS: The current data at hand comprise a set of five ESA crew members who participated in long duration missions. Descriptive analyses and subjective accounts from experts who have conducted PPCs are reported. The average duration of PPCs was considerably longer than the minimum allotted time of 10 minutes. There are inter- and intra-individual differences concerning PPC duration. DISCUSSION: In general, the data indicate astronauts' acceptance of PPCs as a monitoring tool. As a support tool, however, astronauts differ in utilizing and appraising PPCs. Experiences show that audio and video conferences are clearly preferable to involving only the auditory channel. All together data reflect approval by the astronauts. For future missions beyond Earth orbit, a real-time two-way communication may not be applicable. This will require new challenges for psychological support from ground.","INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of Human Behavior and Performance (HBP) support is to assist the astronaut during long-duration ISS missions in maintaining a high level of well-being and performance efficiency throughout the mission, as well as to facilitate effective co-living and co-working within the space crew as a whole.

992,2015,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,A RECONSIDERATION OF FATIGUE-RELATED DATA FROM EARLIER RESEARCH,"INTRODUCTION: Periodically it is invaluable to re-investigate the data from earlier studies, with a view to applying more contemporary perspectives. This presentation will deal with the fatigue-related findings from a study into crew performance of aircrew working very long duty periods. METHODS: Multiple physiological and psychological performance data metrics were utilized on crew patterns comprising a pattern of three flying-duty days, with suitable rest periods between. Data was additionally collected for three days either side of the pattern. The data collection tools included actigraphy, PVT, Samn-Perelli scale, work-rest diary, and a neurocognitive test battery. RESULTS: Nine aircrew participated, with most subjects involved in multiple data collection patterns. Although the data set was small, it accurately represented the population of aircrew on that aircraft type at that time. Data was analyzed after making allowance for multiple data points from single participants, circadian-time, and local-time effects. DISCUSSION: Data analysis revealed that participants over-reported sleep by approximately 15%. This is noteworthy when considering whether an aviator obtained sufficient sleep during the scheduled rest period. It was revealed that the fatigue state of aircrew immediately prior to deployment was higher than had previously been expected. This is an important issue for military and potentially civilian operations, when considering where to apportion resources to reduce fatigue-related risk. However, not all of the data had negative connotations; with an improvement in PVT performance noted at the end of very long crew duty periods. This performance rallying effect should not be relied upon as a mitigator for the fatigue resulting from long crew duty periods. Further research into these areas may be warranted.","INTRODUCTION: Periodically it is invaluable to re-investigate the data from earlier studies, with a view to applying more contemporary perspectives.

994,2019,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,AGSM Proficiency and Depression Are Associated With Success of High-G Training in Trainee Pilots,"INTRODUCTION: High-gravity (G) training is used to educate trainee pilots about anti-G straining maneuvers (AGSM) in an environment similar to that of a real fighter aircraft, and to enhance their G tolerance. The success or failure of high-G training could be multifactorial, but most previous studies have only focused on the effect of pilots’ physical condition.METHODS: A total of 138 male trainee pilots participated in this study. All trainee pilots had received AGSM training from experienced instructors and then underwent centrifuge high-G training. Participants completed questionnaire surveys about body size, lifestyle, self-reported AGSM proficiency, resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC), and depression level (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D).RESULTS: Of the 138 subjects, 100 (72.5%) successfully completed high-G training without experiencing G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) within two trials; these were allocated to the success group. The remaining 38 (27.5%) subjects who completed the training after three or more attempts, or who failed to complete the training at all, were allocated to the failure group. Multivariate analyses revealed that the success of centrifuge training was positively associated with age and self-reported AGSM proficiency, and negatively associated with depression level.DISCUSSION: The success of high-G training was significantly associated with self-reported AGSM proficiency and depression level. Instructors should emphasize the importance of AGSM proficiency and offer practice-based learning to trainee pilots. In addition, they should pay attention to not only trainee pilots’ physical condition, but also their psychological status.Yun C, Oh S, Shin YH.

We exposed six healthy adults to 100 ppm toluene or air (control) for 6 h, in a double-blind, randomized fashion, with exposures separated by at least 14 d and including 30 min of exercise at a level that quadrupled minute ventilation. Blood and exhaled air toluene levels were measured before, during, immediately, and 1 and 2 h post-exposure. Lung function was measured before and immediately after exposure. Following exercise, the mean blood and exhaled air toluene levels averaged 1.5 mu g and 28 ppm, respectively. Lung function was unchanged post-exposure. On the SYNWORK test, the Composite score obtained over time during toluene exposure was lower than that during room air (F = 29.20, p = 0.005), with the score from the final hour reduced by 10%. On standard neuropsychological tests, latency but not accuracy proved the sensitive measure for five of the seven subtests presented.","The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of inhalation of toluene on respiratory function and neuropsychological performance of humans.

996,1992,,"PROPOSED FEDERAL TRANSFER CENTER, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA.","PURPOSE: Construction and operation of a new Federal Transfer Center (FTC) is proposed at the Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The FTC would be a 1,000-unit, short-term facility designed to house sentenced inmates who are being transported through the U.S. Marshals Service's National Prisoner Transportation System (NPTS). The transported inmates would include those who were recently sentenced and in transit to a designated federal correctional facility or those who are being transferred between federal correctional facilities. Rogers Airport serves as the primary hub of the Marshals Service flight network for the NPTS. Inmates from incoming flights are required to wait for two to three weeks for outgoing transportation to the appropriate facilities. The new FTC would be staffed by 225 to 250 full-time employees who would provide 24-hour supervision. The FTC would replace the inmate holdover operation at the El Reno, Oklahoma Federal Correctional Institution (FCI). The new FTC would be located at the southeast corner of MacArthur Avenue and Southwest 74th Street, directly south of the Federal Aviation Administration's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center. The FTC, which would be constructed by the Oklahoma City Department of Airports and leased and operated by the Bureau of Prisons, would consist of one midrise structure designed to contain approximately 1,000 detention units within approximately 500,000 square feet. The structure would be connected by secure jetways to transport aircraft. The primary structure would be designed to be self-contained and include housing units, a health unit, kitchen, laundry, areas for inmate services, library, and recreational facilities. Parking for approximately 180 vehicles would be provided. The project would also include the necessary aircraft aprons and runway connections. Perimeter security provisions would be incorporated within the structure itself and would not be obvious from the exterior. Operational services would include psychology services, chaplain services, recreation and other leisure time activities, educational services, staff training, medical services, administrative systems management, case management coordination, general facilities operations, correctional services, and visitation services. POSITIVE IMPACTS: In combination with other actions, the operations of the FTC would contribute substantially to the implementation of national criminal justice initiatives. The El Reno FCI, which is overcrowded, would be relieved, and the distance that inmates would have to travel from where they are held to the airport, which is currently approximately 30 miles, would be lessened significantly. Construction and operating expenditures and employment would generally benefit the local economy. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Facility construction and operation would result in less than significant impacts to the immediate project site and local community; slight impacts would affect utility services, traffic and transportation movements to and from the site, and ambient noise levels and air quality.","PURPOSE: Construction and operation of a new Federal Transfer Center (FTC) is proposed at the Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

997,2015,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,"PRIMARY CARE IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS: MEDICAL CLINIC UTILIZATION AT ANTARCTIC STATIONS, 2013-2014","INTRODUCTION: The unique challenges posed by the Antarctic environment include both the physiological and psychological stressors to the individual as well as the limited on-site medical capabilities available to address them. Decreased physical activity, exposure to prolonged day/night periods, relative isolation, and severe changes in altitude all contribute to medical incidents at the U.S. Antarctic stations. This report compares medical clinic utilization between three U.S. Antarctic stations to identify differences in diagnostic frequency and utilization of clinic resources. METHODS: Clinic data from three Antarctic locations (McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and Palmer Station) for the 2013-2014 Antarctic year were reviewed for patient encounters, diagnostic frequency, and similar parameters. Differences between visit and diagnostic frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: The McMurdo clinic encountered 1555 patient encounters, with South Pole Station reporting 744 and Palmer with 128 patients over the year. Most frequent reasons for clinic visits were orthopedic and dermatologic, with increased visits at the more remote locations for neurologic complaints and insomnia. Altitude sickness was reported only at McMurdo and South Pole stations. DISCUSSION: The clinic volume predictably correlated with station population. Frequent complaints of mild disequilibrium and malaise attributed to sea-sickness were seen at Palmer station. Insomnia and headache complaints, reported only at the Pole, are likely associated with the increased elevation at that site, though could be attributable to psychological stress from the isolated environment. Further advances in screening, improved recognition of pre-emergent conditions, and improved emergency management resources could have significant improvements in healthcare delivery on the ice.","INTRODUCTION: The unique challenges posed by the Antarctic environment include both the physiological and psychological stressors to the individual as well as the limited on-site medical capabilities available to address them.

998,2001,"Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine","Personality Factors, Stoicism and Motivation in Subjects under Hypoxic Stress in Extreme Environments","Previous studies on the physiological and psychological adaptation of subjects to survival conditions involving high-altitude hypoxia (>6500 m) have shown that personality factors are important in this adaptation. We, therefore, proposed personality traits assessments in two groups of subjects engaged in sporting activities under extreme hypoxic environmental conditions: a group of mountaineers at high altitudes (>5500 m) and a group of free-lung divers at great depths (<30-60 m). These subjects were compared with two control groups: a group of subjects practicing no sport and another one practicing various competitive athletic activities involving speed constraints. The personality traits assessed concerned mainly the subjects' attitudes and their propensities to act out their feelings and fantasies; they were assessed using projective procedures, the Hand Test and Clark's Situational Pain Questionnaire based on the Sensory Decision Theory. Subjects trained in mountaineering and free-lung diving under extreme environmental conditions displayed a high degree of stoicism. These individuals shared some personality traits with other sportsmen, particularly aggressive tendencies and introversion although not to an extent which interfered with normal interpersonal relationships. However, at least when practicing these extreme sports, the subjects did retreat from society. One of our questions concerns the grounds for this social withdrawal, that is, whether it derives from a inner compulsion founded on personality factors or if it is merely an artifact of our perceptions of the subjects, created by the confluence of the individualistic nature of these sports and the extreme environments in which they are performed.","Previous studies on the physiological and psychological adaptation of subjects to survival conditions involving high-altitude hypoxia (>6500 m) have shown that personality factors are important in this adaptation.

In both cases, a very important question for designers of such displays is which elements of pictorial detail in the presented image are needed for satisfactory task or mission performance. Two elements of pictorial detail, a visible runway outline and ground texture, are considered in this article. An experiment is described in which the participants were required to initiate the landing maneuver during a simplified aircraft-landing task. This experiment was developed with 2 goals in mind: The first objective was to determine whether performance was influenced by the addition of ground texture; a second objective was to find out whether participants based their timing of the initiation of the landing maneuver on altitude perception or on the so-called time-to-contact. In the landing case, TTC is defined as the time remaining to the moment that the wheels make contact with the runway if no pilot action is taken. The results of the experiment show that landing performance is improved when ground texture is added to the display. The results also suggest that participants change their timing behavior from a strategy based on altitude perception when only a runway outline is present, to one based on TTC perception when texture is added to the display.","Artificial outside-world displays currently used in flight simulators may, in the future, also be applied to aircraft cockpits to enhance vision or to provide a completely synthetic replacement.

1006,1979,Otolaryngologic clinics of North America,Sociopsychological factors affecting the human response to noise exposure,"Community noise is reported to be the most often mentioned undesirable neighborhood condition in a recent U.S. Census survey. Understanding community response to noise involves the measurement of a number of complex acoustic and nonacoustic variables and establishing the chain of relationships between physical exposure, perception, annoyance, and acceptability responses and finally complaint behavior. The perceived loudness of a noise is the most important acoustic parameter influencing annoyance and complaints, and the simple dBA unit can be used to integrate spectral characteristics of complex sounds in community studies. Although energy averaging such as Leq or Ldn can be used to describe multiple noise exposures over time, the variable trade-off relationships between number and level of exposures are somewhat obscured by such summary measures. However, they are still the best available descriptors and, until more accurate ones are developed, can be used to measure community noise environments. Perception of an identical noise exposure can vary according to the physiological noise sensitivity of a person and the activity context in which the noise is heard. Although the acoustic quality of the noise itself usually explains about 10 to 25 per cent of the variability in annoyance responses, sociopsychological variables measured in field studies account for 35 to 50 per cent of the variations in human annoyance responses. Three of the most important nonacoustic factors are the connotative fear effects of the noise signal, the feeling that those responsible for the noise are misfeasant in not reducing the noise, and the feeling that harmful health effects are produced by the noise. When residents report great fear, a high misfeasance, and marked health effects, about 90 per cent report a high annoyance level whether their noise exposure level is above 90 Ldn or 65 to 70 Ldn. In contrast, if the feelings are a low fear level, a low degree of misfeasance, and minimal health effects, only 3 to 10 per cent give high annoyance responses. Complaint behavior, although based on intensity of annoyance, is modified by a number of other sociopsychological factors and often is an unreliable indicator of an environmental problem.Community noise is reported to be the most often mentioned undesirable neighborhood condition in a recent U.S. Census survey.

1007,1985,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,CHRISTOPHER CAUDWELL: ONE MAN IN HIS TIME,"Christopher Caudwell (pseudonym of Christopher St. John Sprigg), who died fighting with the International Brigades in Spain on February 12th, 1937, left a remarkable volume of manuscript behind him. A central concern of this study is to show how his multifarious interests--science, poetry, aviation, detective fiction, politics--become more readily explicable in the context of the epoch. The first chapter, ""In the Thirties,"" (its title from Edward Upward's typological fiction) sets out to describe the ""narrative"" of the thirties, the recurrent motifs (in both imaginative literature and personal testimony) of despair within the ""dying culture."" The second chapter attempts to situate Caudwell's life and work within this discernable structure and argues that his ""conversion"" was (unlike his better known contemporaries) a fully conscious one. Chapter Three, ""The Poet and Novelist"" devotes itself to the preoccupations of Christopher St. John Sprigg and suggests that although he thought little of his detective books, his regard for himself as a poet was quite another matter. Since Sprigg wrote the kind of poetry that Caudwell condemned in the work of others, the task of reconciling his Marxism with his poetry, had he survived Spain, would have been a long and difficult struggle. The belief that poetry can effect change--a central concern in the consciousness of the epoch--is one of the fundamental bases of Illusion and Reality. Chapter Four is devoted to this work, tracing the book's origins and its evolution. It situates Caudwell's synthesis of Marx and Freud within the context of other such attempts, and considers his contribution to the Marxian search for an objective psychology based on the social nature of the sign. The final chapter concerns itself almost exclusively with a contextual appraisal of Studies and Further Studies in a Dying Culture, all of which were written after Caudwell had committed himself to the necessity of Party work, and which find their matrix in the conviction (voiced in Romance and Realism): that the committed writer must help formulate a new Weltanschauung by ""destructively analysing all bourgeois culture.""","Christopher Caudwell (pseudonym of Christopher St. John Sprigg), who died fighting with the International Brigades in Spain on February 12th, 1937, left a remarkable volume of manuscript behind him.

1011,2009,Psychological Science,Social Learning Mechanisms and Cumulative Cultural Evolution: Is Imitation Necessary?,"Cumulative cultural evolution has been suggested to account for key cognitive and behavioral attributes that distinguish modern humans from their anatomically similar ancestors, but researchers have yet to establish which cognitive mechanisms are responsible for this kind of learning and whether they are unique to humans. Here, we show that human participants' cumulative learning is not always reliant on sources of social information commonly assumed to be essential. Seven hundred participants were organized into 70 microsocieties and completed a task involving building a paper airplane. We manipulated the availability of opportunities for imitation (reproducing actions), emulation (reproducing end results), and teaching. Each condition was independently sufficient for participants to show cumulative learning. Because emulative learning can elicit cumulative culture on this task, we conclude that accounts of the unusual complexity of human culture in terms of species-unique learning mechanisms do not currently provide complete explanations and that other factors may be involved.

1013,2004,Monash University Accident Research Centre Reports,Review of recent research in applied experimental psychology: Implications for countermeasure development in road safety,"Much research that occurs within the field of traffic psychology leads to the development of effective road safety countermeasures. There may, however, be psychological research being undertaken in other domains, such as aviation or mining, that has the potential to both provide new directions for, and enhance the effectiveness of, current road safety countermeasures. The purpose of this report, therefore, was to review recent literature in the broad field of applied experimental psychology and distil from it, where appropriate, recommendations for countermeasure development. This work was completed in three stages. The first task involved a review of research from selected journals in the period 1998-2002. The research was sorted into logical headings. The general headings that emerged were: information processing and cognition; decision making; mental workload; and human error. The review included research relating to specific fitness for duty issues, such as the effects on driving performance of fatigue, alcohol and drugs. The major advances in the understanding of these latter issues are occurring within the road safety domain, and hence are included here. Summaries of the recent developments in each of these areas are presented in the Executive Summary. The immediate outcome of this review was the identification of theories, frameworks, models, and countermeasures that are used in domains other than road safety that may provide some insight into the development of new ideas to be used for road safety countermeasure development, including behavioural, engineering, and enforcement-based approaches. The second task involved consideration of the relevance of the research reviewed for refinement and development of road safety countermeasures. To achieve this, the literature review was distributed internally to a number of MUARC researchers, most of whom are highly experienced with a broad appreciation of road safety issues. They were invited to suggest possible countermeasures deriving from the material reviewed, and to document these under one or more of the following headings: education; training; promotion/advertising; traffic engineering; legislation; enforcement; licensing; vehicle design; and ""other"" countermeasures. Recommendations for further research were included within one or more of these categories. With the exception of the latter category, most countermeasures for injury prevention in the road safety domain fell under one or more of these headings. The third and final task involved collating the outputs from the above into a final set of recommendations for countermeasure development. Two important outcomes of this review were noted: confirmation that there are developments in behavioural research, not widely known in the road safety domain, which have the potential to lead to the development of new countermeasures; and the realisation that some of the information gleaned can be used to refine existing countermeasures. Briefly, some of the key findings relate to: developments in training techniques and methodologies that have potential to enhance the effectiveness of the driver training regime in Victoria; opportunities for the use of advanced simulation to support improved design and evaluation of vehicle cockpit interfaces and of traffic management systems; tools and techniques that are being developed to support and optimise the design of the human-vehicle interaction, in ways that reduce driver reduce workload and distraction; and the absence of predictive models of human behaviour and error causation in the road safety domain. Recommendations for countermeasure refinement and development are outlined in detail in the final chapter of this report.","Much research that occurs within the field of traffic psychology leads to the development of effective road safety countermeasures.

For the first time, perhaps since the Vietnam War, the entire United States of America was engulfed in a mutual sense of loss and inconsolable grief. 2996 people, a vast number of them unarmed civilians including all the passengers aboard the four hijacked airplanes, lost their lives in what was perceived by many to be the worst terrorist attack of the twenty-first century. Occurrence of such a colossal tragedy has led to producing a large corpus of textual representation of the event including countless novels such as Amy Waldman's The Submission (2012). This study focuses on analysing The Submission by Amy Waldman using the theory of Psychoanalysis to explore the concept of psychological trauma and the effects of PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) on female characters affected by the tragedy of 9/11. The analysis, which is mostly based on Wilson and Keane (2004) and Caruth (2001) psychoanalysis theories, seeks to explore Waldman's perception of the process of healing from the devastating tragedy and psychological trauma of the female characters of the story. It is believed that Waldman's novel does not only portray the trauma of the characters but also presents the path of recovery and overcoming the PTSD of those who were emotionally wounded by the tragedy of 9/11.","On September 11, 2001, the world was stunned into silence as four hijacked airplanes crashed into two of America's iconic landmarks, namely the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon.

1017,2006,Behavior research methods,Investigating systematic individual differences in sleep-deprived performance on a high-fidelity flight simulator,"Laboratory research has revealed considerable systematic variability in the degree to which individuals' alertness and performance are affected by sleep deprivation. However, little is known about whether or not different populations exhibit similar levels of individual variability. In the present study, we examined individual variability in performance impairment due to sleep loss in a highly select population of militaryjet pilots. Ten active-duty F-117 pilots were deprived of sleep for 38 h and studied repeatedly in a high-fidelity flight simulator. Data were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA to quantify individual variability. Statistically significant, systematic individual differences in the effects of sleep deprivation were observed, even when baseline differences were accounted for. The findings suggest that highly select populations may exhibit individual differences in vulnerability to performance impairment from sleep loss just as the general population does. Thus, the scientific and operational communities' reliance on group data as opposed to individual data may entail substantial misestimation of the impact of job-related stressors on safety and performance.Laboratory research has revealed considerable systematic variability in the degree to which individuals' alertness and performance are affected by sleep deprivation.

1020,1990,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences","The 'problem' with automation: inappropriate feedback and interaction, not 'over-automation'","As automation increasingly takes its place in industry, especially high risk industry, it is often blamed for causing harm and increasing the chance of human error when failures do occur. I propose that the problem is not the presence of automation, but rather its inappropriate design. The problem is that the operations under normal operating conditions are performed appropriately, but there is inadequate feedback and interaction with the humans who must control the overall conduct of the task. When the situations exceed the capabilities of the automatic equipment, then the inadequate feedback leads to difficulties for the human controllers. The problem, I suggest, is that the automation is at an intermediate level of intelligence, powerful enough to take over control that used to be done by people, but not powerful enough to handle all abnormalities. Moreover, its level of intelligence is insufficient to provide the continual, appropriate feedback that occurs naturally among human operators. This is the source of the current difficulties. To solve this problem, the automation should either be made less intelligent or more so, but the current level is quite inappropriate. The overall message is that it is possible to reduce error through appropriate design considerations. Appropriate design should assume the existence of error, it should continually provide feedback, it should continually interact with operators in an effective manner, and it should allow for the worst situations possible. What is needed is a soft, compliant technology, not a rigid, formal one.As automation increasingly takes its place in industry, especially high risk industry, it is often blamed for causing harm and increasing the chance of human error when failures do occur.

1023,2017,Journal of Military Ethics,"Remotely Piloted Aircraft, Risk, and Killing as Sacrifice: The Cost of Remote Warfare","In this paper I argue that a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilot's act of killing remotely, when it is done in the defense of another person, can be viewed as an act of sacrifice. This argument concludes from two premises. First, the RPA pilot faces psychological risk to self by carrying out such an action; second, the RPA pilot is motivated to some significant degree by something other than self-interest. Moreover, I challenge both the view that RPA represent merely an incremental development in technology yielding an incremental expansion of the distance between the war-fighter and the target and the view that RPA is revolutionary in some fundamental sense. I instead argue that, based upon the natural geometric boundary imposed by the earth's shape, RPA have maximized the physical distance between the war-fighter and the target and, over time, this fact will change, not only the psychological effects on the RPA pilot, but also the way we view killing and distance in general. When taken together, these two broad claims, that other-defense can justify killing in war and that there is a psychological cost paid by remote killers, yield a conception of remote killing as an act of sacrifice that will inform the broader conversation about ethics, risk, killing, and RPA.","In this paper I argue that a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilot's act of killing remotely, when it is done in the defense of another person, can be viewed as an act of sacrifice.

1025,2020,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,Air travel attitude functions,"Forecast growth in global demand for air travel is incompatible with emissions reduction targets. Scholarly attention is urgently needed to address attitude and behaviour change that supports sector-wide emissions reduction. Informed by the longstanding field of consumer psychology, the innovative approach adopted in this paper is to critically address air travel behaviour change through the application of attitude function theory. An analysis of the literature reveals that current attitudes reflect industry myths, and are further hampered by travellers' knowledge gaps regarding the relationship between aviation and climate change. Five attitude functions are analysed in the context of attitudes to air travel; knowledge, utilitarian, value-expressive, ego-defensive and social adjustive functions. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates attitude structure, attitude function and the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion as an innovative approach to address discretionary air travel and behaviour change at the level of the individual consumer. Utilizing this framework, future research can help develop a critical understanding of the antecedents that shape attitudes. Researchers will be better positioned to create persuasive messages aimed at changing attitudes towards air travel, as arguably the key step towards the illusive goal of significant behaviour change and a shift towards more sustainable tourist mobilities.","Forecast growth in global demand for air travel is incompatible with emissions reduction targets.

1032,2001,Human factors,Context-dependent memory under stressful conditions: the case of skydiving,"Two experiments examined the effect of differing levels of emotional arousal on learning and memory for words in matching and mismatching contexts. In Experiment 1, experienced skydivers learned words either in the air or on the ground and recalled them in the same context or in the other context. Experiment 2 replicated the stimuli and design of the first experiment except that participants were shown a skydiving video in lieu of skydiving. Recall was poor in air-learning conditions with actual skydiving, but when lists were learned on land, recall was higher in the matching context than in the mismatching context. In the skydiving video experiment, recall was higher in matching learn-recall contexts regardless of the situation in which learning occurred. We propose that under extremely emotionally arousing circumstances, environmental and/or mood cues are unlikely to become encoded or linked to newly acquired information and thus cannot serve as cues to retrieval. Results can be applied to understanding variations in context-dependent memory in occupations (e.g., police, military special operations, and Special Weapons and Tactics teams) in which the worker experiences considerable emotional stress while learning or recalling new information.Two experiments examined the effect of differing levels of emotional arousal on learning and memory for words in matching and mismatching contexts.

1036,2022,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,A Systematic Scoping Review and Textual Narrative Synthesis of Physical and Mixed-Reality Simulation in Pre-Service Teacher Training,"Background: Due to recent lockdown conditions, which restricted opportunities for face-to-face contact and the ability to be physically in schools, the need for novel, safe ways to train pre-service teachers emerged even more pressingly. Whilst virtual simulation has received some attention in pedagogy and its benefits have been demonstrated in many disciplines, there appears to be less synthesized evidence on the use of physical and/or mixed-reality simulation utilized in teacher training. Objectives: The goal of this systematic scoping review was to summarize and synthesize the literature on the use of physical and/or mixed-reality simulation in pre-service teacher training. Methods: A systematic scoping literature review combined with a textual narrative synthesis was undertaken. Ten reference databases were searched in May 2020: Academic search premier, CINAHL, Education Research Complete, Humanities International Complete, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, PsycInfo, Teacher Reference Center, Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus. Results and Conclusions: Following inclusion/exclusion criteria assessment and screening, 13 articles were included for appraisal and synthesis. Seven papers examined physical simulations, while the remainder examined mixed-reality simulations. The evidence from this review suggests that simulation, including physical and mixed-reality types, could be used as a tool to increase confidence, self-efficacy, classroom management skills and communication. Implications: In comparison to other fields (e.g., nursing, medicine and aviation) simulation in education appears to be in its infancy--more large-scale research is needed. At the same time, this review indicates that mixed-reality simulation in particular has the potential for contributing to teacher education, because it offers the potential for learning in various contexts when compared to traditional didactic teaching practices.","Background: Due to recent lockdown conditions, which restricted opportunities for face-to-face contact and the ability to be physically in schools, the need for novel, safe ways to train pre-service teachers emerged even more pressingly.

1044,1999,Safety Science,Organisational failure: lessons from industry applied in the medical domain,"Risk management in the medical domain and medical accidents in particular are receiving growing interest from researchers in industrial engineering and management sciences, psychology, and human factors. Historically there has been little systematic attempt to explore and assess safety for both staff and patients in the medical domain. Conversely, many methods exist to analyse safety and risks in industrial settings, particularly in high-risk industries such as chemical processing, the nuclear power industry, and aviation. To cope with the increasing demand for risk management methods and tools in the medical domain, the possibility of transferring methods and tools initially developed for industrial settings to the medical domain is investigated. This article questions both the benefits and risks of transferring tools from industry to the medical domain. For this purpose, a taxonomy for classifying organisational root causes of safety-related incidents, developed in the steel industry, will be presented. This taxonomy will then be used to classify organisational root causes of both industrial and medical incidents. The article concludes by evaluating the applicability of the taxonomy in the two different domains.","Risk management in the medical domain and medical accidents in particular are receiving growing interest from researchers in industrial engineering and management sciences, psychology, and human factors.

1055,2012,Journal of Experimental Psychology,Effective rotations: Action effects determine the interplay of mental and manual rotations,"The last decades have seen a growing interest in the impact of action on perception and other concurrent cognitive processes. One particularly interesting example is that manual rotation actions facilitate mental rotations in the same direction. The present study extends this research in two fundamental ways. First, Experiment 1 demonstrates that not only manual rotations facilitate mental rotations but that mental rotations also facilitate subsequent manual rotations. Second, Experiments 2 and 3 targeted the mechanisms underlying this interplay. Here, manual steering wheel rotations produced salient visual effects, namely the rotation of either a plane or a horizon in an aviation display. The rotation direction of these visual effects either did or did not correspond to the direction of the manual rotation itself. These experiments clearly demonstrate an impact of sensory action effects: Mental rotations facilitate manual rotations with visual effects of the same direction (as the mental rotation), irrespective of the direction of the manual rotation. These findings highlight the importance of effect anticipation in action planning. As such they support the contentions of ideomotor theory and shed new light on the cognitive source of the interplay between visual imagery and motor control.

1057,2008,Journal of Safety Research,Risk tolerance and pilot involvement in hazardous events and flight into adverse weather,"Introduction According to Lopes [Lopes, L.L. (1987). Between hope and fear: The psychology of risk. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 20, 255-295] tolerance of risk may be governed by sensitivity to either the opportunities for gain or threats of loss involved. Methods: In the initial study, qualified pilots were presented with 36 written flight scenarios that varied in the levels of opportunity and threat present. The pilots rated the likelihood that they would undertake each flight. Pilots were largely risk averse, as their ratings were all significantly influenced by threat. Results: The pilots whose ratings were significantly influenced by opportunity had been involved in more hazardous aviation incidents than the other pilots. In the final study, 32 qualified pilots completed both the risk tolerance measure and a simulated flight into adverse weather. The pilots who continued flying into adverse weather were less risk averse compared to the pilots who diverted. This further highlighted the link between risk tolerance and risk-taking, and suggested that some pilots may fly into adverse weather because of a greater tolerance of risk. Impact on Industry:The studies provide evidence that a measure of risk tolerance can predict potential accident involvement amongst general aviation pilots.","Introduction According to Lopes [Lopes, L.L.

1059,2019,Scientific reports,"Influences of age, mental workload, and flight experience on cognitive performance and prefrontal activity in private pilots: a fNIRS study","The effects of aging on cognitive performance must be better understood, especially to protect older individuals who are engaged in risky activities (e.g. aviation). Current literature on executive functions suggests that brain compensatory mechanisms may counter cognitive deterioration due to aging, at least up to certain task load levels. The present study assesses this hypothesis in private pilots engaged in two executive tasks from the standardized CANTAB battery, namely Spatial Working Memory (SWM) and  One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS). Sixty-one pilots from three age groups (young, middle-aged, older) performed these two tasks from low to very high difficulty levels, beyond those reported in previous aging studies. A fNIRS headband measured changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) in the prefrontal cortex. Results confirmed an overall effect of the difficulty level in the three age groups, with a decline in task performance and an increase in prefrontal HbO2 signal. Performance of older relative to younger pilots was impaired in both tasks, with the greatest impairment observed for the highest-load Spatial Working Memory task. Consistent with this behavioral deficit in older pilots, a plateau of prefrontal activity was observed at this highest-load level, suggesting that a ceiling in neural resources was reached. When behavioral performance was either equivalent between age groups or only slightly impaired in the older group, there were not any age-related differences in prefrontal activity. Finally, older pilots with extensive flying experience tend to show better preserved spatial working memory performance when compared to mildly-experienced of the same age group. The present findings are discussed in the frames of HAROLD and CRUNCH theoretical models of cognitive and neural aging, evoking the possibility that piloting expertise may contribute to preserve executive functions throughout adulthood.The effects of aging on cognitive performance must be better understood, especially to protect older individuals who are engaged in risky activities (e.g. aviation).

1060,2007,Psychological research,Fixed versus dynamic orientations in environmental learning from ground-level and aerial perspectives,"Ground-level and aerial perspectives in virtual space provide simplified conditions for investigating differences between exploratory navigation and map reading in large-scale environmental learning. General similarities and differences in ground-level and aerial encoding have been identified, but little is known about the specific characteristics that differentiate them. One such characteristic is the need to process orientation; ground-level encoding (and navigation) typically requires dynamic orientations, whereas aerial encoding (and map reading) is typically conducted in a fixed orientation. The present study investigated how this factor affected spatial processing by comparing ground-level and aerial encoding to a hybrid condition: aerial-with-turns. Experiment 1 demonstrated that scene recognition was sensitive to both perspective (ground-level or aerial) and orientation (dynamic or fixed). Experiment 2 investigated brain activation during encoding, revealing regions that were preferentially activated perspective as in previous studies (Shelton and Gabrieli in J Neurosci 22:2711-2717, 2002), but also identifying regions that were preferentially activated as a function of the presence or absence of turns. Together, these results differentiated the behavioral and brain consequences attributable to changes in orientation from those attributable to other characteristics of ground-level and aerial perspectives, providing leverage on how orientation information is processed in everyday spatial learning.Ground-level and aerial perspectives in virtual space provide simplified conditions for investigating differences between exploratory navigation and map reading in large-scale environmental learning.

1063,2014,Frontiers in psychology,Error management for musicians: an interdisciplinary conceptual framework,"Musicians tend to strive for flawless performance and perfection, avoiding errors at all costs. Dealing with errors while practicing or performing is often frustrating and can lead to anger and despair, which can explain musicians' generally negative attitude toward errors and the tendency to aim for flawless learning in instrumental music education. But even the best performances are rarely error-free, and research in general pedagogy and psychology has shown that errors provide useful information for the learning process. Research in instrumental pedagogy is still neglecting error issues; the benefits of risk management (before the error) and error management (during and after the error) are still underestimated. It follows that dealing with errors is a key aspect of music practice at home, teaching, and performance in public. And yet, to be innovative, or to make their performance extraordinary, musicians need to risk errors. Currently, most music students only acquire the ability to manage errors implicitly - or not at all. A more constructive, creative, and differentiated culture of errors would balance error tolerance and risk-taking against error prevention in ways that enhance music practice and music performance. The teaching environment should lay the foundation for the development of such an approach. In this contribution, we survey recent research in aviation, medicine, economics, psychology, and interdisciplinary decision theory that has demonstrated that specific error-management training can promote metacognitive skills that lead to better adaptive transfer and better performance skills. We summarize how this research can be applied to music, and survey-relevant research that is specifically tailored to the needs of musicians, including generic guidelines for risk and error management in music teaching and performance. On this basis, we develop a conceptual framework for risk management that can provide orientation for further music education and musicians at all levels.Musicians tend to strive for flawless performance and perfection, avoiding errors at all costs.

1083,2018,Journal of eye movement research,Using Eye-Movement Events to Determine the Mental Workload of Surgical Residents,"These days, eye-tracking is one of the promising technologies used in different fields such as aviation, arts, sports, psychology and driving for several purposes. Even though it is being used for health purposes, studies involving eye-tracking are rare in the field of endo-neurosurgery. This study aims to use this technology to promote our understanding of the effect related to computer-based instructional materials on mental workload of endo-neurosurgery residents. Four computer-based simulation scenarios are developed based on skill development requirements of endo-neurosurgery residents. Two of them were designed as general models and the other two as simulated surgical models. During these surgery procedures, in real settings, surgical residents need to use their both hands simultaneously to control the endoscope and the operational tool in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, to shed light on the participants' behaviors, these scenarios are performed with dominant-hand, non-dominant hand and, finally with both-hands using haptic interfaces. Twenty-three residents volunteered in this study. Their eye-movements were recorded while performing the scenarios. According to the results of this study, when performing the simulated surgical models, an increase in the participants' mental workload was recorded when compared to the other scenarios. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the eye-movements of surgical residents can provide insights about the anticipated level of difficulty about the skill-based tasks. This information might be very critical to properly design and organize instructional materials for endo-neurosurgery, and also to better guide and evaluate the progress of trainees in computer simulation-based skill training environments.These days, eye-tracking is one of the promising technologies used in different fields such as aviation, arts, sports, psychology and driving for several purposes.

Built on a cognitive human response model, Phoenix incorporates strong elements of current HRA good practices, leverages lessons learned from empirical studies, and takes advantage of the best features of existing and emerging HRA methods. Its original framework was introduced in previous publications. This paper reports on the completed methodology, summarizing the steps and techniques of its qualitative analysis phase. The methodology introduces the ""Crew Response Tree"" which provides a structure for capturing the context associated with Human Failure Events (HFEs), including errors of omission and commission. It also uses a team-centered version of the Information, Decision and Action cognitive model and ""macro-cognitive"" abstractions of crew behavior, as well as relevant findings from cognitive psychology literature and operating experience, to identify potential causes of failures and influencing factors during procedure-driven and knowledge-supported crew-plant interactions. The result is the set of identified HFEs and likely scenarios leading to each. The methodology itself is generic in the sense that it is compatible with various quantification methods, and can be adapted for use across different environments including nuclear, oil and gas, aerospace, aviation, and healthcare.","Phoenix method is an attempt to address various issues in the field of Human Reliability Analysis (HRA).

1089,2016,Analytical Chemistry,Application of LC-MS-Based Global Metabolomic Profiling Methods to Human Mental Fatigue,"Mental fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for work and a loss of capacity to respond to stimulation and is usually accompanied by a feeling of tiredness and drowsiness. Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers' urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively. Three candidate biomarkers were selected on the basis of statistical significance, coefficient of variance, and compared with data of the three groups. The results suggest that urine metabolites may provide a complete new clue from biochemistry to understand, monitor, and manage human mental fatigue.",Mental fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for work and a loss of capacity to respond to stimulation and is usually accompanied by a feeling of tiredness and drowsiness.

1091,2014,Instructional Science: An International Journal of the Learning Sciences,Enhancing Learning Outcomes in Computer-Based Training via Self-Generated Elaboration,"The present study investigated the utility of an instructional strategy known as the ""query method"" for enhancing learning outcomes in computer-based training. The query method involves an embedded guided, sentence generation task requiring elaboration of key concepts in the training material that encourages learners to ""stop and think"" about the information already presented before proceeding to new concepts. This study also investigated the effect of varying the level of elaboration (low or high) prompted by the queries. Fifty-one undergraduate students from the general psychology department subject pool at a major university in the southeastern United States received instruction on the basic principles of flight via one of three versions of a computer-based tutorial (no query, low-level elaboration query, or high-level elaboration query). Participants had no prior knowledge or previous experience with the aviation domain. A one-way between-groups design was employed, with the query method serving as the independent variable and a sample size of 17 per condition. Dependent variables included knowledge organization, knowledge acquisition, and instructional efficiency. Overall, results showed that incorporating low-level elaboration queries into the training resulted in improved organization, integration, and application of task-relevant knowledge and higher instructional efficiency. High-level elaboration queries consistently failed to produce significantly better post-training outcomes, possibly due to the increased cognitive load imposed on learners during training. The discussion centers on theoretical and practical implications for promoting and assessing learning outcomes in computer-based training.","The present study investigated the utility of an instructional strategy known as the ""query method"" for enhancing learning outcomes in computer-based training.

A best practice for researchers using statistics would therefore be to share data among co-authors, allowing double-checking of executed tasks just as co-pilots do in aviation. To document the extent to which this 'co-piloting' currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance.

1100,2010,Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science,Is situation awareness all in the mind?,"This paper addresses the fundamental discipline theoretic question of whether situation awareness is a phenomenon best described by psychology, engineering or systems ergonomics. Each of these disciplines places a different emphasis on the notion of what situation awareness is and how it manifests itself. The approach from psychology places situation awareness as something that can only exist in the minds of people in a system. This means that the unit of analysis is the individual and that team situation awareness is the summation of individual situation awareness. The engineering perspective puts situation awareness in the world, represented in the artefacts and objects that people use.

The motivation maintenance theory developed by Frederich Herzberg contends that two sets of factors can impinge on job satisfaction. Hygiene factors such as salary and working conditions can lead to job dissatisfaction. Motivators, such as job content and professional achievement are job satisfaction factors. A convenience sample of 69 reserve flight nurses from 8 flights was utilized in the survey approach.

Aviation-based crisis resource management (CRM) training using high-fidelity simulation has been proposed as a strategy to improve team behaviours. This review will address key considerations in CRM training and outline recommendations for the future of human factors education in healthcare.A critical examination of the current literature yields several important considerations to guide the development and implementation of effective simulation-based CRM training. These include defining a priori domain-specific objectives, creating an immersive environment that encourages deliberate practice and transfer-appropriate processing, and the importance of effective team debriefing. Building on research from high-risk industry, we suggest that traditional CRM training may be augmented with new training techniques that promote the development of shared mental models for team and task processes, address the effect of acute stress on team performance, and integrate strategies to improve clinical reasoning and the detection of cognitive errors.RECENT FINDINGSA critical examination of the current literature yields several important considerations to guide the development and implementation of effective simulation-based CRM training.

Whether a woman accepts this projected role as egosyntonic or rejects it as egosyntonic, its existence may affect her real-life role. For example, one woman pilot reported that her instructors seemed to make allowances for her sex by expecting less of her than they did of her male colleagues, ""carrying"" her along as if she were a little sister. While such role-casting may be carried on subconsciously, its behavioral manifestations are real and may have the potential for affecting flight safety.

Further research is needed to elucidate which situations pose the greatest risk for the occurrence of conformity, how to manage it in practice and its implications for patient safety.","Given that a significant portion of medical education occurs in various social settings (small groups, large classes, clinical environments), it is critical to examine how group members interact. One type of influence on these interactions is conformity, whereby an individual changes his or her own behaviour to match incorrect responses of others in a group. Conformity to peer pressure has been replicated in experimental research conducted in many countries over the last 60 years.","<title>The good and bad of group conformity: a call for a new programme of research in medical education</title> <excerpt>Given that a significant portion of medical education occurs in various social settings (small groups, large classes, clinical environments), it is critical to examine how group members interact.

Susceptibility to motion sickness was determined by scores on a motion sickness questionnaire (MSQ); only individuals with extreme scores were considered for inclusion in the experimental groups. The following tests were administered: Floor Ataxia Test Battery, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, Cornell Medical Index, Cornell Work Form, Eysenck Personality Inventory, Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, and the 16 Personality Factors test. Each subject was tested on at least three, but not more than six, of the eight tests. Significant sex differences were obtained on the ataxia battery and the Cornell Medical Index. Susceptible subjects did not differ significantly from nonsusceptibles on the ataxia battery but did differ significantly on all personality tests except the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (administered only to women) and the Rotter Scale. The generally consistent and significant patterns of results from the psychological tests probably reflect the selection factors used in defining the subject groups; certain personality characteristics are associated with a high degree of susceptibility to motion sickness.Four groups of 37 subjects each (highly susceptible men, highly susceptible women, nonsusceptible men, and nonsusceptible women) were obtained from a population of 2,432 college students ranging in age from 18 to 39 years.

1117,2009,Advances in cognitive psychology,"Designing informative warning signals: Effects of indicator type, modality, and task demand on recognition speed and accuracy","An experiment investigated the assumption that natural indicators which exploit existing learned associations between a signal and an event make more effective warnings than previously unlearned symbolic indicators. Signal modality (visual, auditory) and task demand (low, high) were also manipulated. Warning effectiveness was indexed by accuracy and reaction time (RT) recorded during training and dual task test phases. Thirty-six participants were trained to recognize 4 natural and 4 symbolic indicators, either visual or auditory, paired with critical incidents from an aviation context. As hypothesized, accuracy was greater and RT was faster in response to natural indicators during the training phase. This pattern of responding was upheld in test phase conditions with respect to accuracy but observed in RT only in test phase conditions involving high demand and the auditory modality. Using the experiment as a specific example, we argue for the importance of considering the cognitive contribution of the user (viz., prior learned associations) in the warning design process. Drawing on semiotics and cognitive psychology, we highlight the indexical nature of so-called auditory icons or natural indicators and argue that the cogniser is an indispensable element in the tripartite nature of signification.An experiment investigated the assumption that natural indicators which exploit existing learned associations between a signal and an event make more effective warnings than previously unlearned symbolic indicators.

1127,2019,Current opinion in psychology,Evaluation of strategies to train visual search performance in professional populations,"Visual search, the act of finding targets amongst distractors, is central to many professions with life-or-death implications including aviation security, radiology, lifeguarding, military, and more. As such, every effort should be taken to improve visual search performance. One potential path to improvement is to ensure that workforces are optimally trained. Broadly, there are three general components to train: (1) specific use of the machinery and user interface (i.e. 'knobology'), (2) target and distractor identification, and (3) search strategy. The current review considers the cognitive psychology aspects of these three components; each is evaluated in light of short-term and long-term training goals, as well as profession-specific constraints.Visual search, the act of finding targets amongst distractors, is central to many professions with life-or-death implications including aviation security, radiology, lifeguarding, military, and more.

1128,2020,Physiotherapy Canada. Physiotherapie Canada,Investigating Visual-Spatial Abilities in Students and Expert Physical Therapists,"Purpose: Visual-spatial abilities (VSAs) - the aptitude for mentally processing, retaining, and manipulating visual input - are used by physical therapists in movement analysis. Superior VSAs have been demonstrated in experts compared with novices in other fields, including surgery, anatomy, and aviation, but no literature has investigated VSAs in physical therapy. The purpose of this study was to quantify VSAs in expert and student physical therapists and investigate the differences between the two groups. Our results could assist future researchers in identifying areas for skill development and improved clinical competency in students and novice therapists. Method: Expert physical therapists and first-year PT students completed four computerized VSA tests in the Psychology Experiment Building Language programme: Four-Choice Response, Sequential Pattern Comparison, Mental Rotation, and Situation Awareness. Results: A total of 16 participants were recruited for each group. Expert physical therapists responded more accurately to the Four-Choice Response test, but not significantly so (p = 0.06), and with a significantly slower response time than student physical therapists (p = 0.03). No other differences were found. Conclusions: These findings suggest that expert physical therapists use selective attention more effectively and may value accuracy over speed. No differences were found in other measures of VSAs. Further studies are required to confirm and expand our findings.Purpose: Visual-spatial abilities (VSAs) - the aptitude for mentally processing, retaining, and manipulating visual input - are used by physical therapists in movement analysis.

1129,2017,Journal of Family Psychology,Implications of parent-child relationships for emerging adults' subjective feelings about adulthood,"Little is known about the role of parents in promoting their children's successful transition to adulthood, particularly for college students who may maintain stronger ties to parents than other emerging adults. The present study therefore investigated longitudinal implications of parent-child relationship qualities during emerging adults' first year of college for their feelings about the upcoming transition to adulthood 3 years later, as well as implications of 3 types of parental control (behavioral control, psychological control, helicopter parenting) for these associations. Multilevel models indicated that emerging adults who reported less negativity in their relationships with mothers and fathers felt more like adults 3 years later compared with emerging adults with low-quality relationships, while high levels of psychological control and helicopter parenting had detrimental implications for their vocational identity development and perceived competence regarding their transition to adulthood. However, nuanced interactions between parent-child relationship quality and parental control indicated that behavioral control had positive implications for outcomes if it occurred within the context of high-quality relationships, or when utilized with sons. The present study highlights the complex role that parents may play during college students' transition to adulthood, and future work should continue to examine ways that clinicians can incorporate parents as a potential resource for promoting emerging adults' successful transition to adulthood and the workforce.","Little is known about the role of parents in promoting their children's successful transition to adulthood, particularly for college students who may maintain stronger ties to parents than other emerging adults.

1137,2016,Analytical Chemistry (Washington),Application of LC-MS-Based Global Metabolomic Profiling Methods to Human Mental Fatigue,"Mental fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for work and a loss of capacity to respond to stimulation and is usually accompanied by a feeling of tiredness and drowsiness. Mental fatigue at work is a serious problem and can raise safety concerns especially in the transportation system. It is believed that mental fatigue is a direct or contributing cause of road and air related accidents and incidents. Psychological studies indicate that fatigue results in reduced work efficiency, alertness, and impaired mental performance. However, its underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the human body is an integrated system, and mental fatigue results in changes not only in psychology but also in biochemistry of the human body. These biochemical changes are detectable in metabolites. We employed global metabolomic profiling methods to screen biochemical changes that occur with mental fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCs) in civil aviation. A total of 45, all male, ATCs (two batches) were recruited as two mental fatigue groups and 23 executive staff acted as a control group for this study. The volunteers' urine samples were collected before and after their work. The samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry equipped with a polar, a weak polar, and a nonpolar column, respectively. Three candidate biomarkers were selected on the basis of statistical significance, coefficient of variance, and compared with data of the three groups. The results suggest that urine metabolites may provide a complete new clue from biochemistry to understand, monitor, and manage human mental fatigue.",Mental fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for work and a loss of capacity to respond to stimulation and is usually accompanied by a feeling of tiredness and drowsiness.

A variety of training methods have been used to assist pilots to anticipate the SD problem.

The questionnaire was completed by 368 out of 495 pilots; 189 currently flying fixed-wing, and 150 flying rotary-wing aircraft. On average, their age was 38, and they had 2466 flight hours on-type.RESULTS: Respondents gave high ratings for the importance of SD training and their awareness of SD, the latter being one of the training objectives. The amount of SD training received by respondents was positively correlated with ratings for appreciation and importance. Self-rated awareness was positively correlated with the number of reported SD experiences. Although the correlations were below 0.50, the results provide an indication that SD training is effective. In total, respondents reported 5773 SD experiences, 195 of them resulting in a serious risk for flight safety. Narratives of these serious events show that, in many cases, pilots managed their SD by carefully checking the flight instruments, and also by good crew coordination.DISCUSSION: The results of the survey provide some evidence, although based on subjective reports, for transfer of SD training.

Flight segments involved various combinations of maneuvering of heading, altitude and airspeed. Expert pilots performed better than novices on vertical and longitudinal, but not lateral control. They accomplished their superior vertical tracking by allocating more control resources to the vertical control. Analyses of scanning strategies revealed that experts: a) had shorter dwells and more frequent visits to most instruments; b) adapted their visiting strategy more flexibly in response to changing task demands; c) demonstrated a better mental model of cross-coupling and predictive relations between and within axes; and d) showed more frequent checking of axes whose values remained constant. The data is discussed in terms of their implications in pilot cockpit scan training program development.In order to examine differences in flying expertise, 12 novice and 12 expert pilots flew a 7-segment simulation pattern under specific attentional constraints while cockpit instrument visual scan was recorded.

1149,2007,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,"'It Does Not Harm the Environment!' An Analysis of Industry Discourses on Tourism, Air Travel and the Environment","While a substantial part of the population in Europe seems well informed about the phenomenon of climate change, uncertainty seems to prevail in terms of its seriousness, its consequences for society and action that needs to be taken in order to prevent 'dangerous interference with the climate system'. Many people seem to believe that there is no scientific consensus about climate change and that individual behavioural change is irrelevant in the face of uncertainty. Such a 'psychology of denial' seems particularly strong in the context of air travel, the fastest growing transport sector. This paper seeks to understand this phenomenon by analysing the discourses surrounding air travel. Four major industry discourses are identified: air travel is energy efficient and accounts only for marginal emissions of co...; air travel is economically and socially too important to be restricted; fuel use is constantly minimized and new technology will solve the problem, and air travel is treated unfairly in comparison to other means of transport. The validity of these claims is evaluated based on data and material presented in the scientific literature. Results show that there are substantial gaps between the discourses and the reality of aviation's environmental performance, which might partially explain the controversial understanding of air travel and its environmental consequences among the public.

The pilots rated the likelihood that they would undertake each flight. Pilots were largely risk averse, as their ratings were all significantly influenced by threat.The pilots whose ratings were significantly influenced by opportunity had been involved in more hazardous aviation incidents than the other pilots. In the final study, 32 qualified pilots completed both the risk tolerance measure and a simulated flight into adverse weather. The pilots who continued flying into adverse weather were less risk averse compared to the pilots who diverted. This further highlighted the link between risk tolerance and risk-taking, and suggested that some pilots may fly into adverse weather because of a greater tolerance of risk.RESULTSThe pilots whose ratings were significantly influenced by opportunity had been involved in more hazardous aviation incidents than the other pilots.

1157,2010,Spanish journal of psychology,Applying information theory to small groups assessment: emotions and well-being at work,"This paper explores and analyzes the relations between emotions and well-being in a sample of aviation personnel, passenger crew (flight attendants). There is an increasing interest in studying the influence of emotions and its role as psychosocial factors in the work environment as they are able to act as facilitators or shock absorbers. The contrast of the theoretical models by using traditional parametric techniques requires a large sample size to the efficient estimation of the coefficients that quantify the relations between variables. Since the available sample that we have is small, the most common size in European enterprises, we used the maximum entropy principle to explore the emotions that are involved in the psychosocial risks. The analyses show that this method takes advantage of the limited information available and guarantee an optimal estimation, the results of which are coherent with theoretical models and numerous empirical researches about emotions and well-being. // ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: En este artículo analizamos las relaciones entre las emociones y el bienestar en una muestra de trabajadores del sector aeronáutico, en concreto de tripulantes de cabina de pasajeros (TCP). De este modo respondemos al creciente papel que las emociones están teniendo en los riesgos psicosociales en el trabajo, de modo que pueden influir como agentes facilitadotes o como amortiguadores. Dado que la mayoría de las empresas en Europa poseen una plantilla media de pequeño tamaño, la aplicación de las técnicas paramétricas habituales presenta fuertes limitaciones a la hora de estimar los coeficientes que indican la relación entre las variables. En consecuencia, hemos optado por la aplicación del principio de la máxima entropía de la teoría de la información, que ha permitido obtener unas estimaciones óptimas sacando el máximo provecho a la escasa información disponible. Asimismo, los resultados son coherentes con la investigación previa, lo que comprueba su adecuación y hace que sea un procedimiento recomendable para los casos similares.

The objective of this study was to investigate how memory performance, in terms of encoding and/or retrieval processes, was affected by sustained +Gz exposure.There were 18 healthy men ranging from experienced fighter pilots to novice riders who participated. A word continuous recognition task (CRT) was employed as a memory test. The task consisted of three consecutive phases: 1) encoding of familiar words at 1 G; 2) encoding and retrieval of words at 70% of the subject's relaxed G-tolerance level, equivalent to +3.7 +/- 0.54 Gz; and 3) encoding and retrieval of words at 1 G. In addition, each subject performed the CRT in a 1-G-only control condition. Physiological and psycho-physiological measures included continuous monitoring of ECG, arterial oxygen saturation, arterial BP at head level, and response time.METHODThere were 18 healthy men ranging from experienced fighter pilots to novice riders who participated.

Four seminal issues that threaten the interpretation of the results of ability studies are introduced and examined.  A brief history of the use of g in pilot selection is presented, going back to the World War I era.  At that time, many countries used tests such as perception and reaction time, later shown to be mostly measures of g.  The World War II era brought the age of the multiple aptitude batteries, and with it, the theory of differential abilities.  However, most militaries still used highly g-saturated measures.  More recently, an awareness of the prominence of g in job performance has led to a series of studies that showed the central role of g in predicting pilot success.  In comparative analyses, g was found to be a better predictor of pilot criteria than specific abilities.  However, some specific abilities or measures of job knowledge were found to increment the predictiveness of g.

1170,2008,Journal of Safety Research,Risk tolerance and pilot involvement in hazardous events and flight into adverse weather,"According to Lopes [Lopes, L.L. (1987). Between hope and fear: The psychology of risk. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 20, 255-295] tolerance of risk may be governed by sensitivity to either the opportunities for gain or threats of loss involved. In the initial study, qualified pilots were presented with 36 written flight scenarios that varied in the levels of opportunity and threat present. The pilots rated the likelihood that they would undertake each flight. Pilots were largely risk averse, as their ratings were all significantly influenced by threat. The pilots whose ratings were significantly influenced by opportunity had been involved in more hazardous aviation incidents than the other pilots. In the final study, 32 qualified pilots completed both the risk tolerance measure and a simulated flight into adverse weather. The pilots who continued flying into adverse weather were less risk averse compared to the pilots who diverted. This further highlighted the link between risk tolerance and risk-taking, and suggested that some pilots may fly into adverse weather because of a greater tolerance of risk. The studies provide evidence that a measure of risk tolerance can predict potential accident involvement amongst general aviation pilots.","According to Lopes [Lopes, L.L. (1987).

Many lessons have been learned since the early days of debriefing support, and the roles and tasks of deployed Australian Army Psychology Corps (AAPsych) personnel have expanded considerably. These tasks include: the conduct of tailored predeployment training, including tactical negotiation and hostage survival strategies; direct support to some operational tasks, such as the design and evaluation of information operations; provision of advice about human factors aspects of operational effectiveness, such as fatigue management; and applied research into operational factors, for example, the identification of the main stressors of different deployments. At present AAPsych makes significant contributions to readiness through training support and to the maintenance of mental health through various stress management interventions. It has a significant role in support of Army aviation. AAPsych is prepared to manage combat stress casualties in the event of warfare and is developing expertise to support other tasks such as information operations. The chapter concludes with a view to the future, where we anticipate an increasing focus of operational psychology on direct contributions to operational effectiveness through the application of refined and operationally relevant behavioural science techniques, advice, and research.

Thus, a relatively new discipline called neuroergonomics is holding the promise of studying the neural mechanisms underlying human performance in pursuit of both theoretical and practical insights. In this work, we utilized a neuroergonomic approach by combining insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition to study flight expertise. Specifically, we focused on the Mirror Neuron system as a key correlate for understanding the interaction between an individual and the environment, suggesting that it can be used to index changes in the coupling of perception-action associated with skill development. In this study, we measured the EEG mu suppression as a proxy of the Mirror Neuron system in experts (pilots) and novices while performing a distance estimation task in a landing scenario. To survey the specificity of this measure, we considered central, parietal and occipital electrode pools and analyzed alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-25 Hz) rhythm bands. We hypothesized that in experts vs. novices, specific neural sensorimotor brain activity would underpin the connection between perception and action in an in-flight context. Preliminary results indicate that alpha and beta rhythm suppression was area-specific irrespective of groups, present in the central electrodes placed over the motor areas. Group analysis revealed that specifically alpha mu rhythm, but not beta, was significantly more suppressed in pilots vs. novices. Complementing these findings we found a trend in which the strength of mu suppression increased with the sense of presence experienced by the pilots. Such sensorimotor activation is in line with the idea that for a pilot, a distance judgment is intimately associated with the function of landing. This reflects the ability to use optical invariants to see the world in terms of the capabilities of the aircraft (e.g., reachability and glide angle). These preliminary findings support the role of embodied simulation mechanisms in visual perception and add important insights into a practical understanding of flight expertise, suggesting sensorimotor mechanisms as potential neuro-markers.Over the last decade, the efforts toward unraveling the complex interplay between the brain, body, and environment have set a promising line of research that utilizes neuroscience to study human performance in natural work contexts such as aviation.

1180,2013,Science and engineering ethics,Introducing survival ethics into engineering education and practice,"Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life. This crisis calls for an ethics that furnishes effective motives to take global action necessary for survival. We propose a research program for understanding why ethical principles change across time and culture. We also propose provisional motives and methods for reaching global consensus on engineering field ethics. Current interdisciplinary research in ethics, psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary theory grounds these proposals. Experimental ethics, the application of scientific principles to ethical studies, provides a model for developing policies to advance solutions. A growing literature proposes evolutionary explanations for moral development. Connecting these approaches necessitates an experimental or scientific ethics that deliberately examines theories of morality for reliability. To illustrate how such an approach works, we cover three areas. The first section analyzes cross-cultural ethical systems in light of evolutionary theory. While such research is in its early stages, its assumptions entail consequences for engineering education. The second section discusses Howard University and University of Puerto Rico/Mayagüez (UPRM) courses that bring ethicists together with scientists and engineers to unite ethical theory and practice. We include a syllabus for engineering and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) ethics courses and a checklist model for translating educational theory and practice into community action. The model is based on aviation, medicine and engineering practice. The third and concluding section illustrates Howard University and UPRM efforts to translate engineering educational theory into community action. Multidisciplinary teams of engineering students and instructors take their expertise from the classroom to global communities to examine further the ethicality of prospective technologies and the decision-making processes that lead to them.Given the possibilities of synthetic biology, weapons of mass destruction and global climate change, humans may achieve the capacity globally to alter life.

1181,2014,PloS one,Statistical Reporting Errors and Collaboration on Statistical Analyses in Psychological Science,"Statistical analysis is error prone. A best practice for researchers using statistics would therefore be to share data among co-authors, allowing double-checking of executed tasks just as co-pilots do in aviation. To document the extent to which this 'co-piloting' currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance. Overall, the probability that a given p-value was inconsistent was over 10%. Co-piloting was not found to be associated with reporting errors.Statistical analysis is error prone.

However, the application and analysis of success of these new methodologies are as yet unknown.METHODS: The military adapted the civil reverse periodization training system, composed of 6 wk and five sessions per week. For the first 3 wk soldiers performed two sessions with the objective of increasing the maximal strength of the upper and lower body muscles, and three sessions of short high-intensity interval training (HIIT). In the following 3 wk they combined two endurance HIIT and two resistance HIIT sessions with military equipment while conducting a military task.RESULTS: After the training a significant body mass index decrease was found, along with an increase in lower limb muscular strength, aerobic and anaerobic performance, resilience, stress tolerance, and psychological flexibility. Regarding the ratio of acceptance there was an increased ratio compared to previous years of 7%. In addition, married soldiers with children presented greater resilience, stress tolerance, psychological flexibility, and a higher ratio of success.DISCUSSION: Accepted soldiers presented greater psychological status and stress tolerance, highlighting the importance of the work of the unit psychologists to reinforce and monitor the psychometric profile of the soldiers as well as their intrinsic characteristics of personality and emotionality.

1187,1976,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",Associations between psychological factors and pulmonary toxicity during intermittent oxygen breathing at 2 ATA,"Associations between the psychological and pulmonary effects of breathing intermittent oxygen at 2 ATA were examined among four experienced divers. A fifth diver, who served as a control, breathed only normoxic nitrogen. Psychological tests included digit span, short-term memory for easy and difficult word associations, simple and complex psychomotor performance, and reported moods. The criterion of oxygen toxicity was the total hours of intermittent oxygen exposure tolerated before developing a 10% reduction in vital capacity. Short-term memory for difficult word associations and self-reported moods of Activity, Depression, Fatigue, and Happiness were found to be significantly correlated with this criterion of oxygen toxicity. Part of the impairment found on these measures, however, was probably related to the absence of adequate sleep and rest as evidenced by the worsened performance of the control diver over the 15-h testing period. The results replicated the findings of earlier research on the psychological effects of continuous oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions and at 1 ATA, and may indicate that oxygen intesifies the effects of other stressors such as fatigue. In addition, the results showed that reported moods may be important indicators of impending pulmonary toxicity during intermittent oxygen exposure.Associations between the psychological and pulmonary effects of breathing intermittent oxygen at 2 ATA were examined among four experienced divers.

1191,2007,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,"'It Does Not Harm the Environment!' An Analysis of Industry Discourses on Tourism, Air Travel and the Environment","While a substantial part of the population in Europe seems well informed about the phenomenon of climate change, uncertainty seems to prevail in terms of its seriousness, its consequences for society and action that needs to be taken in order to prevent 'dangerous interference with the climate system'. Many people seem to believe that there is no scientific consensus about climate change and that individual behavioural change is irrelevant in the face of uncertainty. Such a 'psychology of denial' seems particularly strong in the context of air travel, the fastest growing transport sector. This paper seeks to understand this phenomenon by analysing the discourses surrounding air travel. Four major industry discourses are identified: air travel is energy efficient and accounts only for marginal emissions of CO sub(2); air travel is economically and socially too important to be restricted; fuel use is constantly minimized and new technology will solve the problem, and air travel is treated unfairly in comparison to other means of transport. The validity of these claims is evaluated based on data and material presented in the scientific literature. Results show that there are substantial gaps between the discourses and the reality of aviation's environmental performance, which might partially explain the controversial understanding of air travel and its environmental consequences among the public.","While a substantial part of the population in Europe seems well informed about the phenomenon of climate change, uncertainty seems to prevail in terms of its seriousness, its consequences for society and action that needs to be taken in order to prevent 'dangerous interference with the climate system'.

1194,2004,"Gender, work and organization",The impact of human factors on ab initio pilot training,"This article examines critically the power effects of a branch of psychology called Human Factors within the context of commercial aviation. A review of the aviation literature highlights the significance of Human Factors and its relevance to the recruitment and training of ab initio pilots. However, research in the field is criticized for failing to account for existing power relations and the potential effects of a new discursive format. This article uses the concept of discourse associated with Michel Foucault to analyse empirical data from interviews with individuals involved in ab initio pilot training at a European flying college. The analysis illustrates how staff at the training college use the rhetoric of Human Factors to enhance their own contribution and status, without fundamentally changing existing practices. Although this reinforces existing power relations, the Human Factors discourse also potentially empowers a different set of management employees. By illustrating the conflicting values and interests of two sets of managers and trainers at the college, the article is able to demonstrate the negative effects of the new discursive format on male ab initio pilots. It also discusses attitudes to female pilots, contributing to the debate about the ability of management discourses to promote gender equality within commercial organizations.

1195,2022,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,A systematic scoping review and textual narrative synthesis of physical and mixed‐reality simulation in pre‐service teacher training,"BackgroundDue to recent lockdown conditions, which restricted opportunities for face‐to‐face contact and the ability to be physically in schools, the need for novel, safe ways to train pre‐service teachers emerged even more pressingly. Whilst virtual simulation has received some attention in pedagogy and its benefits have been demonstrated in many disciplines, there appears to be less synthesized evidence on the use of physical and/or mixed‐reality simulation utilized in teacher training.ObjectivesThe goal of this systematic scoping review was to summarize and synthesize the literature on the use of physical and/or mixed‐reality simulation in pre‐service teacher training.MethodsA systematic scoping literature review combined with a textual narrative synthesis was undertaken. Ten reference databases were searched in May 2020: Academic search premier, CINAHL, Education Research Complete, Humanities International Complete, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, PsycInfo, Teacher Reference Center, Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus.Results and ConclusionsFollowing inclusion/exclusion criteria assessment and screening, 13 articles were included for appraisal and synthesis. Seven papers examined physical simulations, while the remainder examined mixed‐reality simulations. The evidence from this review suggests that simulation, including physical and mixed‐reality types, could be used as a tool to increase confidence, self‐efficacy, classroom management skills and communication.ImplicationsIn comparison to other fields (e.g., nursing, medicine and aviation) simulation in education appears to be in its infancy—more large‐scale research is needed. At the same time, this review indicates that mixed‐reality simulation in particular has the potential for contributing to teacher education, because it offers the potential for learning in various contexts when compared to traditional didactic teaching practices.","BackgroundDue to recent lockdown conditions, which restricted opportunities for face‐to‐face contact and the ability to be physically in schools, the need for novel, safe ways to train pre‐service teachers emerged even more pressingly.
