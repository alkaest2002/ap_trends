Drawing on the effort–recovery model and broaden-and-build theory, we proposed that job performance on a particular day fosters evening relaxation and next-morning positive affect and that this leads to increased deep acting and decreased surface acting the next day. To test our propositions, we conducted 2 diary studies using the experienced sampling method.</excerpt>",113

Although job crafting as a principal driver of work engagement has recently received much attention from academics, little is known about the processes and conditions in which employees who craft their tasks become engaged. In order to address these research gaps, we hypothesize that psychological capital (PsyCap) is likely to mediate the association between job crafting and work engagement, and that coworker support, rather than supervisor support, is likely to moderate the relationship between job crafting and PsyCap.</excerpt>",27

The SART features the opposite response requirements, which supposedly leads it to promote a mindless, non-thoughtful approach to the vigilance task To test that notion, we compared the SART to the traditional vigilance format (TVF) in terms of diagnostic accuracy assessed through decision theory measures of positive and negative predictive power (PPP and NPP), perceived mental workload indexed by the Multiple Resource Questionnaire, and oculomotor activity reflected in the Nearest Neighbor Index and fixation dwell times.Method: Observers in TVF and SART conditions monitored a video display for collision flight paths in a simulated air traffic control task.Results: Diagnostic accuracy in terms of NPP was high in both format conditions. While PPP was poorer in the SART than in the TVF, that result could be accounted for by a loss of motor control rather than a lack of mindfulness.</excerpt>",70

However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (eg, tracking the aircraft's position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.Conclusion: We found that while pilots' instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation..</excerpt>",8

In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.Application: Like traditional individual task or job analysis, this information can serve as the basis for specified human resource functions and interventions, and as diagnostic indicators as well. © 2012 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society..</excerpt>",125

Traditionally, selective attention was thought to facilitate perception by increasing the gain of sensory neurons tuned to the defining features of a behaviorally relevant object (eg, color, orientation, etc.). In contrast, recent mathematical models counterintuitively suggest that, in many cases, attentional gain should be applied to neurons that are tuned away from relevant features, especially when discriminating highly similar stimuli.</excerpt>",63

Some theories argue for scalability by making the implicit assumption that complex tasks consist of many smaller parts, which are learned according to basic learning principles. Surprisingly, there has been rather sparse empirical testing of this crucial assumption. In this article, we examine this assumption directly by decomposing the learning in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air-Traffic Controller Task (Ackerman, 1988) from the learning at the global level all the way down to the learning at the keystroke level.</excerpt>",21

Conflicts can principally arise in several ways: when duty has to be performed as night- or shiftwork, when phase shifts in the environmental timing system occur, when the time cues in the environment change their frequency or intensity, and when they completely disappear. All these sources of interference have in common that they cause disparity between the internal 'body time' and the external time of the environment.</excerpt>",24

These problems stem from crewmember tension and its displacement to the outside monitoring personnel, and from disruptions in crew cohesion and unclear leadership roles. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that crew tension and dysphoria would transiently increase following stressful events and be greater in the second half of a mission; that cohesion would be less during the second half of a mission; that tension and dysphoria would be displaced to the outside monitoring personnel; and that high levels of leader support and control would produce high levels of cohesion.</excerpt>",7

Factors intrinsic to the nature of the job, role ambiguity and conflict, poor relationships at work, lack of career development, inadequate organisation structure/climate, and problems associated with the interface between work and homelife are the focal points of attention. Many of these sources of occupational stress are prevalent in the field of aviation, and may be exacerbated by the move toward deregulation and increasing commercial competition within the industry..</excerpt>",18

Use of interrater agreement as a reliability index and 2 cutoff points for the partition of the sample resulted in the elimination of about 1/3 of the initial sample and the formation of 2 subsamples: the 'sick' (N = 45) and 'not sick' (N = 73) sailors. By using differentially weighted scores for various intensities of seasickness, it was demonstrated that 2 normally confounded aspects of seasickness can be assessed independently: physical symptoms, which constitute the apparent severity of the sickness (A.S.S.), and level of actual performance (A.P.), which reflects the individual's attempts to cope with the sickness.</excerpt>",33

The model suggests that the optimum combination of relations providing glide-slope information is dependent on the range from the runway threshold and that there is a relation between the handling qualities of aircraft or flight simulators and the adjustment of the weights..</excerpt>",32

Other issues of aerospace psychiatry involve maintenance of mental resilience and hardiness during a flying career, aeromedical decisions about when to remove from flight duties and when to return, criteria for waivers for psychiatric conditions, use of medications for treatment of psychiatric symptoms, questions of substance abuse, and research in such areas as genetics. This report reviews the basis for military aerospace psychiatry, primarily as practiced in the United States Air Force (USAF), and presents some of its underlying principles as they apply to clinical situations..</excerpt>",4
